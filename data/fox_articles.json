  "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the Capitol riots and the January 6 committee's primetime hearing on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Yet the other networks can't be bothered to cover any of that tonight. Instead, they've interrupted their regularly scheduled programing to bring you yet another extended primetime harangue from Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney about Donald Trump and QAnon. The whole thing is insulting. In fact, it's deranged and we're not playing along. This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live. They are lying, and we are not going to help them do it. What we will do instead is to try to tell you the truth. We've attempted to do that since the day this happened.We hated seeing vandalism at the U.S. Capitol a year and a half ago, and we said so at the time, but we did not think it was an insurrection because it was not an insurrection. It was not even close to an insurrection. Not a single person in the crowd that day was found to be carrying a firearm \u2013 some insurrection. In fact, the only person who wound up shot to death was a protester. She was a 36-year-old military veteran called Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was just over 5 feet tall. She was unarmed. She posed no conceivable threat to anyone, but Capitol Hill Police shot her in the neck and never explained why that was justified. Those are the facts of January 6, but since the very first hours, they have been distorted beyond recognition, relentlessly culminating with last night. Last night, CBS Nightly News told its viewers that insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6 'caused the deaths of five police officers.' That is a pure lie. There is nothing true about it, and they know that perfectly well. Here's reporter Bob Costa, who should be deeply ashamed to say something this dishonest. It's hard to believe he said that. Rioters cause the deaths of five police officers. You just heard CBS News tell its viewers that. This must be the big lie theory. The more bewilderingly false a claim is, the more likely you will be to believe it. Apparently, that's what they're betting on. In fact, precisely zero police officers were killed by rioters on January 6, not five, none. Not a single one. So, how'd they get to five? Well, CBS is counting the suicides of local police officers that took place after January 6, in some cases, long after January 6. Suicide, unfortunately, is pretty common among cops. Policing is a tough job, as we've noted. But in these specific cases, the ones CBS is referring to, the chief of Washington DC's police department told The New York Times that actually he had no idea if his officers were driven to kill themselves by January 6. CBS just made that up.The fifth death that CBS News is referring to is of Capitol Hill police officer Brian Sicknick. You will remember his name. Sicknick's body lay in state at the Capitol after the media told us he'd been beaten to death by Trump voters with a fire extinguisher. Here's what they told you. Once again, that's not true. Everything you just heard was completely fabricated. The D.C. medical examiner performed an autopsy and the autopsy report showed that Officer Brian Sicknick had not suffered any kind of blunt force trauma. He was not beaten to death. He died of a stroke in his office later. No one has been charged in Officer Sicknick's death because Officer Sicknick wasn't murdered. They are lying to you. That is provable. Not a single person you just saw has apologized for lying. Not a single one. And it's not just the news media. Here's Congressman Pete Aguilar of California claiming that officers lost their lives on January 6. Let's rally around the truth, he says, as he lies to you. May those words burn your tongue, liar. But what did happen exactly on January 6? What's the truth of that day? Well, that's still unknown. From the extensive video we have of January 6, it's clear that some in the crowd, more than a few, were encouraging protesters to breach the Capitol, to commit felonies. We're not guessing at that, we've showed you the tape. We have pictures of their faces. In the case of a man called Ray Epps, we know his name, but they've never been charged. Ray Epps was standing in exactly the same place that a lot of people who went to jail were standing, but he wasn't charged. His name was taken off the FBI's Most Wanted list. Why is that? It doesn't make any sense at all.The January 6 committee will not explain that after a year, millions of dollars and a thousand interviews. They won't tell us, nor will they tell us how many FBI agents and assets were in the crowd that day and what were they doing there. Why can't we know that? And why are they still hiding thousands of hours of surveillance footage from within the Capitol? If the point of the committee was to get the truth out there, why can't we see the tape? Why did authorities open the doors of the Capitol to rioters and let them walk in, usher them in the doors? That's utterly bizarre. You saw that live. No one's ever explained it. What's the explanation for that? And by the way, whatever happened to the mysterious pipe bomber whose bombs we later learned many months later, Kamala Harris' bodyguards discovered. Kamala Harris told us she was at the Capitol that day, but she wasn't. She was at the DNC with a pipe bomb outside. Her bodyguards found that bomb, but she lied about that. She hid that. Why? That's got to be one of the weirdest stories ever. What does it mean, Liz Cheney? Silence. And of course, above all, they lied about the reason that January 6 happened in the first place and you know what it is. The entire country watched Joe Biden get what they claim was 10 million more votes than Barack Obama himself got. Joe Biden got 10 million more votes than Barack Obama got, and a lot of those votes arrived after the election. In a lot of places, voting was stopped in the middle of the night. Why? In the biggest states in the country, voter ID was optional. Why is that okay? A lot of the protesters on January 6 were very upset about that and they should have been. All of us should be, but the January 6 Committee ignored all of that completely. Instead, on the basis of zero evidence, no evidence whatsoever, they blamed the entire riot on White supremacy. Here's Joe Biden. What? There's no evidence for that \u2013 none. The people at the Capitol, including the ones who broke the law by entering the Capitol, which is a crime, those people to a person said they were upset because they believed their democracy had been stolen from them and whether all of their claims are true or not, that's a valid reason to be upset. But rather than reassure the rest of us that actually our democracy is sound, elections are fair and transparent, there's no cheating and we can prove it, rather than do that, they call half the country names and not just names, the worst thing you can be called, a White supremacist. And then, most bewilderingly of all, virtually no Republican in Washington pushed back against any of that. In fact, Lindsey Graham, violence worshiper to the end, said that his only regret was that the Capitol Police didn't shoot more Trump voters in the neck and kill them. 'You've got guns, use them,' Graham said. So here you have a sitting U.S. senator, a Republican, urging police officers to shoot unarmed Americans, many of whom were ushered into the Capitol building by law enforcement. How can people talk like that? For more than a year, they justified rhetoric like Lindsey Graham 'shoot more' by claiming that January 6 was an insurrection. That's not a word they were used to describe, say, the monthslong siege of a courthouse in Portland, or the ongoing coordinated effort to intimidate Supreme Court justices at their homes with guns, a story they ignored today. But January 6 was different, they reminded us. It was unique because it was their offices and because it bothered Nancy Pelosi. We are not defending and would never defend vandalism, violence, rioting. We disapproved of it when it happened. We disapprove of it now, all riots, not just this one. But this was not an insurrection.But, you know what will get you to insurrection? If you ignore the legitimate concerns of a population, if you brush them aside as if they don't matter when gas goes to $5 and you say 'buy an electric car.' When cities become so filthy and so dangerous that you can't live there, when the economy becomes so distorted that your own children have no hope of getting married and giving you grandchildren, when you don't care at all about any of that and all you do is talk about yourself, nonstop \u2013 you might get an insurrection if you behave like that, speaking of insurrection."

The prosecutor said he did not agree with their assertion that 'thanks to a biased press, practically everyone in D.C., without knowing any of the facts, is convinced that the Rhodes defendants are guilty.'Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

  "description": "Tucker Carlson investigates a new report suggesting the FBI may have been involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot.",
  "date": "June 16, 2021 12:57am EDT",
  "text": "'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host says there is an 'unprecedented' effort to 'round up' dissentersBut that\u2019s not what our leaders are doing. They\u2019re doing just the opposite. They\u2019re working hard to divide us into warring camps with lies. They\u2019re telling us a story that is completely \u2014 and very much intentionally \u2014 disconnected from reality. They\u2019re claiming that something called white supremacy, a term they never define, is the greatest threat we face. A greater threat than Al Qaeda or ISIS. Our thoroughly craven attorney general told us that very lie today.That was the Attorney General of the United States stating a fact backed up by the FBI. So it\u2019s fair to ask the obvious questions.Under normal circumstances, we wouldn\u2019t quote a foreign adversary criticizing our government, but honestly, those are entirely fair questions. Who did shoot Ashli Babbit? Why don\u2019t we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That\u2019s OK now? No, it\u2019s not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protesters still in prison on trespassing charges, while so many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What\u2019s the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call it scary. We\u2019d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator. We ought to be asking those questions, urgently. Because as the attorney general reminded us, a lot depends on the answers. At least one news organization is. Revolver.news is a new site and turned out to be one of the last honest outlets on the internet. A new piece on the site suggests an answer to some of these questions. We know the government is hiding the identity of many law enforcement officers who were present at the capitol on January 6, not just the one who killed Ashli Babbitt. According to the government's own court filings, those law enforcement officers participated in the riot.Sometimes in violent ways.We know that because, without fail, the government has thrown the book at most of the people who were in the Capitol on January 6. There was a nationwide dragnet to find them. Many of them are still in solitary confinement tonight. But, strangely, some people who participated in the riot haven't been charged. Look at the documents. The government calls these people 'unindicted co-conspirators.' What does that mean? It means that in potentially every case, they're FBI operatives.For example, one of those 'unindicted co-conspirators' is someone the government identifies only as 'Person Two.' According to those documents, 'Person Two' stayed in the same hotel room as an 'insurrectionist' named Thomas Caldwell, who's alleged to be a member of the group called the Oath Keepers. 'Person Two' also 'stormed the barricades' at the Capitol on January 6, alongside Thomas Caldwell.The government's indictments further indicate that Caldwell -- who by the way is a 65-year-old man -- was led to believe there would be a 'quick reaction force' also participating in January 6. That quick reaction force, Caldwell was told, would be led by someone called 'Person Three' -- who had a hotel room and an accomplice. But wait. Here\u2019s the interesting thing. 'Person Two' and 'Person Three' were organizers of the riot. The government knows who they are, but the government has not charged them. Why is that? You know why. They were almost certainly working for the FBI. So FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6, according to government documents. And those two are not alone.In all, Revolver News reported that there are,quote, 'upwards of 20 unindicted co-conspirators in the Oath Keeper indictments, all playing various roles in the conspiracy, who have not been charged for virtually the exact same activities \u2014 and in some cases much, much more severe activities \u2014 as those named alongside them in indictments.' Huh? So it turns out this white supremacist insurrection was, again, by the government\u2019s own admission in these documents, organized, at least in part, by government agents.Are you shocked? You shouldn't be. In March, the FBI director admitted the bureau is infiltrating as many dissident groups as it possibly could.Wait a second \u2013 there\u2019s a huge difference between using an informant to find out what a group you find threatening might do, and paying people to organize a violent action, which is what happened, apparently according to government documents, on January 6.The mastermind, the bureau said, was a man called Adam Fox. Who was Adam Fox? He turned out to be a homeless guy who was living in the basement of a vacuum repair shop.The whole story was a farce. Insulting really. But if you read the government's charging documents carefully, and you should, you'll see that it gets even more ridiculous. It turns out that one of the five people in the planned 'Gretchen Whitmer kidnap van' was an FBI agent. In the van. Another was an FBI informant. The feds admit that an informant or undercover agent was 'usually present' in the group\u2019s meetings. In other words, nearly half the gang of kidnappers were working for the FBI. Remember the guy who suggested using a bomb to blow up a bridge as part of the plot? That got a lot of coverage. That guy was an undercover FBI agent.If you wondered why they're always comparing January 6 to 9/11, there's your answer. They're using the same tactics. And a lot of us missed this the first time around. We didn\u2019t see the obvious. If you empower the government to violate civil liberties in pursuit of a foreign terror organization, and there are foreign terror organizations, it\u2019s just a matter of time before ambitious politicians use those same mechanisms to suppress political dissent. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now. We should have seen it earlier.Trevor Aaronson's book 'The Terror Factory' analyzed every terrorism prosecution from 2001 to 2013. Aaronson found that at least 50 defendants were on trial because of behavior that the FBI had not only encouraged, but enabled. FBI agents were essentially the plotters in these crimes. They made the crimes, crimes. In 2012, a writer for The Nation called Petra Bartosiewicz found that FBI informants had quote,'Crossed the line from merely observing potential criminal behavior, which is allowed and good, to encouraging and assisting people to participate in plots that are largely scripted by the FBI itself.'And we checked. We looked carefully, and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. One of those plots was an Islamic terrorist attack in 2015 in Garland Texas. It turns out the FBI played an active role in that shooting.So they\u2019re doing that to Islamic radicals, what are they doing to American citizens? That should worry you. In a moment of uncharacteristic honesty, a former FBI Assistant Director calledFrank Figliuzzi explained on MSNBC. The goal is to round up political dissenters and throw them in solitary -- including members of Congress.Why not round up the FBI operatives who were rioting on January 6? Why not identify the guy who killed Ashli Babbit? This is crazy, and we should resist it."

  "description": "Capitol Police say they\u2019re prepared for what is expected to be an emotional day today, marking one year since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of President Biden\u2019s presidential win.",

  "text": "Capitol Police say they\u2019re prepared for what is expected to be an emotional day, with multiple vigils, commemorations and demonstrations planned in the nation\u2019s capital.On Jan. 6, 2021, after weeks of then-President Trump claiming the 2020 election had been stolen from him, thousands of his supporters broke off from his rally at Freedom Plaza near the White House and headed toward the Capitol Complex.Lawmakers were forced to evacuate the complex and temporarily suspend the certification of the Electoral College results as rioters plowed through police perimeters, breached the building and occupied it for several hours.Brian Sicknick, a 42-year-Capitol Police officer, was pepper-sprayed during the chaos and died the next day after suffering from two thromboembolic strokes. Four other officers who responded to the riot committed suicide in the months following.The counting of the electoral votes resumed hours after the riot, and then-Vice President Mike Pence declared Biden the winner.McCarthy, who spoke to Trump on Jan. 6, told local CBS affiliate KBAK that he didn't 'have anything to add' regarding the House committee's investigation and maintained that he has been very public about that day and has nothing to hide.About 275 Capitol riot defendants have been charged with a felony offense of attempting to 'corruptly obstruct, influence, or impede' the Electoral College certification, the report said.Most of those sentenced so far were convicted of misdemeanors, such as illegally entering the Capitol building, andfewer than half of those sentenced have received prison time. The median prison sentence for the Capitol rioters to date is 45 days, Politico reported.Palmer\u2019s prison sentence is more than a year and a half longer than any other defendant, Politico reported.More than 530 defendants have yet to stand trial, but a handful of trials are tentatively scheduled to begin in April, CBS News reported.Nearly a year after the Capitol attack, more than 130 Capitol Police officers have left the department. The Capitol Police, at this point, is nearly 400 officers short of its authorized level.U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, who took over the force in July, told the Senate Rules Committee in written testimony on Wednesday that of the 103recommendations issued by theCapitol Police Inspector General to strengthen security at the Capitol, 'we have implementedand/or addressedover90 of them.''The one thing that we have not been able to fix, so to speak, are the staffing issues, and we've lost over 130 officers that have left through either retirements or resignations after January 6,' he said.'We're aware of several events that are planned for Thursday, most of them aren't of much concern to us,' he said. 'There's no intelligence that indicates that there would be any problems.'The police chief did, however, point to one event that authorities are keeping their eye on, a planned demonstration by Look Ahead America, a conservative group demanding justice for those still jailed after last year's riot.'There's one event that is occurring, I think down at the D.C. jail that we're paying attention to, but again, really nothing that is of great concern to us at this point,' Manger said.The top Republican on the Committee on House Administration, Rep. Rodney Davis, penned a memo to GOP colleagues Monday titled: 'One Year Later, Little Has Changed.'Davis wrote that there are 'important facts that cannot be ignored about what occurred before, during, and after that day,' saying that Democrats on the Jan. 6 Committee are 'no closer to finding out what led to the catastrophic security failure,' and instead are hellbent to 'attack President Trump and punish anyone associated with him.''The events of January 6, 2021 exposed serious security vulnerabilities at the Capitol Complex,' Davis wrote. 'Unfortunately, over the past twelve months, House Democrats have been more interested in exploiting the events of January 6th for political purposes than in conducting basic oversight of the security vulnerabilities exposed that day.'At 2:30 p.m., lawmakers will begin sharing testimonials of the attack in a session led by Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., which will then be capped off with a bicameral prayer vigil on the Capitol Center Steps at 5:30 p.m.Meanwhile, a coalition of more than 130 liberal organizations will hold a candlelight vigil at the National Mall starting at 4:45 p.m., and the right-wing Look Ahead America will hold a vigil outside the D.C. jail.Jessica Chasmar is a digital writer on the politics team for Fox News and Fox Business.

  "title": "Two questions from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot",
  "description": "There are two questions I still have a year after the riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
  "date": "January 5, 2022 7:37pm EST",
  "text": "'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host shows how the media uses history as a tool to distort the truthThose are the two questions I still have a year after the riot at the U.S. Capitol.I was on the air for more than 15 hours on January 6 and 7, 2021, holed up in the basement of the Capitol, during the insurrection. I actually didn\u2019t start my day on January 6 until about 1 pm \u2013 the time when the House and Senate convened a Joint Session of Congress to certify the Electoral College. I began later than usual because we expected Republican lawmakers to contest up to six states. The House and Senate are allowed to debate each state\u2019s slate of electors for two hours and then vote. So I thought the process may bleed well into January 7th if not January 8th.And therein lies the essence of my first question.How did the riot happen on January 6th of all days?The House and Senate only convene a Joint Session of Congress for two events: the President\u2019s State of the Union address and to certify the Electoral College.The Vice President and the Speaker of the House preside over this session. The Joint Session in January 2013, to certify the re-election of President Obama was a sleepy affair. No members challenged any state\u2019s electoral votes. Fewer than 80 members from either body came to the House chamber to watch 'tellers' (a group of House and Senate members) inspect the electoral votes and to hear then-Vice President Biden announce the results. In fact, many freshman members \u2013 on the job for just a few days \u2013 only swung by so they could meet the vice president or pose for a photograph.January 6, 2021, emerged as one of the most toxic, intense days ever seen at the historic U.S. Capitol.They never anticipated that a mob of Americans would descend on the Capitol and try to rip the place apart. Especially on a day as central to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power.I\u2019ve observed the fury and rage percolate for years now. Americans of both sides \u2013 or unaffiliated \u2013 rage at Washington. Some of it justified. Some of it not. Some of it uninformed. Some just hyperventilating. But to see a mob ransack the U.S. Capitol in the middle of one of the most crucial moments in American democracy is the antithesis of the entire exercise. I never thought I would witness fellow citizens storm America\u2019s citadel of democracy, break glass windows, assault police officers, defecate on the Milton tile floors of the Capitol and attempt to barge into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby with intent to do God knows what.Chilling doesn\u2019t do the scenario justice.It\u2019s one thing for a swarm of people to descend on Capitol Hill to protest. We\u2019ve seen that before. It\u2019s another thing to face a violent throng whipped into a fever like the one a year ago.There were challenges to electoral votes before. Democrats attempted to question the certification of electoral votes for President George W. Bush in both 2001 and 2005. The 2001 effort didn\u2019t get very far. The 2005 maneuver actually prompted a brief debate in the House and Senate over electors from Ohio.The Founders placed a ticking bomb inside the Constitution when it comes to the Electoral College. People don\u2019t elect the President. Electors who comprise the Electoral College do. There\u2019s a chasm for potential mischief between voters casting their ballots and the certification of a state\u2019s electoral votes in Congress. This is further enhanced by the Founders mandating that the House would pick the president if the Electoral College results weren\u2019t clear. Such 'contingent elections' presented the country with Presidents Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and John Quincy Adams in 1825.But back to January 6th last year.What took so long to quash the uprising?Practically every lawmaker, aide, reporter, and custodian always believed the Capitol was a fortress. Impenetrable. The building dodged disaster on 9/11. There are a lot of Capitol police officers. But there were nowhere near as many officers as were needed to repel a pulse of people surging toward the Capitol as there were on 1/6.Former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller told a House panel last year that if troops went to the Capitol, there were 'fears that the President would invoke the Insurrection Act to politicize the military in an anti-democratic manner.'In other words, Miller worried that former President Trump would convert those troops, trying to crush the mob, into a force which would declare him the winner. Miller told the House committee there was 'heightened commentary in the media about the possibility of a military coup or that advisors to the President were advocating the declaration of martial law.'It doesn\u2019t get much scarier than that.Unless you try to understand why it took Capitol Police tactical units more than 45 minutes to finally end a siege in the House chamber with thugs pounding on the doors.It took hours. And hours. And hours.These are the questions:Why did the riot happen on January 6 of all days?Why did the riot go on for so long?There only are partial answers to these questions a year later. But some of the answers only beg deeper questions.Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

  "description": "After ex-officials responsible for security at the Capitol on Jan. 6 testified before Congress Tuesday, the\u00a0police union representing the rank-and-file reacted to the leadership \"dysfunction\" on display at the hearing and demanded U.S. Capitol Police Acting Chief Pittman also submit her resignation, citing \"systemic failures\" and intelligence breakdowns that left about 140 officers injured.",

  "text": "FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'Special Report' with more from Senate hearingFormer U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, former Senate Sergeant of Arms Michael Stenger, former House Sergeant of Arms Paul Irving, and Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee testified before a joint Senate Rules and Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday aboutthe insurrection.'The root cause of the USCP\u2019s failure on January 6th was a failure of leadership. I think the Senators saw that dysfunction on display today,' Papathanasiou said. 'Instead of cohesive leadership, we heard Stenger, Irving and former Chief Sund give contradicting accounts about the department\u2019s handling of requests for backup from the National Guard. It\u2019s maddening.'During a line of questioning by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., Sund and Irving could not agree on when National Guard assistance was requested.Sund said he submitted the request at 1:09 p.m. on Jan. 6. But Irving insisted he did not receive the request for National Guard support until after 2 p.m. while in former Stenger\u2019s office. When pressed, Irving said he took a call from Sund beforehand while on the Congress floor but did not view the conversation as a formal request for National Guard support. Blunt ran out of time, and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who was tapped next to question witnesses, suggested that phone records be dug up in the future to clarify that timeline.Sund'admits that he did not see critical intelligence leading up to the insurrection. That intelligence should have been driving a more robust force posture,'Papathanasiou said.'Even after this hearing, we still don\u2019t know why rank-and-file officers were not fully briefed on the threats that our leadership already knew were looming.''This is a report that I am just learning about within the last, they informed me yesterday of the report,' Sund said. To that, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., asked, 'How can you not get that vital intelligence on the eve of what's going to be a major event?' Sund said the information was 'coming in as raw data' and admitted that it would have been helpful to have had the memo in advance.Papathanasiou said U.S. Capitol Police officers who responded to the insurrection 'paid a horrible price for our leadership\u2019s failures' and lost Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who the department said died from injuries sustained at the riot, as well Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood and Metropolitan PoliceOfficer Jeffrey Smith, who both 'have tragically taken their own lives.''We credit Stenger, Irving and Sund for having the decency to resign,' Papathanasiou said. 'However, Acting Chief Pittman and her entire leadership team must also be replaced.'The union recently held a vote of no confidence on the current leadership, and officers voted overwhelmingly that the U.S. Capitol Police needs new leaders. In Pittman\u2019s case, 92% of the officers voted against her continuing to be acting chief or chief.'The current leadership has lost the trust of the front-line officers. We know what these individuals failed to do prior to the insurrection, and we know what they failed to do during the insurrection,' Papathanasiou said. 'The trust they have lost, cannot be regained. If we are going to address the systemic failures that led to the security breach, we need new leaders. New leaders that will ensure we have the proper training and equipment needed.' 'Congress must find out the entirety of what went wrong and establish the steps needed to secure the Capitol complex,' the union leader continued, thanking Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Blunt andPeters for holding the joint hearing he hoped will be the first of many. 'The number of threats continues to rise, not decline. Members of Congress must be able to safely carry out the duties entrusted to them by the American people, no matter what threats they face.'Providing a first-hand account of police response to the U.S. Capitol, Capitol Police Capt. Carneysha Mendoza said at the hearing Tuesday that she suffered burns on her faceas officers inside the building on Jan. 6 were doused with gas sprayed by rioters. 'I proceeded to the Rotunda where I noticed a heavy smoke-like residue and smelled what I believed to be military-grade CS gas -- a familiar smell,' Mendoza, who served in the U.S. Army, said. 'It was mixed with fire extinguisher spray deployed by the rioters. The rioters continued to deploy CS inside the Rotunda.''Officers received a lot of gas exposure, which is a lot worse inside the building versus outside, because there's nowhere for it to go,' she continued.'I received chemical burns to my face that still have not healed to this day.'As Congress continues to seek clarity on the planning and events that unfolded in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police released a separate statement Tuesday to correct 'misinformation' in the media about the officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter, inside the Capitol building as rioters stormed the building.'As the investigation continues into the events of January 6, 2021, it\u2019s important to correct misinformation some in the media have reported, and that\u2019s been shared on social media,' the agency said in a press release. 'Reports identifying Special Agent David Bailey as the officer involved in the shooting in the Speaker\u2019s Lobby are inaccurate. The Department will share additional information once the investigation is complete.'Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

  "date": "April 19, 2021 5:34pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The medical examiner's report showed that Sicknick was sprayed with a chemical substance around 2:20 p.m. on Jan. 6 and collapsed at the Capitol around 10 p.m. that evening. He died around 9:30 p.m. on Jan. 7, according to the examiner's office.Diaz told the Washington Post, which first reported the news,that the Jan. 6 events 'played a role in his condition.'Federal officials arrested and chargedtwo men last month withassaulting Sicknick with bear spray during the riot. Julian Elie Khater, 32,of State College,Pennsylvania, and George Pierre Tanios, 39, of Morgantown, West Virginia,each faced an array of charges, including assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to injure an officer, although authoritiesstopped short of charging them with his death.Each assault chargecarries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Law enforcement officials initially said that Sicknick was struck by a fire extinguisher -- an idea perpetuated by The New York Times in a February report that wasquietly updated one month later. U.S. Capitol Police later said Sicknick had 'succumbed to his injuries' after defending the building, although questions lingered about the cause of death.Sicknick, who joined the force in 2008, 'was injured while physically engaging with protesters,' Capitol Police said. 'He returned to his division office and collapsed.He was taken to a local hospitalwhere he succumbed to his injuries.'Sicknickwas one of five people who died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, interrupting the electoral count that certified Joe Biden as the victor of the November election. About 140 officers were injured in the siege, according to the Capitol Police officers' union.At the beginning of February, theofficer was honored in the Capitol Rotunda, where President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were among those to pay their respects."

  "text": "Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports the latest on 'Hannity.' Through 814 pages, the committee members \u2014 seven Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 annotate interviews from more than 1,000 witnesses, information obtained from millions of pages of documents and the contents of 10 public hearings.The referrals include obstructing an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to defraud the federal government, making a false statement, and inciting, assisting, or aiding and comforting an insurrection.The committee\u2019s unprecedented criminal referral holds no official legal weight, and a final determination in whether to pursue the charges will be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department.The committee members include Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Reps. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.These are their findings:'The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack has succeeded in bringing clarity and demonstrating with painstaking detail the fragility of our Democracy,' she wrote. 'Above all, the work of the Select Committee underscores that our democratic institutions are only as strong as the commitment of those who are entrusted with their care.'In his own foreword, Chairman Thompson said those who broke into the Capitol 'came dangerously close to succeeding' if it were not for the efforts of law enforcement personnel who 'put their lives on the line for hours.''Every President in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one. January 6, 2021 was the first time one American President refused his Constitutional duty to transfer power peacefully to the next,' she wrote.She also wrote that some senior officials in the Trump administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, did not condone or cooperate with efforts to remain in power.'As you read this report, please consider this: Vice President Pence, along with many of the appointed officials who surrounded Donald Trump, worked to defeat many of the worst parts of Trump\u2019s plan to overturn the election. This was not a certainty,' Cheney said.The committee also recommended a revision to the Constitution, including a clause be added to the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent individuals identified in the report, namely Trump, from being able to hold office in the future.The report reads: 'Congressional committees of jurisdiction should consider creating a formal mechanism for evaluating whether to bar those individuals identified in this Report under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment from holding future federal or state office, The Committee believes that those who took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and then, on January 6th, engaged in insurrection can appropriately be disqualified and barred from holding government office\u2014whether federal or state, civilian or military\u2014absent at least two-thirds of Congress acting to remove the disability pursuant to Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.'Trump released a statement Thursday, following the report, saying it fails to draw attention to why the protesters were gathering in the first place. He also called it a 'Witch Hunt,' echoing his previous criticisms.Trump formally announced he would be seeking the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidency. He is currently ahead on early polling against other potential candidates, although Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is closing the gap."

  "text": "Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'Special Report' with the latest on what the American public can expect to find out about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on Thursday's primetime hearing. 'Ultimately, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, spurred a mob of domestic enemies..to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy,' Thompson said.Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., during her opening statement, said Americans Thursday evening would see 'never-before-seen footage of the brutal attack on our Capitol.''An attack that unfolded while a few blocks away, President Trump sat watching television in the dining room next to the Oval Office,' Cheney said. 'You will hear audio from the brave police officers battling for their lives and fighting to defend our democracy against a violent mob Donald Trump refused to call off.''There is no room for debate. Those who invaded our capital and battled law enforcement for hours were motivated by what President Trump had told them--that the election was stolen and that he was the rightful president,' Cheney said.Cheney added: 'President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.'The Select Committee is played a never-before-seen video of graphic events that transpired during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. Thompson, before playing the tape, warned that it 'is hard to watch.'Lawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee also presented videos of interviews and depositions with former top Trump officials before the select committee.During his opening statement, Thompson referred to former Attorney General Bill Barr's deposition before the committee.Barr said he had three discussions with Trump between Election Day 2020 and his early resignation from the Trump administration in December 2020.'I made it clear I did not agree with the idea that the election was stolen, which, I told the president, was bulls--t,' Barr said during his deposition. 'And you know, I didn't want to be a part of it, and that's one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when I did.'Barr added that: 'You can't live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election--that there was fraud in the election.'Cheney, one of only two Republican members on the committee, also played a clip from Barr's deposition during her opening statement, again undercutting Trump's claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen.Cheney presented video testimony from Ivanka Trump on Barr's statement that the Justice Department found 'no fraud sufficient to overturn the election.'During the video, Ivanka Trump was asked how Barr's statement affected her perspective of the election.'It affected my perspective,' she testified. 'I respect Attorney General Barr, so, I accepted what he was saying.'The committee also played video of the testimony of Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner. Both were members of the Trump administration.Meanwhile, Cheney said that there is 'no doubt that President Trump was well aware of the violence as it developed.''White House staff urged President Trump to intervene and call off the mob,' Cheney said, presenting a document written by a member of the White House staff 'advising what the president needed to say' while the attack was underway at the Capitol.'Anyone who entered the Capitol without proper authority should leave immediately,' the note Cheney presented read. 'This is exactly what his supporters on Capitol Hill and nationwide were urging the president to do. He would not.'Cheney also pointed to congressional leaders who 'begged' Trump for help, including Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who was ''scared' and called multiple members of President Trump's family after he could not persuade the president himself.''Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no call to any element of the United States government to instruct that the Capitol be defended,' Cheney said. 'Trump did not call his Secretary of Defense on January 6th. He did not talk to his attorney general. He did not talk to the Department of Homeland Security.''President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day, and he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and display and deploy law enforcement assets,' Cheney said.Cheney, though, said then-Vice President Mike Pence did contact the Pentagon for assets to protect the Capitol.Cheney played audio of testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who said Pence 'was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders--there was no question about that.'Milley said Pence urged then-Defense Secretary Christopher Miller to 'get military down here, get the guard down here, put down this situation.'In contrast, Milley shared details of his conversation with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.'He said, we have, we have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions,' Milley testified Meadows said. 'We need to establish the narrative that, you know, that the president is still in charge and that things are steady or stable.'Milley added: 'That's something-- I immediately interpret that as politics, politics, politics. Red flag for me personally.'The hearing will also feature testimony from two live witnesses \u2014 Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards and filmmaker Nick Quested.But a select committee aide said Wednesday the hearing in general will emphasize 'ongoing threats to our democracy' related to Trump and Jan. 6.'The vast majority of the material you will see \u2026 is previously unseen,' a select committee aide said Wednesday. 'Whether it is recording video or audio of witnesses we've interviewed, whether it is records that we've obtained over the course of our investigation.Republicans are largely not involved in the committee hearings, as just two sit on the panel: Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger.Republicans have also argued that the committee is ignoring the physical security of the Capitol to focus on the Trump-related storyline.'We should study the events that led up to it. Why the Capitol was left unsecured on Jan. 6 when there was intelligence dating back before Jan. 6 something was going to happen,' GOP Rep. Jim Banks said in an interview with Fox News Digital.But those supportive of the committee say it is taking Capitol security into account. It has a separate investigative team dedicated to security failures. Republicans are just using that point to deflect from Trump's false claims the election was stolen and alleged culpability in the attack, committee supporters say.Thursday's hearing is expected to be just one of several televised hearings from the Jan. 6 committee, with the next already announced for Monday and Wednesday next week.The committee is expected to use their series of hearings to attempt to capture Americans\u2019 attention before the November midterm elections\u2014as they compete with inflation, rising gas prices, shortages in baby formula and more for political attention.A select committee aide said the Thursday event will serve as an 'opening statement' to grab Americans' attention and to preview subsequent hearings.Thursday\u2019s hearing comes after months of interviews, depositions and the committee subpoenaing more than 1,000 people and gathering more than 140,000 documents.Former President Trump on Thursday, hours before the hearing, posted on his own TRUTH Social, slamming the 'corrupt politicians' on the panel, and blasting them as 'political thugs.'Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

That includes honoring U.S. Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, both of whom died in the days following the attack.A medical examiner found Sicknick died after suffering two strokes and that there was no evidence his death was caused by chemical irritants he was exposed to during the riot. Liebengood died by suicide just days after the riot, and his family said his death was caused by 'the trauma he experienced on the job.'The memorial would also honor Metropolitan Police Department Officers Jeffrey Smith, Gunther Hashida and Kyle DeFreytag. All three died by suicide after the riot.The bill makes no mention of Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who was shot by a Capitol Police officer during the riot, or three others who died during the event.Another sponsor of the bill, Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., said the bill honors those who protected American democracy, 'some of whom with their lives, and to ensure future generations never forget that our democracy is only as strong as our commitment to it.''For more than two centuries the United States exhibited one of the most crucial requirements of democracy \u2014 a peaceful transition of power,' she said. 'The insurrection of January 6th brought an end to that unbroken transition and must be remembered as a warning to Americans as to what happens when violent, anti-democratic rhetoric is given a platform.'Crow and Wild introduced the same bill in the last Congress, when Democrats controlled it.

USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,' the report said. 'One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap.

Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.'The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board\u2019s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,' the Senate report found.The committee released a 154-page executive summary of their findings on Monday and referred criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department.'What Donald Trump proceeded to do after the 2020 election is something no president had done before in our country,' said Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. 'In a staggering betrayal of his oath, Donald Trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy.'The panel argued during the committee's final meeting that Trump's conduct before and after Jan. 6 was 'unlawful.' Lawmakers say they have sufficient evidence that Trump obstructed an official proceeding of Congress, conspired to defraud the federal government, made a false statement, and incited, assisted or aided an insurrection.Over its 18-month tenure, the committee obtained access to tens of thousands of documents and conducted nearly 1,000 interviews related to the Capitol protests.Chris Pandolfo is a writer for Fox News Digital.

  "text": "Republican Study Committee chair tells 'The Story' why the American people have already dismissed the Capitol riot hearing.'First and foremost, the Capitol was not secure that day. There was a systemic breakdown of security and leadership within Capitol security; the top levels of the Capitol Police. When Pelosi kicked me and Jim Jordan off that committee and said we weren't allowed to serve on it, we still went to work,' he said on 'The Story.'Other members of the Jan. 6 committee include Reps. Elaine Luria of Virginia, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and Adam B. Schiff of California. Pelosi said Banks and Jordan would endanger the 'integrity' of the committee, adding she would only accept the GOP's other nominees: Reps. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Rodney Davis of Illinois and Troy Nehls of Texas.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded by pulling the entire slate, pledging not to participate in the 'sham process.'Banks said he and Jordan interviewed several Capitol law enforcement and determined 'serious issues' around security and intelligence gathering & dissemination.An official from the union representing Capitol Police disclosed there was no intelligence-sharing that may have better prepared officers for the chaos, Banks said.'They had faulty or outdated equipment. Some of them didn't even have riot shields or helmets on. The rioters had better equipment than they did,' he claimed. 'You haven't heard about these serious issues raised at all by this sham January 6 Committee.'The true intent of the Thompson-Cheney committee is to legally prevent their joint political nemesis, Donald Trump, from being able to run for office again, Banks said.Other conservatives have pointed to the frequent use of the term 'insurrection' as a potential means for Democrats to invoke the 14th Amendment to stymie Trump if they are able to link him to such a branding \u2013 as Section III therein bars those 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same' from federal or military office.Banks said the areas of his investigation are not helpful to the Jan. 6 committee's intended partisan ends.'[T]hat changes the narrative away from the political witch hunt going after Donald Trump and their narrative to try to abolish the Electoral College, prevent Donald Trump's name from ever being on the ballot again [and] to intimidate Donald Trump's former staffers,' he said.'That's what it's all about. It's not about the serious issues that would go a long way to securing our Capitol and preventing something like this from ever happening again.'Charles Creitz is a reporter forFox News Digital.He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.Charles covers media, politics and breaking news, and has covered the annual CPAC conference for Fox News Digital.Charles is a Pennsylvania native and graduated from Temple University with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism.

  "title": "How Wednesday's Capitol riot came to fruition and who made it happen",
  "description": "The congressional endeavor of certifying the Presidential winner in the\u00a0Electoral College\u00a0is typically a banal ritual. Only this year \u2013 following weeks of mounting emotions, filed lawsuits to overturn the results and insistence from\u00a0President Trump\u00a0and his supporters that the election was stolen \u2013 it became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by thousands storming the Capitol building, shots ringing out, tear gas deployed, and lives lost. So what happened? How did should a showdown come to be?",
  "date": "January 8, 2021 6:59pm EST",
  "text": "<br>So what happened?According to one U.S. military veteran heavily involved in the planning of Wednesday's protests, attendees came from across thecountry.'Whether it was Veterans for Trump or Bikers for Trump or Latinos for Trump, we were all there together. We came together by action and the call of our president,' the source, who spoke on background, told Fox News. 'Our commander-in-chief had requested our assistance, and any veteran with honor listens to the commander-in-chief. That is the spirit in which we live.'In the days leading up to Wednesday, Trump supporters started 'pouring in,' the source said.'Everything was booked; you couldn't get a room. People were camping out in the cold,' the organizer said, explaining that buses brought supporters from out-of-state. 'It was a call to action. We knew this was going to be a big day and an important point in time.'Jan. 6,the date for certification of the Electoral College, began with small crowds of Trump supporters filtering into designated areas around the Ellipse for permit-approved rallies.Around 10 a.m., in bone-chilling cold, Trump's sons and his longtime lawyer spoke to the growing crowds, and after the president's speech, in which he said he would never concede, thousands marched toward the Capitol after he suggested that they should.'We\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol and we\u2019re going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,' Trump said.Meanwhile, many more protesters accumulated by the White House lawn.Within another 40 minutes, the barricades ruptured and thousands headed into the chambers with anger, exhilaration, determinationand confusion. After the initial scuffle and breach,word spread quickly through social media forumsand scores followed each others'footsteps inside.From the one insider's point-of-view, the 'doors were already open to them, and the barricades had been pulled down already.' People simply 'wanted to be heard in the chambers,' they 'wanted their voices heard,' and were 'sick and tired of what had been going on.'Trump eventually urged backers to protest 'peacefully and patriotically,' but the chaos continued.But whether or not detailed plans to overrun the federal building had been set in motion earlier was subject to debate. One Washington security employee connected to the White House told Fox News that it's likely 95%of the attendees were there to protest non-violently. Still, there was likely a sub-section of attendees with more violent intentions.'Many of the attackers appeared dressed for a riot \u2013 suggesting some element of planning,'said Jordan Strauss, managing director ofbusiness intelligence and investigations atKroll, a division of New York-based risk consultancy Duff & Phelps.'But I suspect that it was a combination, with some individuals having announced themselves as having come to storm the Capitol or incite some sort of revolution. It would surprise me if some otherwise peaceful protesters were not swept up in the fever of the moment and decided to cross the threshold from peaceful protesters to criminals on the spot.'Nonetheless, the drawing in of MAGA devotees and Trump loyalists for the coveted date had long been in the works, mostly through Facebook pages and online groups \u2013 many of which are above-board, registered non-profit 501c3s.According to a number of those who attended Wednesday's events, the big push beganafter Trump tweeted on Dec. 19: 'Big protest in D.C. on January 6. Be there, be wild!''There's often little sophistication to how these events are planned,'said Ryan Schonfeld, founder & CEO, RAS Security Group.'The ability to respond in a coordinated manner is possible with the right combination of people and technology making sense of the available data. An exacerbating factor is misinformation, often spread through the use of fake social media and online accounts and profiles.'Momentum, augmented heavily by Trump's rhetoric, continued to gatheras the reckoning day to 'stop the steal' neared. Several already well-established contingencies supporting the president continued to encourage backers to show up, and new Facebook groups echoing the rallying cry surfaced. While less-regulated social media sites such as Gab and Parler have become common platforms for protest discussions, several of those involved told Fox News that most communication was not underground or via encryption, but open-source.'We augment and push out our events through social media messaging, and we have direct coordinators and influencers (with large followings) who help in letting our supporters know event times and locations,' the source continued. 'The point was to be there for the president. All of these patriot groups wanted to be there. We don't want to see the theft of America or a banana republic.'Last Friday, the first day of 2021, after a surprise early departure from his Florida's Mar-a-Lago residence before ringing in the New Year with his most ardent donors, Trump tweeted that the 'BIG Protest Rally' would begin at 11 a.m. on Jan. 6.But how and why the Capitol was so easily breached remains a sore point many security experts are piecing together. Officials have contended that despite weeks of planning between federal and local law enforcement agencies, which also entailed social media monitoring, there was no intelligence to indicate the historic chaos.The 'lack of intel' linesparked further conspiracies by those at the rally.Some involved in Wednesday's breach still maintain that it was never their intention --and rather, that anti-Trump agitators initiated it.Another pro-Trump activist vowed that there were 'different anarchists involved,' some of whom took advantage of 'trying to get patriotic, emotionally charged people to do something stupid' --like following the leader into the Capitol.Nonetheless, the whole episode shookthe Washington security apparatus to the core.Spending on the police forceincreased from $115 million in 2000 to an estimated $516 million for 2021,he said.And yet, for many Americans who still stand by the unfounded notion of a fraudulent 2020 election, in the aftermath of Wednesday's bloodshed and with Biden's inauguration just 12 days away,they are still firmly committed to the pro-Trump cause.One on-the-ground, pro-Trump leader who is in the process of gathering video and content to dispel the 'false narratives that (they) are the terrorists or insurgents.''People were being funneled into one direction; how do we know it wasn't a deliberate tactic to target us?' the supporter said. 'An unarmed combat veteran was shot. Police could have easily used a non-lethal tactic. 'We will always honor our fallen, and we are not going to go away. We want to follow our commander-in-chief, and we are watching and waiting for his next action.'"

  "text": "Attorneys representing Samsel, Steven Metcalf and Elisabeth Pasqualini, did not return voicemails left byFox News on Wednesday.According to Metcalf, Samsel was moved to another cell that evening and by midnight two guards arrived, tied his arms behind his back with zip-tie handcuffs and 'beat him to a bloody pulp.'The lawyer said his client has since suffered seizures for the first time in his life. The attack allegedly left him with a broken nose, dislocated jaw and damaged vision in one eye.When he saw his client for the first time over video two weeks after the incident, Metcalf said Samsel\u2019s face was still black and blue and the skin around his wrists stripped off.'I have seen Ryan. He has two black eyes to this day, two weeks later. All the skin is ripped off both wrists, which shows the zip ties and how tight they were,' Metcalf said in a separate interview with Politico. 'Other inmates said his face looked like a tomato that was stomped on.''We intend on filing a lawsuit against the two specific guards and the facility responsible for this scenario because Ryan Samsel did not deserve to get targeted and treated like this,' Metcalf added.Pasqualini told Politico that Samsel had been moved to an 'undisclosed location' early Tuesday and the incident when he was allegedly attacked by DC guards is under investigation by the FBI. The attorney said she learned about the incident from lawyers representing other defendants held at the jail.The D.C. Department of Corrections said in a statement that the facility 'takes the safety and well-being of all residents, staff, and contractors extremely seriously. We are aware of the allegation made by an inmate and it is under investigation by the Department of Justice.'During the hearing Tuesday, the judge made no direct response to the allegations made by Sandlin regarding Samsel and Barnett. But Friedrich did schedule another hearing for Thursday to discuss Sandlin\u2019s potential pre-trial release.Prosecutors on Tuesday objected to Sandlin\u2019s pre-trial release and told the court he had been in contact with 'famed documentarian' Dinesh D'Souza.'It would not surprise me at all if he absconded and tried to paint himself as the Edward Snowden of the Capitol riot,' a prosecutor reportedly said in court.Sandlin also reportedly described what he categorized as racial tension between minority guards and the largely White suspects held at the jail, given that some suspects have been accused of belonging to White supremacist groups. Sandlin told the judge one guard declared, 'I hate all White people and your honky religion,' according to Politico.Samsel allegedly picked the officer up, telling her, 'We don\u2019t have to hurt you, why are you standing in our way?' The officer appeared semiconscious and left but collapsed later that day while arresting a different rioter, court documents allege.Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

  "text": "Half of the Chicago Police Department could face unpaid leave amid the coronavirus vaccine mandate; Mike Tobin reports on the latest. He is due to appear in federal court in Washington later Friday.Riley, who responded to a report of a pipe bomb on Jan. 6 and has been a Capitol Police officer for about 25 years, had sent the person a message telling them that he was an officer with the police force who 'agrees with your political stance,' an indictment against him says.The indictment spells out how Riley sent dozens of messages to the unidentified person, encouraging them to remove incriminating photos and videos and telling them how the FBI was investigating to identify rioters.It wasn't clear if he had an attorney who could comment on the charges against him. A call to the U.S. Capitol Police wasn't immediately returned.His arrest and the accusation that an active duty Capitol Police officer was trying to obstruct the investigation into the attack is particularly notable because many of his colleagues were brutally beaten in the insurrection. The riot left dozens of police officers bloodied and bruised as the crowd of pro-Trump rioters, some armed with pipes, bats and bear spray, charged into the Capitol, quickly overrunning the overwhelmed police force.One officer was beaten and shocked with a stun gun repeatedly until he had a heart attack; another was foaming at the mouth and screaming for help as rioters crushed him between two doors and bashed him in the head with his own weapon.More than 600 people face charges in the Jan. 6 attack, in which a mob loyal to then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, battled police and tried to stop the certification of the election victory for President Joe Biden.Experts say the efforts to scrub the social media accounts reveal a desperate willingness to manipulate evidence once these people realized they were in hot water. They say it can serve as powerful proof of people\u2019s consciousness of guilt and can make it harder to negotiate plea deals and seek leniency at sentencing.Riley told the rioter that the scene was a 'total s---show.' 'I\u2019m glad you got out of there unscathed. We had over 50 officers hurt, some pretty bad,' the officer wrote, according to the complaint.When the rioter said through messaging that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d done anything wrong, Riley responded, according to court papers: 'The only thing I can see is if you went into the building and they have proof you will be charged. You could always articulate that you had nowhere to go, but that\u2019s for court.'Later in January, after two had discussed their love of fishing, Riley told the man to get off social media.'They\u2019re arresting dozens of people a day,' he wrote, according to the posting. 'Everyone that was in the building. Engaged in violent acts or destruction of property and they\u2019re all being charged federally with felonies.'Making digital content vanish isn\u2019t as easy as deleting content from phones, removing social media posts or shutting down accounts. Investigators have been able to retrieve the digital content by requesting it from social media companies, even after accounts are shut down. Posts made on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms are recoverable for a certain period of time, and authorities routinely ask those companies to preserve the records until they get court orders to view the posts.Despite initial criticism that Capitol police did not do enough to stop the rioters, Riley is the first Capitol police officer to be charged with a crime involving the insurrection.But several current and former police officers were arrested on riot-related charges, including two Virginia police officers who posed for a photo during the attack. In July, authorities arrested an off-duty Drug Enforcement Administration agent accused of posing for photographs in which he flashed his DEA badge and firearm outside the Capitol during the riot.Other law enforcement officers were investigated for their presence at the Capitol that day or at Trump\u2019s rally before the riot. In January, an Associated Press survey of law enforcement agencies nationwide found that at least 31 officers in 12 states are being scrutinized by their supervisors for their behavior in the District of Columbia or face criminal charges for participating in the riot.It isn't clear whether Riley was among the officers who were referred for disciplinary action."

  "description": "One of the most malevolent, toxic moments in American history unfolded at the Capitol this week.",
  "date": "January 8, 2021 11:20pm EST",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The U.S. Capitol is that. But it\u2019s also an office building. A museum. An art gallery. And, the U.S. Capitol is the temple where American history plays out.It all unfolds under the Capitol Dome. Machinations in the building are synthesized with what the rest of the country is going through at any given moment.Debates and legislation about slavery. The first 'shot' fired in the Civil War came in the Old Senate chamber as Rep. Preston Brooks, D-S.C., nearly beat to death Sen. Charles Sumner, R-Mass., with a cane. The building has seen imbroglios over ObamaCare. Arguments about firearms. The Dred Scott and Amistad decisions unfolded in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. Votes to send men and women to war are cast in the U.S. Capitol. We inaugurate American presidents on the West Front the U.S. Capitol. And they later lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. The House and Senate chambers are no different than Walmart when it comes to donnybrooks about wearing masks during a pandemic. The House and Senate argued about civil rights during the 1960s. Contemporary debates about 'Black Lives Matter' and police reform resonated in the chamber after police killings last spring and summer. And then the body of the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., lay in state within the Capitol walls. As such, one of the most malevolent, toxic moments in American history unfolded at the Capitol. It\u2019s forever stamped as a shameful date: Jan. 6, 2021. Marauders roamed the Capitol. Trashed the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s Office. Wielded Confederate flags in the Ohio Clock Corridor outside the Senate chamber. Ripped down the nameplate to the entrance of the office suite of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Vandalized a statue of President Zachary Taylor. Carved 'Murder the Media' in a Capitol doorway. Extremists defecated in the hallways, stomped in their own feces and tracked their excrement across the encaustic, Minton tiles.Jan.6, 2021, would have been historic enough on its own.Puerto Rican nationalists shot up the House chamber in 1954, wounding five Congress members. The 'fourth' plane that hijackers commandeered and crashed in Pennsylvania was headed to the Capitol on 9/11. But the U.S. Capitol hadn\u2019t faced an incursion like the one it encountered Wednesday since the British stormed the building 207 years ago.The British routed American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg on Aug. 24, 1814, as a part of the 'Chesapeake Campaign.' Having quashed the fledgling U.S. military in Maryland just outside Washington, the Royal Marines marched 10 miles to the east. They sacked the Capitol and set the structure ablaze.The inferno marked the only time since the Revolutionary War that the Capitol fell to a foreign raider.A foreign adversary didn\u2019t invade the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But this date is now entered into the almanac of ignominy. A macabre shorthand which speaks in shorthand: Sept.11, 2001 and Dec. 7, 1941. But this time, the threat didn\u2019t come from external foes. Senate Chaplain Barry Black addressed this menace in his closing prayer when the joint session of Congress finalized the Electoral College outcome just before 4 a.m. ETon Jan. 7.And they damn near lost the building.This isn\u2019t about a 'building.' This is about American democracy. And if they 'lost the building' Wednesday, the United States of America would have lost much more.Capitol security failed. But would the institutions of American democracy falter as well? Authorities are now rounding up some of the hoodlums and arresting them. When they came to the Capitol, one was in possession of explosives. Another toted Molotov cocktails. Another wielded an M4 carbine. Some had multiple handguns. Another thug brought 'homemade napalm.'The continuity of American government teetered on a narrow ledge Wednesday. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much for democracy to plunge into a crevasse of catastrophe.As I say, American history plays out under the Capitol Dome. All of this, as lawmakers convened a joint session of Congress with the speaker of the House and vice president of the United States presiding. 'They could have killed us all,' fumed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. 'How could they(U.S. Capitol Police) have failed so miserably, 20 years after 9/11? They could have blown the building up.'We came damn close to losing it all on Jan. 6. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned to 'watch' things on Capitol Hill. Observing, so as to divine meaning and decode various happenings.I frequently watch the floor directors for the speaker and majority leader in the House chamber. The floor director serves as a parliamentary sentinel for trouble. If the floor director is worked up, it\u2019s a good bet something bad is going down. An amendment may be about to fail. A member voted differently than was expected. There\u2019s an unanticipated problem with a bill. They may lack the votes to pass legislation.In the House, I train my eyes on Keith Stern, Pelosi\u2019s floor director.I was downstairs in the Capitol Visitor\u2019s Center in an auxiliary studio Fox News uses during the pandemic to cover the Electoral College certification. One of my earpieces was jacked into Fox\u2019s New York City and Washington studios. The other earpiece was wired so I could listen to either the House or Senate floors. We set up two monitors so I could observe happenings in both the House and Senate chambers.Not long after 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, I reported that there was a security threat inside the Capitol. I saw Stern running on my monitor as the House attempted to debate Arizona\u2019s slate of electoral votes. Stern\u2019s panic spelled a problem. A couple of moments later, the House abruptly recessed. But I could still hear the House floor audio in my earpiece. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., presided over the session. Years ago, congressional security officials told me of a battle plan during a hypothetical terrorist threat during State of the Union. They would likely cut the TV feed so officials could instruct those in the chamber on what to do. Seconds later, McGovern warned lawmakers and aides to get down under their desks. The Massachusetts Democrat instructed them to grab escape hoods stowed under chairs in the chamber. I couldn\u2019t hear the pandemonium from the House chamber unfolding three floors above me. But it wasn\u2019t long until I was told by multiple sources there was gunfire in the Capitol. I used caution. Misinformation is a lava flow during a crisis. Hot. Fast. And dangerous. I finally confirmed that there was gunfire in the Capitol. But I wouldn\u2019t see video of what transpired until a few hours later.A clutch of demonstrators raised hell at the glass doors atop a staircase leading to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby. The Speaker\u2019s Lobby is a long, ornate hallway stretching immediately behind the House chamber. The thugs kicked at the doors to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, stabbing at it with the butt end of poles festooned with Trump flags. They shouted 'Break it down!' and 'F--- the police!' The hooligans were getting close. If the mob broke into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, they were all but inside the House chamber.A secondary door leading to the chamber is immediately inside the Lobby. Security officials shoved stacks of furniture against the doors to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby to prevent the invaders from breaking inside. Then, a plainclothes U.S Capitol Police officer appeared inside the doorway to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, service weapon drawn. A woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt of California then allegedly tried to scale the doorway and vault over the transom of the Speaker\u2019s Lobby. Holding his weapon steady, the officer fired a single shot.It killed Babbitt. In normal, pre-pandemic times, I spend hours in the Speaker\u2019s Lobby. It\u2019s where most reporters go to talk to lawmakers and aides when votes are called in the House. The Speaker\u2019s Lobby hasn\u2019t been open since March due to the pandemic. But the video from Wednesday shows the mutineers were close to busting down the doors before the officer discharged his weapon. I will return to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby through those very doors when coronavirus subsides. But this grotesque episode forever alters that hallowed venue in America\u2019s seat of government. American history plays out under the Capitol Dome. An icon to that history is situated above the main entrance to Statuary Hall, the old House chamber. Perched immediately above the passageway to the Capitol Rotunda is a statue of Clio, the 'Muse of History.' Clio stands atop a chariot, a clock doubling as a wheel. Clio gazes down on the old House chamber, recording events which unfold in the Capitol below. Many of the raiders who rushed the Capitol passed right under Clio as they traipsed between the Rotunda and the House chamber, skirmishing with the Capitol Police. American history plays out under the Capitol Dome. They damn near lost the building.Clio witnessed it all.The events of Jan. 6, 2021 are now etched into Clio\u2019s tablet. The darkest entry yet.Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined the network in September 2007 and is based out of Washington, D.C."

The two officers were found to have crossed the outdoor barriers established by the CapitolPolice\u202fand were directly next to the Capitol Building,' Diaz said in a statement posted to the Seattle police news blotter. 'Clear evidence places them directly next to the Capitol Building.\u202fItis beyond absurd to suggest that they did not knowthey were in an area where they should not be, amidst what was already a violent, criminal riot.'In the disciplinary reports, Diaz wrote the officers stood in the 'midst of an attempted insurrection' and possibly downplayed their actions that day.'A central function of a law enforcement officer is to uphold the law and keep the peace and your actions fell far short of that,' both reports said.The termination is in line with the July recommendation issued by the Office of Police Accountability, a civilian group that acts as a review board over the Seattle Police Department.'In granting the police the power and responsibility to do their work, the community takes as collateral an expectation that law enforcement will at all times earn and abide by that trust.,' Diaz said Friday. 'This is what should be expected\u202fof policing, and it is what I demand as Chief. It is also what Seattle Police officers expect of their colleagues, since these two officers\u2019 actions in D.C. that day were first brought to our attention by fellow officers.\u202f'Mike Solan, the president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, told Fox News the case against the officers was 'ensconced in politics.''I believe that the case file in and of itself has glaring holes in it,' Solan said, noting the officers said they had left the area near the riot without witnessing any wrongdoing. 'I believe just after 2 p.m., that's when a lot of the criminality was occurring inside the Capitol. There was really nothing occurring outside in terms of criminality or law enforcement officers being assaulted.'The officers said they stayed on grass 30 to 50 yards away from the capitol building and never saw any signs of a disturbance, according to an OPA report.As of Friday, the police union has not received an inquiry from the officers about possibly appealing the terminations, Solan said.The pair was two of six off-duty Seattle police officers who attended then-President Donald Trump's 'Stop the Steal' rally that preceded the chaos.Their trip became public after Caitlin Everett posted a photo on Facebook of her and Alexander Everett at the demonstration. Four other officers later admitted they were also there but said they were not involved in the riot.Diaz said the Everetts' presence there was unacceptable: 'More than a hundred officers sustained serious injuries \u2013 some career-ending \u2013 through outright assault,'"

A Democratic-led committee argues this is obstructionism and that nothing could be more important than investigating an attack on American democracy.",

  "text": "MediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz discusses President Biden's stance on DOJ prosecutions of former Trump officialsThat was then.Trump, obviously, has been leading the effort at revisionist history battle. So it\u2019s easy to ascribe the current stance of many Republican politicians as just not wanting the cross the party\u2019s de facto leader and possible 2024 nominee. But what\u2019s happening is deeper than that, underlining the two clashing realities that dominate American politics today.The belief that Jan. 6 was a righteous cause that somehow went awry requires an equally strong belief that the 2020 election was in fact stolen from Trump\u2014as he argues virtually every day, despite the investigations and lawsuits to the contrary. More than half the country, and the vast majority of the media, see that as ridiculous, but polls indicate that for many Republicans it has become an article of faith.The Atlantic likens Trump\u2019s crusade to the Confederacy, which of course mounted an armed rebellion against the United States largely to uphold the evils of slavery. And yet the politicians and generals who led that effort in secession have been venerated in the South for generations\u2014until recent years, when the tide shifted and the statues started to come down.'The New Lost Cause, like the old one, seeks to convert a shameful catastrophe into a celebration of the valor and honor of the culprits and portray those who attacked the country as the true patriots,' the piece says. 'But lost causes have a pernicious tendency to be less lost than we might hope. Just as neo-Confederate revisionism shaped racial violence and oppression after the war, Trump\u2019s New Lost Cause poses a continuing peril to the hope of \u2018one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u2019'Author David Graham allows that it was awful for Ashli Babbitt to have been fatally shot by a police officer as she tried to break into the House chamber. Trump has been celebrating her and recently mentioned her birthday.But while lost causes may have their martyrs, says the magazine, ticking off historical examples, the problem is that 'they emphasize the valor of the people involved while whitewashing what they were doing.' The soldiers of the Confederacy 'might well have been brave, and they might well have been good fathers, brothers, and sons, but they died in service of a treasonous war to preserve the institution of slavery, and that is why their actions do not deserve celebration. The January 6 insurrection was an attempt to subvert the Constitution and steal an election.'Politico examines the situation more at the ground-game level. Weeks after the riot, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ran digital ads in three states with this narration of the images of destruction: 'Republican legislators fanned the flames. Some were even there.''His street cred went up,' the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader admitted. 'There\u2019s no question.'The DLCC went after 21 lawmakers who were either at the Trump rally or with the Capitol protesters, and 600 others who signed letters or otherwise promoted 'Stop the Steal' rhetoric. But the Democratic group misread the mood of the GOP:'Rather than shaming Republican state lawmakers out of office, Democrats found that many of the names on the list avoided pushback from party leaders in their state, grew their political platform and online following, and in at least three cases are now running for statewide office.'History, it is said, is written by the winners. But in this case, those who lost the campaign to overturn the election, and have minimized Jan. 6, have convinced a whole lot of Americans of their version."

  "date": "January 6, 2022 12:10pm EST",
  "text": "Fox News anchor Bret Baier reacts to the tone of the president's speech marking one year since the Capitol riot.'Our Constitution faced the gravest of threats,' Biden said. 'Outnumbered in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police, the National Guard and brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.''Our democracy held. We the people endured. We the people prevailed,' Biden said.Biden, quickly, shifted to Trump \u2013 never mentioning him by name, but instead, referring to him only as 'the former president.''For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election. He tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol,' Biden said. 'But they failed.'Biden added that Americans 'must make sure this never, never happens again.'Biden pointed to Clio, the statue of the Muse of History, which overlooks Statuary Hall, noting that she documents the events of congressional history in the journal she holds.'Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place \u2013 the real history, the real facts, the real truth,' Biden said. 'The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.''Well here is the God's truth of Jan. 6, 2021,' Biden continued. 'Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving, for the first time inside the Capitol, Confederate flags that symbolize the cause to destroy America \u2013 to rip us apart. Even during the Civil War, that never happened. But it happened here, in 2021.''A mob, breaking windows, kicking in doors,' Biden continued, recalling individuals using 'American flags on poles' as 'weapons, as spears.'But Biden went on to invoke Trump again \u2013 noting that he 'had just rallied the mob to attack,' and watched the riot on television, and did 'nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives were at risk, the nation's Capitol under siege.'Biden said the rioters were 'not looking to uphold the will of the people,' but instead, 'looking to deny the will of the people,' and 'overturn' a 'free and fair election.'The president noted that his speech Thursday was 'about making sure the past isn\u2019t buried.'Pointing again to Trump, Biden said he 'created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.''He has done so because he values power over principle; he sees his own interest as more important than America\u2019s interest; his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,' Biden said.'He can\u2019t accept he lost, even though that\u2019s what 93 U.S. senators, his own attorney general, his own vice president, governors, state officials in every battleground state, have all said. He lost,' Biden said.'He has done what no president in the history of this country has ever done. He refused to accept results of an election and the will of the American people,' Biden said.Pointing to members of the Republican Party who are loyal to Trump, Biden said 'they seem to no longer want to be the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan or the Bushes.'Biden claimed that some Republicans are working with Trump to continue to tell 'the Big Lie, and claimed that they 'fear his wrath.''The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Nov. 3, 2020,' Biden said. 'They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection.'He added: 'Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at America? I cannot.''At this moment, we must decide what kind of nation are we going to be?' Biden declared. 'Will we be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation wherewe allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?'Biden went on to slam new election laws in Republican-led states across the nation \u2013 but did not name the states to which he was referring.'The only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' Biden said. 'It is wrong. It is undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.'Again defending the results of the 2020 presidential election, Biden said that 'no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized.''Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country was made and was rejected,' Biden said, noting that, often times, Republican-appointed judges rejected the challenges.Biden went on to claim that 'even before the first ballot was cast,' Trump 'was preemptively sowing lies about the vote,' saying they were not 'based on facts,' but instead was Trump\u2019s effort to look 'for a pre-text to cover for the truth.''He is not just a former president. He is a defeated president,' Biden said.'You can\u2019t love your country only when you win. You can\u2019t obey the law only when it is convenient. You can\u2019t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies,' Biden said. 'Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy.'Biden, shifting back to insurrectionists, said they 'didn\u2019t come here out of patriotism or principle.''They came here in rage. Not in service of America, but rather, in service of one man,' Biden said. 'Those who incited the mob, the real plotters who were desperate to deny the certification of this election, defied the will of the voters. But their plot was foiled.'He added: 'Congress finished the work, honored their oath to defend the Constitution, against all enemies \u2013 foreign and domestic.'Looking ahead, Biden said the United States is 'at an inflection point in history both at home and abroad,' warning that America is 'engaged in a new struggle between democracy and autocracy.'The president said that 'from China, Russia and beyond, they are betting that democracy\u2019s days are numbered' and that America 'will become more like them and less like us.''They are betting that America is the place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman,' Biden said. 'I do not believe that. That is not who we are, that is not who we have ever been, and that is not who we will ever, ever be.'The president said he is 'crystal clear' about the 'threats' America faces, urging Americans to 'step up' and 'write the next chapter in American history where Jan. 6 marked not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.''I believe the power of the presidency and purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it. To lift us up, not tear us apart,' Biden said at the close of his remarks.'To make it about us. Not about me.'Biden urged Americans to 'remember together that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, and that today and tomorrow and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.'Days after the riot in January 2021, the House of Representatives introduced an Article of Impeachment against Trump saying he 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.'The article alleged that before Jan. 6, the joint session of Congress to certify the presidential election results, Trump 'repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.'The article claimed that before the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, the president addressed a crowd and reiterated 'false claims,' claiming that his remarks 'encouraged--and forseeably resulted in--lawless action at the Capitol.'The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13, 2021, to impeach Trump. The Senate, in February 2021, voted in favor of his acquittal.Trump was the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, and the first president out of office to go through an impeachment proceeding.Meanwhile, in a statement shortly after Biden concluded his remarks Thursday, Trump slammed Biden saying he is 'working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more.''Everything he touches turns to failure,' Trump said, repeating his unproven claims that the election was 'rigged.'Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

  "text": "\u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 host examines the left\u2019s \u2018repulsive\u2019 rhetoric covering the events on Jan. 6 one year later.Yeah. January 6th, it's one of those indelible moments, one of those moments you can't forget, like the birth of your first child, the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, you've got to ask yourself, where were you when CNN claimed for the very first time that our democracy was under assault? Chances are you're probably standing at an airport waiting to get on the plane and wishing to God someone would turn the sound down on the TV set bolted to the ceiling. Because it's absurd, and so is what Harris said\u2014it's ridiculous. In fact, it's so ridiculous, we're not even going to bother to deconstruct it once again or attempt to refute it. It's self-discrediting as if Kamala Harris could be further discredited.We're in a kind of civil war. But more specifically, we await the ADL's furious statement condemning Doug Brinkley for trivializing genocide, which he just did. We'll let you know when we get that statement. In the meantime, Doug Brinkley was right about one thing. There are an awful lot of images showing what happened inside the Capitol on January 6th. We don't have to guess for the most part. I want to show one of them tonight because it's frankly representative. Here's the terrifying scene on the floor of the United States Senate as insurrectionists swept in.There is also film of what you saw if you were watching the coverage live that day. If you're watching January 6th unfold in real-time and you were probably like most people, no matter who you voted for, kind of shocked by it. Really, people swarming around the Capitol? That's not good. But then you saw something pretty strange, you saw the police who were in charge of securing the perimeter, move aside the barricades and let the protesters or rioters or insurrectionists whatever you\u2019re going to call them\u2014a lot of people still in prison\u2014let them in the building. So why did they do that?There's a man called Ray Epps, who was a longtime conservative activist. He was captured on camera at least three times, possibly more encouraging people on January 6th and the day before\u2014January 6th Eve, January 5th\u2014encouraging protesters to storm the Capitol.So there he is, scaffold commander, commanding the crowd to break the law, exhorting them forward to break the law. There was the largest manhunt in American history conducted after this day, January 6th. We're still talking about it, as noted a year later. And yet this guy is not only unidentified, no new authority seems interested in the slightest and finding out who he is and why is that?"

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.'I do not believe the additional, extraneous \u2018commission\u2019 that Democratic leaders want would uncover crucial new facts or promote healing,' McConnell said Thursday. 'Frankly, I do not believe it is even designed to.'The GOP filibuster Friday on the Jan. 6 commission Friday means the legislation is likely dead for now. But its failure will be sure to intensify pressure on Democrats to abolish the legislative filibuster altogether and just require a simple majority vote to advance future legislation.On Jan. 6, hundreds stormed the Capitol seeking to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Biden's Electoral College win. They violently overtook police officers, destroyed Capitol property and called for the killing of then-Vice President Mike Pence.The mob briefly stopped the certification process in Congress as lawmakers had to evacuate the chambers and take cover. In the end, 140 police officers were injured and five people died, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who suffered a stroke after the attack.More than 400 people have been charged criminally in the Jan. 6 riot.Sicknick's mother, Gladys Sicknick, visited GOP senators Thursday to personally urge them to support an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the origins of the attack, saying, 'I just couldn't stay quiet anymore.'But politics were strong at play, as Trump still has a big grip on the GOP and Republicans believe moving past the attack is important to their chances of winning the 2022 midterm elections.Afterward, Schumer said Republicans sealed their fate with Trump.'This vote has made it official: Donald Trump\u2019s big lie has now fully enveloped the Republican Party,' Schumer said. 'Donald Trump\u2019s big lie is now the defining principle of what was once the party of Lincoln.'Under the proposal passed by the House, the Jan. 6 panel would be a 10-person bipartisan commission. Half of the commissioners would be appointed by Democrats and the other half would be appointed by Republicans. The commission would have subpoena power to carry out the investigation, but there must be bipartisan agreement on issuing the subpoenas.The commission would have to issue a final report by Dec. 31, 2021.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., slammed the GOP filibuster, especially since Democrats worked across the aisle and agreed 'to everything that Republicans asked for' to make the panel bipartisan. She accused Republicans of putting election concerns above the security of Congress and the country.'Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans\u2019 denial of the truth of the January 6th insurrection brings shame to the Senate,' Pelosi said. 'Republicans\u2019 cowardice in rejecting the truth of that dark day makes our Capitol and our country less safe.'"

  "date": "January 6, 2023 10:33pm EST",
  "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson reflects on the January 6 Capitol breach two years later on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Under normal circumstances, Byrd would have been fired immediately and charged with murder, which he clearly committed, but that's not what happened. After doing essentially no investigation into the shooting, Nancy Pelosi's congressional police force declared Byrd a national hero and the media strongly agreed. Byrd went on television to accept accolades and to complain about racism. He was never punished for killing Ashli Babbitt. He was rewarded for it. Ashli Babbitt 's mother, meanwhile, got a very different sort of treatment. Babbitt's mother was arrested today in Washington by the Capitol Police. Her crime? Trying to hold a memorial service for her daughter.On the basis of a wholly created myth about what happened that day, the Biden Pentagon conducted an unprecedented political purge of the entire U.S. military. The FBI and various intel agencies increased their control over the American media and most obviously, the DOJ has been allowed to prosecute and jail hundreds of nonviolent political protesters whose crime was having the wrong opinions. Lies about January 6, which have been relentless, have enabled some of the most unscrupulous people in our country to make a mockery of our Bill of Rights and to steal our core freedoms.So they can't talk about Ashli Babbitt. Talking about Ashli Babbitt makes it very clear who the real culprits are and who the real threats to this country continue to be and they're not the January 6 protesters. So instead, they lie about what happened that day and they do it in the boldest possible ways, without shame and with maximum aggression. Here's Hakeem Jeffries, leader of the Democrats in the House, telling you that five police officers were killed on January 6, when in fact, the real total is zero. Five heroic officers were lost, he said. It's almost impossible to believe that adults could stand behind him as he said that because everyone in the picture you just saw knows that is not true. It's not a stilted interpretation of events. It's a flat out lie. No police officers were killed on January 6. Period. Ashli Babbitt was killed on January 6, but chances are our grandchildren will not know that because history will likely record the lie you just heard as true simply because it's been repeated so often. Everyone in authority has said the same thing in unison for two solid years. As our thoroughly dishonest Attorney General recently put it 'we will never forget the five officers who responded selflessly on January 6 and who have since lost their lives.' His boss, Joe Biden, repeated that lie today from the White House. 'That's historical fact,' says Joe Biden as he manufactures history, as he tells lies. They've been doing this, telling these same lies since the very first day, January 6, 2021, almost like it was a coordinated operation. Remember when they told you that Brian Sicknick, Officer Brian Sicknick, was beaten to death with a fire extinguisher? That's not true and in the end, thanks to the medical examiner in the District of Columbia, we learned the fact, which is that Brian Sicknick died of a stroke well after the January 6 protests. He was not beaten to death with a fire extinguisher, but that did not stop their lying or even slow them down.Joe Biden just awarded one of this country's highest civilian honors, the Presidential Citizen's Medal, to officers working on January 6 and that would include the officers who opened the doors of the Capitol building to the so-called insurrectionists, the officers who let them inside and then were rewarded for it by the president of the United States. 'What's going on here? ' You may wonder. Well, don't ask. You're not allowed to know what's going on here, nor can you know about the very obvious clandestine role of federal agencies that encouraged the events of January 6. That happened, but its details have never been explained. A lot has still not been explained from that day, despite a committee that was impaneled for more than a year.For example, you remember the pipe bomber who planted explosives outside the Democratic National Committee? Well, those explosives, it turns out, were under a bench at the same moment that Kamala Harris, who had Secret Service protection with her, who swept the building, was there. So, how did the U.S. Secret Service miss a bomb sitting in plain sight during its security sweep? Well, we can't answer that because the FBI still to this day refuses to release all the security footage.Why? What's going on here? Almost unique among media outlets, Revolver News asked that question. So, somebody planted bombs outside the headquarters of this country's two main political parties. That would seem to be a big story, and yet no one ever mentions it again, including the FBI. In fact, the Bureau won't disclose any information about the suspect, not his height, weight, shoe size, anything. So, if they wanted to catch this person, wouldn't they be telling you all they can about who it is? But they're not. Why aren't they and what was Kamala Harris doing there? Why did she lie about being there? We can\u2019t answer those questions. We should be able to.Nor does anyone in authority want to talk about Ray Epps. Ray Epps, is of course, is the man who was caught on tape encouraging the crowd outside the Capitol, both on January 5 and 6, to commit felonies by rushing inside. Now, what's interesting is that the January 6 Committee, under public pressure, did in the end interview Ray Epps. Now, we don't have all of the committee's records about that interview. We should, but we don't. But some have been released and what they tell is a remarkable story.In the testimony that we have, the committee coaches Ray Epps on how to answer questions about his involvement. 'I was in the front with a few others. I also orchestrated it. I helped get people there.'Now, Epps admitted that in a text message to a relative on January 6. He's admitting crimes. He's never been even charged for those crimes. But what's so fascinating is that when those facts came up in his interview with the committee, someone on the committee responds this way, and we're quoting: 'I just want to understand a little more your use of the word orchestrated. It sounds to me like at this point, when you sent this text, you had turned away in part because of seeing some things that you didn't agree with. Is that right? Like when you sent this, you were already on your way from the capital because of concerns of people taking it in a different direction. 'Is that the most leading question ever asked in the history of a congressional hearing? Probably. And the whole interview goes on like this. Keep in mind, Ray Epps is one of the only people caught on camera that day encouraging others to break the law. He's one of the only ones and yet he's never been charged and the January 6 Committee was on his side.Did he talk about January 6before it happened with any employee of the U.S. government? We don't know. We do know that two years after January 6, long after an awful lot of other people have gone to jail for walking around the Capitol building, Ray Epps is still a free man. He's never been charged, much less imprisoned in solitary confinement like so many others. Why is that?Well, let's just stop lying. At this point, it's pretty obvious why that is. But of course, they're still lying about it. "

Pottinger and Matthews testified live, the testimony of others was recorded.Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democratic panel member from Virginia said Trump 'did not call to issue orders. He did not call to offer assistance.'Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, who was participating in the hearing remotely due to a coronavirus diagnosis, said that the committee will 'reconvene in September' as the 'investigation goes forward.'Rep. Cheney added that the committee has 'considerably more to do.'In the closing statements, committee members argued that former President Trump violated his oath of office by not doing more to dissuade the rioters.'Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump's conduct on January 6th was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,' Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger said. 'It is a stain on our history. It is a dishonor to all those who have sacrificed and died in service of our democracy. When we present our full findings, we will recommend changes to laws and policies to guard against another January 6th. The reason that's imperative is that the forces Donald Trump ignited that day have not gone away.'Andrew Mark Miller is a writer at Fox News.

  "text": "In media news today, an MSNBC reporter warns that Republicans in state legislature are passing voting laws that make 'January 6 every day,\u2019 a CNN medical guest says that companies should not treat the unvaccinated and vaccinated as equal, and a White House reporter asks Jen Psaki why Biden hasn\u2019t \u2018focused more on scolding the unvaccinated.\u2019'Descriptions of what happened are also similar to how they were a year ago after it happened,' CBS News wrote in its article on Sunday. 'People widely call it a protest that went too far, but how much further becomes more partisan. Most Americans \u2014 including most Democrats, but just a fifth of Republicans \u2014 call it an insurrection and describe it as an attempt to overturn the election and the government.'The graphic presented four options to the question as well as the results broken down by party affiliation. 85% of Democrats viewed Jan. 6 as 'an insurrection' or 'trying to overthrow' the government while only 21% and 18% of Republicans agreed respectively. Meanwhile, the graphic showed that 47% of Republicans viewed Jan. 6 as 'patriotism' and 56% viewed it as 'defending freedom,' something less than 13% of Democrats agreed with. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.6 points.While CBS acknowledged in its report that Americans 'widely call it a protest that went too far,' the liberal network significantly downplayed the bipartisan nature of that response.For starters, 'a protest that went too far' was the overwhelming favorite of the 2,046 Americans who were polled with 76% agreeing with that characterization of Jan. 6. The second most popular result was 'trying to overturn the election and keep Donald Trump in power' with 63%. Both of those options were omitted in the graphic bolstered by CBS. Meanwhile, 'an insurrection,' which came at a distant third with 55% of Americans was kept in the graphic among the others which polled even less popular.Among those who said Jan. 6 was 'a protest that went too far,' a whopping 80% were Republicans and 69% were Democrats. Those who described themselves as Trump voters felt that way even more so with 84% while 70% of Biden voters felt the same.Notably, 80% of independents also described Jan. 6 as a 'protest that went too far' while only 56% said it was 'an insurrection.'Critics panned CBS News for how the Jan. 6 poll was presented.Others blasted the network for not even including 'riot' as an option for polled Americans.CBS News did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.Joseph A.

  "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out the Stephen Colbert staffers for breaching the Capitol building and gives his take on how the government should respond.",
  "date": "June 20, 2022 10:38pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the arrest of Stephen Colbert staffers after they breached the Capitol building on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'As we were speaking on the air at that very moment, a team of seven saboteurs had entered the Capitol grounds and then proceeded, as saboteurs do, to breach the Capitol itself. Inside those hallowed grounds, within the very womb of democracy, these wreckers began their hunt for sitting members of Congress. That happened, ladies and gentlemen, and if it sounds shocking to you, it gets more harrowing from there.This was not some spontaneous outbreak of insurrection. No, this was a meticulously planned coup from afar. The group in the Capitol was under the direct control of an extremist called Stephen Colbert, who as a White man, is, by definition a White extremist. While inside, the insurrectionists tried to gain access to a restricted area, but they were thwarted by brave law enforcement who arrived, risking their very lives to remove the insurrectionists from the premises. But it wasn't enough because hours later, an aide to Congressman Auchinclosssecretly permitted the insurrectionists to reenter the Capitol complex. And then around 8:30 p.m., they cause some kind of disturbance. The details are murky as of tonight, but according to one report, they were banging on windows inside the Capitol, trashing the place, committing violence against our democracy. And for that, apparently, we are hearing tonight, they were put in jail, but within hours they were out again. Now, the man who controlled this attempted to coup, Stephen Colbert, knew exactly what he was doing. He knew the stakes. He knew the crimes he was committing and we know that because just last year, this White extremist, Stephen Colbert, explained that grown men who unlawfully enter the Capitol to harass sitting members of Congress are not pranksters. They're not protesters. They're domestic terrorists. Oh, it's shocking. These are domestic terrorists. Stephen Colbert, in what the literary community refers to as foreshadowing, described his own coup, and yet Stephen Colbert somehow still has access to the airwaves and to digital media, spreading his hate unfettered, convincing future generations of insurrectionists to do what his team of saboteurs did last week. That must stop. People who plan coups must be silenced. There's recent precedent for that, and anyone who disagrees should be disconnected from Amazon Web Services immediately. No spreading hate, but stopping White extremist Stephen Colbert from passing on his message of insurrection to the country won't solve what the rest of us are living with and that's trauma and like all trauma, journalists are affected most profoundly. We're scarred by what we saw. We're all KasieHunt tonight. It'll be a long time before we can revisit the Capitol building, before we can forget where we were when democracy shook on its very foundations. It's going to take therapy. It's going to take a lot of support from our fellow survivors before we can recapture the carefree innocence that Stephen Colbert stole from us, before we can feel safe again. We're not alone in our despair tonight.Yeah, journalists feel this stuff deeply. People say, 'Oh, you're just robots, just automatons inert, hardened, callous to the news. You don't feel.' But we do. We do feel. You see something like that. You see an insurrection take place before your very eyes and it hurts you. It changes you. You're not the same person. How long will it take to heal? It's impossible to know. CNN just interviewed a Rolling Stone journalist who, after a year and a half after the last insurrection, still hasn't healed. Watch. Now you look at something like that and you're tempted to dismiss it out of hand, 'Oh, you're having trouble sleeping? You sob for no reason? Well, that's because you have a barren, personal life. You're celibate. You're only meaningful human contact comes from the Uber Eats guy. You live out your emotional life on Netflix. That's your core problem. It couldn't really be an insurrection that made you cry.' Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, stop 'or disrupted your sleep,' but it can. For a journalist, this stuff hurts, but if you think it's bad for us in the news media, what do you think it was like for the lawmakers who were trapped inside Thursday night? In the last insurrection, even though she was nowhere near the Capitol \u2013 she was probably getting her nails done, but it didn't matter \u2013 Sandy Cortez nearly died.'Boom, boom, boom!' That's what an insurrection looks like, but there's no charade-like miming they can't ever fully express the pain inside. We're going to deal with that in our quiet alone time, possibly wearing an upscale turtleneck. We'll let you know. But the question is, once we've had an act of war like this, how does the country respond? How do we all respond? 'Boom, boom, boom!' as Sandy would say.Well, obviously, we need a commission, of course, and a criminal investigation. There's probably one underway, by the way and then a day of remembrance, because you can't let the memory die. So, who's going to lead this? Well, the obvious candidates, Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and speaking of crying, Adam Kinzinger.They're the naturals. We called them today to see what they're planning. How are we going to commemorate this latest insurrection? They haven't gotten back to us yet, probably sleeping or weeping. But we can assume from past experience that Adam Kinzinger feels this really deeply, really deeply. Watch.Yeah, Adam Kinzinger is right and we 've made fun of him in the past like a grown dude crying on TV. We mocked that. We apologized. Adam Kinzinger, we can recover. But there's only one path toward recovery and if you talk to any recovery expert, they will tell you the way to recover is to viciously punish the people who hurt your feelings\u2014step one. It's always step one.So, we're going to have to mete out some pretty serious punishment. Stephen Colbert's team of insurrectionists have been jailed for one night. That's not a lot. The penalty for insurrection is death. We're not calling for that here. This is a moderate show. These are our fellow Americans. We owe them a second chance. Thankfully, there's recent precedent to help guide an appropriate punishment."

  "text": "Tucker examines the disproportionate punishment given to those in the Capitol on Jan 6 and those participating in BLM protestsWe still don\u2019t know who shot Ashli Babbitt, or why. No one will tell us. But then, when you\u2019re fighting insurrectionists, you don\u2019t have to explain yourself. You just hyperventilate about QAnon, and then you do whatever you want. When a group of sad, disenfranchised people who have been left out of the modern economy show up at your office, you don\u2019t have to listen to their complaints, not for a second. Why would you? You thought listening to people\u2019s complaints was democracy? No, these people threaten democracy. You can even shoot one of them, if you want, and get away with it. Killing people without explaining yourself is an established part of counterinsurgency. If you don\u2019t believe it, check out what happened in the Second World War.Until late last month, a man called Michael Sherwin worked for the administration as a prosecutor in Washington. Sherwin bragged that his office rounded up about 400 people who were in or near the Capitol on Jan.6. You may be wondering if 400 people really committed crimes that day. It depends how you define 'crime.' Here's Michael Sherwin's definition:So now it\u2019s clear. It wasn\u2019t that 400 people broke actual laws. No, their crime, said the federal prosecutor, was 'thumbing their noses at the public,' meaning the Democratic Party. It wasn\u2019t 'insurrection.' It was showing disrespect to Joe Biden and his enforcers like Michael Sherwin, and that can\u2019t happen.That\u2019s why Michael Sherwin decided to use 'shock and awe' \u2014 to teach them a permanent lesson about expressing their political opinions. As Sherwin explained, 'the scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably DOJ history.'And he may be right. How big and how serious is this investigation into those insurrectionists? So serious that the FBIhas stopped investigating other crimes, and not minor crimes.So, in order to send a message to people with unacceptable political ideas in Washington, D.C., we\u2019re not going after people who sell fentanyl, a drug that has killed more than100,000 Americans, or child pornographers. They won\u2019t be punished. So who are these people who are being perused in lieu of tracking down fentanyl dealers and child pornographers? Who\u2019s experiencing the Biden administration's'shock and awe'?'Griffith walked into the U.S. Capitol building through the open doors on January 6, telling the agents he did not see any police officers as he entered the building. He then went into a nearby office where he 'interacted with some individuals' before exiting the building. However, he reentered the U.S. Capitol Building again a short time later, where he meandered through the hallways and took a few photos.'For that act of terrorism, Anthony Griffith faces seven years in prison. Prosecutor Michael Sherwin is fine with that. At one point in his interview with '60 Minutes,' Sherwin was asked about bringing sedition charges against the people he arrests, the people who meandered. Sure, he replied. Why not?Meandering is sedition, says Michael Sherwin.Just for reference, federal prosecutors aren\u2019t supposed to reveal themselves as partisan lunatics on television. Sherwin\u2019s comments were so grotesquely out of line that a federal judge appointed by Barack Obama, Amit Mehta, said he was considering issuing a gag order to make Michael Sherwin be quiet. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals -- the most powerful appellate court in the country -- just ordered the DOJ to start distinguishing between actual criminals, and people who walked through open doors inside the Capitol building.That ruling came after the DOJ tried to convince a judge that two defendants -- Lisa Eisenhart and her son, Eric Munchel - should face indefinite detention. Neither Lisa Eisenhart nor her son damaged any property at the Capitol or committed any violence. They just walked in to what we used to refer to as the People\u2019s House.And yet, somehow Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ convinced a trial judge that Lisa Eisenhart was a 'threat to our Republic,' and that her son was a 'would-be martyr.' Keep in mind, these are people whose only crime was trespassing in the Capitol. We\u2019re not endorsing that, but some perspective please.It took a ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to bring some perspective.'Two individuals who did not engage in any violence and who were not involved in planning or coordinating the activities \u2014 seemingly would pose little threat,' the appellate panel wrote. Yeah, seemingly.But the judges still didn't release Eric Munchel or Lisa Eisenhart. That's how much power these prosecutors have. They can keep you in prisoneven when a three-judge appellate panel concludes there's no reason for you to be in prison.That's probably why prosecutors still haven't, as of tonight, released a man called Jacob Chansely, otherwise known as the 'Chewbacca Guy.' Like Eric Munchel and Lisa Eisenhart, Jacob Chansely isn't accused of committing any act of violence. He's not accused of breaking any property. What exactly did he do? We can answer that question. Video shows him walking through the Senate chamber.'Chewbacca Guy' is still in jail. He\u2019ll be there indefinitely. Before you shrug that off, think about what that\u2019s actually like. You don\u2019t want to think about it.A number of people arrested on Jan.6are still rotting in the D.C.municipal lockup, one of the foulest detention centers in the country. It's atruly repulsive, mismanaged place. Ask anyone from Washington, D.C. what they would do not to be thrown in the D.C. jail. It\u2019s that bad. Some say they\u2019ve been beaten, not surprisingly, by guards there. Lawyers for one, a man called Ryan Samsel, sayhe was beaten so badly, he has a skull fracture and is now blind in one eye.How many Antifa rioters or BLM vandals can say that? Did they lose their eyesight from being beaten in jail? Well, as a group, they didn't spend much time in jail. Most were spring on bail immediately, which politicians like Kamala Harris helped them pay.Last summer, for example, authorities released a terrorism suspect in Oklahoma called Eric Christopher Ruffin, after Black Lives Matter posted his $750,000 bond. According to authorities, Ruffin, 'encouraged others to burn an Oklahoma County sheriff's van and an Oklahoma City bail bonds business May 30. The van was destroyed. CJ's Bail Bonds had $8,850 in damage from broken windows.'But Eric Christopher Ruffin went home, and he went home for one reason: Unlike the Chewbacca Guy, he didn't upset the people in charge. He didn't walk in their 'sacred chamber' and talk about 'liberty and rights.' He just tried to vaporize some police vehicles,and that\u2019s exactly what our political class wanted him to do. So he\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s fine. He hasn\u2019t lost his eyesight getting a beating in jail.This kind of thing, unequal treatment under the law, is on stark display across the country right now. We could spend an hour giving you examples, but here are a couple:The suspect, Darlene Montoya, was in jail for a serious crime -- she'd been accused of assault with a deadly weapon. But, is that really as serious as meandering through the Capitol building? No, of course not, it\u2019s not 'insurrection.' So, Darlene Montoya got to walk out of jail and find someone else to hurt.Meanwhile, in Detroit, a judge decided to release four felons who had been convicted of criminal sexual assault, and another 14 people who had committed assault. The judge claimed the coronavirus justified their release. According to prosecutors, one of those felons went out and raped three women at knifepoint.Why haven\u2019t you read this? No one covers any of this because it happens too often to notice.Last month, however, one of these murders was caught on video. It was impossible to ignore. Two teenage girls -- one 15, and one 13 -- carjacked and killed a Pakistani immigrant driver called Mohammad Anwar. He has kids, and was just trying to work, trying to make a buck. As Mohammad Anwar lay dying on the sidewalk, one of the girls complained that the real crisis was she couldn\u2019t find her cellphone.You kill a guy who\u2019s just trying to work, and then you can\u2019t even be bothered to notice as he dies on the sidewalk because you\u2019re worried about your phone. There\u2019s a big problem with these girls. They\u2019re young, for sure, but they did something awful.The biggest threat to you, if you\u2019re an autocrat, is people who mock you, and don\u2019t take you seriously, and sneer at you. You want them in prison, and autocrats are doing just that."

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.A senior source in the U.S House of Representatives told Fox News that seven individuals associated with Stephen Colbert's show were arrested.The group was unescorted and charged with illegal entry to House office buildings after hours.Fox News is told that the 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' team applied to get press credentials for the Jan. 6 hearing, but the House Radio/TV Gallery rejected the request because they are not considered 'news.' The issue didn't go to the Radio/TV Correspondents Association, which usually handles credentialing.In addition to a regular Capitol Hill press pass, a special 'overlay' is required for members of the press who want to be in the room for the Jan. 6 Committee hearings.Members of Colbert's team could have been in House office buildings if they were invited, which they were. Fox News is told that Colbert's team conducted interviews earlier on Thursday with members of the Jan. 6 Committee, including Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla. They also interviewed Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass.When Capitol Police spotted members of Colbert's team at the Jan. 6 Committee area, they were schooled away, and left the House office building.At some point, they were let back in to the Longworth House Office Building sometime after 4 p.m. by an aide to Auchincloss and were unattended for several hours. Sources tell Fox News that the aide believed the group had more interviews to do.Sources tell Fox News that the group apparently roamed the House office buildings while they were unattended for hours.'On June 16, 2022, at approximately 8:30 p.m., U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) received a call for a disturbance in the Longworth House Office Building. Responding officers observed seven individuals, unescorted and without Congressional ID, in a sixth-floor hallway. The building was closed to visitors, and these individuals were determined to be a part of a group that had been directed by the USCP to leave the building earlier in the day,' the statement says. 'They were charged with Unlawful Entry. This is an active criminal investigation, and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with the U.S. Attorney.'A spokesperson for CBS told Fox News that Triumph the Insult Comic Dog was on-site at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and Thursday to record interviews for a comedy segment on behalf of 'The Late Show,' and said the interviews were authorized and pre-arranged with Congressional aides.The spokesperson said that members of the production team stayed to 'film stand-ups' and other comedy elements in the halls when they were detained.'On Wednesday, June 15 and Thursday, June 16, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog was on-site at the Capitol with a production team to record interviews for a comedy segment on behalf of \u2018The Late Show.\u2019 Their interviews at the Capitol were authorized and pre-arranged through Congressional aides of the members interviewed,' the spokesperson said.

The judge found that two other rioters had destroyed the window before Seefried cleared the piece of glass.Widely published photographs showed Kevin Seefried carrying a Confederate battle flag inside the Capitol after he and Hunter, then 22, entered the building through a broken window.An attorney for Hunter Seefried had asked for probation and home detention instead of prison time. He said in court papers that his client only went to the Capitol that day because his father pushed him to join. And he noted that the son never hurt or threatened anyone at the Capitol.'Hunter is a decent, hardworking and caring young man, who was misled and got caught up in the unfortunate events of January 6, 2021,' attorney Edson Bostic said in an email. 'He is very remorseful and wished he could relive and change his behavior that day.'Kevin Seefried is scheduled to be sentenced in January.The judge also convicted the Seefrieds of misdemeanor charges that they engaged in disorderly conduct and illegally demonstrated inside the building. But he acquitted Hunter Seefried of other misdemeanor charges.Roughly 300 Capitol riot defendants have been sentenced, with sentences ranging from probation to 10 years behind bars."

'I think the Justice Department will ignore it.''The concern that the Justice Department has, or at least should have, is that they [the criminal referrals] can have the counterproductive effect of undermining whatever prosecution, if any, that the Justice Department decides to bring because they give former President Trump the ability to make the claim, if he's charged, that the charges are the result of political pressure rather than evidence,' McCarthy added.'Even if they brought criminal charges that were based solely on evidence that they believed was reliable, they would still have to combat an argument in the trial that a heavily dominated Democratic committee induced the Democratic Justice Department to bring criminal charges in order to sideline the sitting Democratic president\u2019s likely rival in the 2024 election, which is not a position to want to be in as a prosecutor,' McCarthy said.Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley, another former prosecutor and professor at Georgetown University Law School, said Monday\u2019s business meeting that was heavily choreographed 'missed the mark' in an effort to present a case that Trump should be criminally charged.'The failure of the committee to offer any new and direct evidence of criminal conduct was telling,' Turley said. 'The fact is that the [January] 6 Committee failed to change many minds largely because of what was on display in the final public meeting. It was the same highly scripted, one-sided account repeated mantra-like for months.''There is justifiable anger over these accounts, but this hearing was billed as presenting the case for criminal charges. It missed that mark by a considerable measure,' Turley added.Turley also criticized the mainstream media coverage of the committee\u2019s activity, saying that coverage 'downplayed the flaring failure' of the committee to produce promised 'bombshell evidence of a criminal conspiracy by Trump.'The committee's final report of its findings will be released on Wednesday.Brianna Herlihy is a politics writer for Fox News Digital."

  "text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram breaks down the latest on the January 6 Committee's final meeting on former President Trump on 'The Story.'The panel, which is made up of seven Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans, argued during the committee's final meeting that Trump's conduct before and after Jan. 6 was 'unlawful.''President Trump\u2019s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision,' the introductory report reads. 'It was premeditated.'The committee is expected to release its final comprehensive report on Wednesday.The document claims that even after legal challenges to overturn the 2020 election failed, Trump pressured the Justice Department and state officials into decertifying the results. That push, according to the committee, culminated in demands that then-Vice President Mike Pence reject Electoral College votes from states won by President Biden.'Even key individuals who worked closely with President Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on January 6th ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,' states the report.The summary includes the methods the committee took to come to more than 15 specific findings.The panel's introductory report serves as the basis for its decision to refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Lawmakers say they have sufficient evidence that Trump obstructed an official proceeding of Congress, conspired to defraud the federal government, made a false statement, and incited, assisted or aided an insurrection.'No man who would behave that way at that moment in time can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again,' said Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican. 'He is unfit for any office.'Apart from Trump, the Jan. 6 committee also referred several GOP lawmakers to the House Ethics Committee for defying its congressional subpoenas. The GOP lawmakers include House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Also on the list is Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.'This is just another partisan and political stunt made by a select committee that knowingly altered evidence, blocked minority representation on a committee for the first time in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, and failed to respond to Mr. Jordan\u2019s numerous letters and concerns surrounding the politicization and legitimacy of the committee\u2019s work,' said a spokesman for Jordan.Over its 18-month tenure, the committee obtained access to tens of thousands of documents and conducted nearly 1,000 interviews related to the Capitol protests.Haris Alic is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering Congress."

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.'The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States,' the committee wrote in a filing submitted in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.The committee made the claims in response to a lawsuit by Trump adviser John Eastman, a lawyer and law professor who was consulting with Trump as he attempted to overturn the election. Eastman is trying to withhold documents from the committee.In a statement late Wednesday, Charles Burnham, Eastman\u2019s attorney, said his client has a responsibility 'to protect client confidences, even at great personal risk and expense.'Burnham added, 'The Select Committee has responded to Dr. Eastman\u2019s efforts to discharge this responsibility by accusing him of criminal activity.'The brief filed Wednesday was an effort to knock down Eastman\u2019s attorney-client privilege claims. In doing so, the committee argued there is a legal exception allowing the disclosure of communications regarding ongoing or future crimes.The committee said it has evidence that Trump sought to obstruct an official proceeding \u2014 in this case, the certification of the election results \u2014 by trying to strong-arm Pence to delay the proceedings so there would be additional time to 'manipulate' the results.'The evidence supports an inference that President Trump and members of his campaign knew he had not won enough legitimate state electoral votes to be declared the winner of the 2020 Presidential election during the January 6 Joint Session of Congress, but the President nevertheless sought to use the Vice President to manipulate the results in his favor,' the filing states.In a Jan. 6, 2021, email exchange between Eastman and Jacob revealed by the committee, Eastman pushed for Pence to intervene in his ceremonial role and halt the certification of the electoral votes, a step Pence had no power to take.Jacob replied: 'I respect your heart here. I share your concerns about what Democrats will do once in power. I want election integrity fixed. But I have run down every legal trail placed before me to its conclusion, and I respectfully conclude that as a legal framework, it is a results-oriented position that you would never support if attempted by the opposition, and essentially entirely made up.'He added, 'And thanks to your bulls\u2014-, we are now under siege.'So far, lawmakers and investigators have interviewed hundreds of people, including members of Trump\u2019s family and his chief of staff as well as his allies in the seven swing states where the former president tried and failed to prove he won. The panel has also sought out information from members of Congress and subpoenaed records and testimony from top social media platforms they believe had a hand in the spreading of election misinformation.The committee is expected to fully release its findings in a lengthy report or series of reports later this year, ahead of the midterm elections. The panel is also planning days or weeks of hearings starting in April with some of the witnesses who testified.In other transcripts released as part of the filing, former senior Justice Department official Richard Donoghue described trying to convince Trump that claims of election fraud were pure fiction. 'I told the President myself that several times, in several conversations, that these allegations about ballots being smuggled in a suitcase and run through the machines several times, it was not true, that we had looked at it, we looked at the video, we interviewed the witnesses, and it was not true.'At one point, Donoghue said, he had to reassure Trump that the Justice Department had investigated a report that someone has transported a tractor-trailer full of ballots from New York to Pennsylvania. The department found no evidence to support the allegations, Donoghue said.The transcripts also shed colorful detail on a contentious Jan. 3, 2021, meeting at which Trump contemplated replacing his acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, with an assistant who promised to get to the bottom of the president\u2019s bogus claims of election fraud.That assistant, Jeffrey Clark, had been the department\u2019s top environmental enforcement lawyer for a period, a fact that led to some derision from colleagues at the meeting when it was pointed out that Clark had not been a criminal prosecutor.'And he kind of retorted by saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve done a lot of very complicated appeals and civil litigation, environmental litigation, and things like that,\u2019' Donoghue said. 'And I said, \u2018That\u2019s right. You\u2019re an environmental lawyer. How about you go back to your office, and we\u2019ll call you when there\u2019s an oil spill.\u2019'"

  "date": "June 21, 2022 10:48pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson rips comedian Stephen Colbert following the arrest of his several staffers for breaching the Capitol on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Once on federal property, Colbert's employees did what they came to do, which was disrupt the business of Congress, and apparently they were not subtle about doing it. They pounded on doors and yelled. Whatever they did, it got people's attention. It takes an awful lot for a police force controlled by Nancy Pelosi to arrest a group of left-wing entertainment figures, but that's exactly what happened next. Capitol Hill police arrested seven Colbert employees and brought them to jail. All seven of them were charged with unlawful entry. 'We do not condone any inappropriate activity within the Capitol,' Jake Auchincloss\u2019 office told us today. It was a factual matter. That is not true. In fact, Jake Auchincloss has a recent history of condoning criminal behavior in the Capitol. Just this March, surveillance cameras in the complex caughtJake Auchincloss\u2019chief of staff, that would be a former Adam Schiff staffer called Tim Hyssop, vandalizing the front door of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greens Personal Office. Hyssop did this not once but several times violently, like a man obsessed. Capitol Hill police quickly filed an arrest warrant against him because Tim Haysom clearly posed a threat to a member of Congress. But Jake Auchincloss did not fire him. Instead, Jake Auchincloss defended Hyssop\u2019s vandalism as noble and justified. 'Our office is not going to apologize,' read a long and self-righteous statement from Jake Auchincloss. Now, whatever you think of her politics, Marjorie Taylor Greene is a sitting member of Congress. Preventing her or any other member of Congress from carrying out official duties as a public representative is, by definition, an attack on democracy. So, how is what Stephen Colbert did different from what the protesters on January 6 have been convicted of doing? That's a very good question and it's a question that Colbert himself spent the weekend thinking about. His conclusion? Well, unlike Trump voters, Stephen Colbert is a very good person. Therefore, any comparison to Trump voters is not simply ridiculous. It is a moral crime. Watch. Yeah, it was a toy dog. 'It's shameful.' In other words, 'When you criticize me, you're really criticizing the brave Capitol Police officers who arrested the people who worked for me, the ones who committed the crimes I asked them to commit and I, for one, will not stand for that.' That's what he just said. Now, what you have there is not so much an explanation. In fact, it doesn't explain anything. Instead, it's a master's class on whiny, rich, liberal self-righteousness. It's a distillation of a worldview that is so concise and so perfect, it is certain to be studied by cultural historians of the future, seeking to understand how our civilization collapsed. 'Not only am I not sorry, you're the criminal for bringing it up. Stop hitting me,' he screams as he punches you in the face. That is passive aggression taken to the level of art. In any way, Colbert says, 'Shut up. I'm a comedian with a toy dog, you can't criticize me.' So, the question really is, is Stephen Colbert a comedian? Well, if you're one of the relatively few people still watching Stephen Colbert\u2019s show on CBS, you'll have to admit it is hard to tell. Most nights, Stephen Colbert sounds like the notably unfunny Karine Jean-Pierre. He sounds like a Biden flack delivering whatever talking points the White House tells him to repeat and if you doubt that, here's what it looks like.'Get the vax, peasants, surrender your guns, support Ukraine and remember, it's called Kiev now.' This isn't comedy. It's a very sad midlife crisis, but more than that, it's information war being waged against television viewers on behalf of the Democratic Party. At least when the White House press secretary does it, she admits what she's doing. Colbert hides behind his former job as a comedian. 'It was all a joke. When people I don't like break into the Capitol, it's insurrection. When we do it, it's sketch comedy, right?'It's getting harder to maintain that lie and here's how, you know, comedians have a sense of humor. It is, in fact, a job requirement, but Stephen Colbert does not. Stephen Colbert has lost his sense of humor along with the critical distance and perspective that make humor possible. At this point, he's just a partisan scold, and you know that for certain, because even as he watched the QAnon Shaman parade around the Capitol on January 6, Stephen Colbert did not laugh. Now, an actual comedian whatever is politics would have found that spectacle hilarious because\u2014let's be honest\u2014it was. 'Hey,' say the guy in the bear skin and the horn hat. That's not hilarious? Yes, it is hilarious. 'No, he's a seditious insurrectionist,' said Colbert, 'He needs to go to jail. He's a terrorist,' and when he was sent to jail, Colbert applauded. Now, that's how Maoist countries act. That's not how comedians act. So, Stephen Colbert may be a late-night host still for some reason, but he has zero sense of humor. He ought to step aside and let some young person who still gets the joke to have the job, but he won't. Here's Colbert on November 6, 2020. Watch. Those were real tears, the only real thing about that show. We're not trying to belabor the point, but the guy's not a comedian. You watch a comedian, you think, 'that guy's hilarious, I'd love to meet him.'Sad, he was talented at one point and so was Robert Smigel. That's one of the coal bear employees who was also arrested last week. Simel's been doing his dog puppet routine for 30 years. That's the one that Colbert is now hiding behind.' It was just a dog puppet.' The dog puppet was kind of funny during the Clinton administration. It is pure hackery now. Smigel keeps going because he's got a political message for him. 'I'm going to beat you over the head with my political message.' No one laughs at Robert Smigel anymore. It's pathetic. Who's funnier: Robert Smigel, or the guy who took pictures of himself at Nancy Pelosi's desk on January 6? Be honest, it's not even close. The guy at Pelosi's desk is hilarious compared to the guy with the talking dog and none of them is half as funny. Again, sorry it's true as Donald Trump and how do you know that? Show us the late night host who said anything half as amusing as Trump's Taco Bowl tweet. So, nobody watches anymore. That's fine. That's CBS's problem. But don't tell us you're a comedian and therefore exempt from the normal rules of behavior and the normal federal laws about trespassing because you're not. You did what they did, and you should be punished in exactly the same way. "

  "date": "October 25, 2022 11:30am EDT",
  "text": "A group of Trump voters debated with MSNBC analyst Elise Jordan over the January 6 narrative during a 'Morning Joe' segment which aired on Monday.The back-and-forth over the January 6 narrative, \u2013 which aired Monday on MSNBC \u2013 began with Jordan asking the group whether it was 'OK' for Republican Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano to be 'breaching one of the restricted areas' of the Capitol grounds.A male voter questioned the claim immediately, asking, 'Which area? Because I saw video where Capitol officers were taking away barriers and unlocking doors for people.' Several others seated with him agreed. Another man added, 'They opened the gates and let them in.'Jordan followed-up: 'So it shouldn\u2019t be disqualifying for an elected official if they participate in January 6th?' Most, if not all, either shook their heads or audibly responded, 'No.'She said, 'And the only one that died was a protestor there, not a Capitol police officer.' Another voter, elaborated, 'An unarmed female was shot by police.' The female voter declared, 'That\u2019s the only one who died.'Jordan rebutted the claim, stating, 'A police officer did die,' and she received pushback. 'No,' one responded swiftly, while another explained, 'He died of a heart attack.' Another voter said, 'It was a stroke.'She added, 'That\u2019s not on-site,' referencing the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died from a stroke one day after allegedly being pepper-sprayed by rioters at the Capitol building.Switching gears, Jordan asked the group what they thought of the riot in general, which she called 'pretty disturbing.' She also mentioned the vandalism and 'people throwing excrement at the walls.'The voter added, 'Anybody who harms anybody, anybody who caused property destruction, that needs to be dealt with. But if you\u2019re there making your voice heard at the people\u2019s house no less, that\u2019s again, it\u2019s a fundamental constitutional right of an American citizen. And people should not be being held political prisoner because of it.'The female voter chimed it, 'For misdemeanors. That\u2019s East Germany tactics.'The male voter then said, 'Our administration, I feel like, is using it as their Reichstag Fire. That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re using it as.'Jordan also asked about Trump\u2019s involvement in the riot, asking, 'Do you think that President Trump could have quelled the violence that day?' The collection of responses included, 'No,' and 'I don\u2019t think so.' Another female voter noted, 'It started when he was still speaking.'That voter noted she attended Trump\u2019s speech that day to see him speak one last time, prompting another female to ask her, 'So did he tell everybody to go and start rioting?' 'No,' the first lady replied, to which the second said, 'I didn\u2019t think so.' They both stressed that Trump asked the crowds to protest at the Capitol 'peacefully.'Others repeated the charge from some voices on the right that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., bore some responsibility for the melee for not beefing up security more at the Capitol. Reacting to the focus group on Monday, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough said the voters had been 'lied to' or 'duped' into believing the day was mostly peaceful.On the right, The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway called the voters 'legitimately impressive,' saying they had not fallen for a 'propaganda press narrative,' in response to a clip of the segment.The committee did not ask Trump to appear for an open hearing. Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives on a count of inciting an insurrection in 2021 but acquitted in the U.S. Senate for his actions around Jan. 6.Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital."

  "date": "February 10, 2021 10:32am EST",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Just before 11 a.m. Wednesday, I arrived at the Capitol, and all was calm and peaceful. I told my Uber driver to stay safe and went to work.I then went downstairs to the second floor outside the Senate chamber to find Republican senators to question about the results in Georgia and to watch the mahogany boxes holding the Electoral College certificates be paraded to the House chamber.After the boxes departed the Senate, a U.S. Capitol Police officer I know suggested I take a lookout the West Front windows.Popping back upstairs, I was preparing to go into the Senate chamber when Fox News showed live images of the protesters breaching the West Front.Still, I wasn\u2019t concerned. Itwas unfathomable they would ever get remotely close to entering the building.With a few Republicans planning to object to Arizona\u2019s electoral slate, I knew the Senate would return to session any minute for debate.Unlike the House chamber, you\u2019re not allowed to have electronics in the Senate chamber, so I gathered my pen and pad to take notes during Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell'sspeech at the top.The cameras in the Senate chamber are controlled by the Senate recording studio.Reporting from inside the chamber allows you to grab color and describe small details you wouldn\u2019t see on TV.For instance, before the speeches began, I could overhear Sen.Mitt Romney, R-Utah, telling Sen.Rob Portman, R-Ohio, 'That\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now ... outside,' as Romney showed Portman his phone screen. I didn\u2019t know what exactly they were talking about, but I\u2019m sure it was the situation outside the Capitol.The debate eventually began. McConnell spoke, followed by Schumer. I left midway through Schumer\u2019s speech to return to my office to type up my notes.Then I get a text from the pool of Hill journalists that the protesters made it inside the Capitol.I thought, O.K., a small handful got inside the building. No way the Capitol of the United States of America would be overrun by a violent mob.Thenthe video feed from the Senate floor abruptly stopped.A colleague from another network popped his head into my office asking if I saw what happened. 'No,'I replied, saying thatit just went off.A staffer was caught on a hot mic on the Senate floor saying 'The protesters are in the building.'Our evacuation point was supposed to be the Senate chamber, but it was too late. We had to lock the doors and hunker down in our offices.Soon after, a shelter-in-place announcement blared over the speakers.I was worried about one of my colleagues who was reporting from inside the House chamber. A report of a gunshot frightened all of us.Thankfully, anothercoworker, Kelly Phares, and I knew our other colleague was O.K. because she texted us while continuing to report the news in real time that the violent mob was trying to break down the House chamber doors.Thanks to heroic colleagues like her, we began to see images of what was happening inside the building. It was mind-boggling. The Capitol had been overrun by insurrectionists.Seeing images of smoke bombs going off in the Ohio Clock Corridor outside the Senate chamber, rioters on the floor of the Senateand clashes in the Capitol Rotunda,we suddenlyheard a loud commotion. The mob was downstairs.I told Phares and another coworker, Jared Halpern, to pack up everything they needed in case we needed to make a run for it.I didn\u2019t want to scare them, but I later told them that night I had planned an escape route if we needed it.Thankfully, the rioters never found us.Soon after, Capitol Police evacuated us to an 'undisclosed location.'We were safe next door to the room where all the senators and their staff were located.But I will never forget the walk to the undisclosed location, the smell of pepper spray and tear gasoutside the Chamber, and seeinggarbage and debris strewn on the floor.As we got to the Capitol basement, the smell was even worse and made it difficult to breathe.At the evacuation site, scores of FBI officers were there protecting us. I felt safe again.I can\u2019t even imagine what my journalistcolleagues in the House chamber or Capitol Rotunda went through. They are brave and heroic, dedicated to showing the world what went on inside the Capitol.One congressional aide barricaded alone inside his Capitol office described to reporters how rioters tried and failed to break down his locked door for 20 minutes.My phone constantly buzzed with worried friends asking if I was O.K. I definitely should have texted my dad back sooner, but you lose all sense of time in the moment. Plus, I still had to report on the story.Some senators would occasionally walk past us. I had to keep reporting.Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and others,spoke to reporters.But when I tried asking Sen.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, if President Trump\u2019s rhetoric caused what happened today, he ignored me. Sen.Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., ignored me as well. These were two of the senators leading the charge to object to Electoral College certification.After about two-and-a-half hours, police escorted everyone \u2013 as well as the mahogany Electoral College boxes\u2013back to the Capitol.They told us not to touch anything because pepper spray and tear gas residue blanketed the halls of Congress. It covered everything:floors, railings, statues, walls, and more. There werealso broken glass, furnitureand garbage strewn about inside the Capitol.The Senate and House eventually returned to session, and I continued to work interviewing senators and shouting questions at Vice President Mike Pence, whoignored them.Just before 4 a.m., Congress finally certified the Electoral College.I caught Speaker Nancy Pelosi leaving the House floor and asked her what she was thinking now that this day was finally over.Pelosi, who looked absolutely exhausted, replied it was almost 4 a.m. and said she didn\u2019t want to do any interviews.I didn\u2019t blame her. We just survived an insurrection. I was exhausted, too."

Schiff said Sunday he believes the 'evidence is there' to pursue a criminal case against Trump.'Congress has no formal role in Justice Department decisions and they can make recommendations today,' Pence responded, adding the committee has a 'partisan taint' that has led to many Americans ignoring the hearings.'But when it comes to the Justice Department's decision about bringing charges in the future, I would hope that they would not bring charges against the former president \u2026 As I wrote in my book, I think the president's actions and words on January 6th were reckless. But I don't know that it is criminal to take bad advice from lawyers. And so I hope the Justice Department is careful.'The first referral recommended by the committee is for Trump's obstruction an official proceeding of Congress. The committee will also refer Trump to DOJ for conspiracy to defraud the federal government, making a false statement and inciting, assisting, or aiding and comforting an insurrection.Pence said that such an indictment against a former U.S. president would be 'divisive.'The committee\u2019s unprecedented criminal referral holds no official legal weight, and a final determination in whether to pursue the charges will be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department.Joshua Q.

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.But the trail grew cold almost immediately. A year later, federal investigators are no closer to learning the person\u2019s identity. And a key question remains: Was there a connection between the pipe bombs and the riot at the Capitol?The investigation has been a massive undertaking for federal law enforcement officials. More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the Jan. 6 attack, and arrests are still being made regularly.But for the FBI agents working on the cases, the job is far from over. Agents and investigative analysts have been poring over thousands of hours of surveillance video, going second by second in each video to try to capture clear images of people who attacked officers inside the Capitol.'This investigation takes time because it is a lot of lot of work, a lot of painstaking work that they look at the video kind of frame by frame,' said Steven D\u2019Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s field office in Washington.In one case, police body camera footage captures a man using a cane with electric prods on the end jabbing at officers and shocking them as they fight to hold back the riotous crowd trying to break through a barricaded line of officers at one of the doors of the Capitol. The crackling sound of the electricity can be heard as he prods his cane into one of the officers. The man, known only as 'AFO114' \u2014 using shorthand for 'assaulting a federal officer' \u2014 is still being sought.'The assaults against the police officers are extremely serious,' D\u2019Antuono said. More than 100 police officers were attacked by rioters on Jan. 6, some attacked by multiple people and some attacked multiple times, he said.In another video, a man is seen repeatedly bashing a police officer over the head with a 6-foot (1.8-meter) metal pole as he tries to push his way into the Capitol. And a third shows a man spraying some kind of chemical from a can into the faces of other officers.'There is still a lot of work to be done on this,' D\u2019Antuono said. 'There were a lot of people up there at the Capitol, a lot of people that either committed violence up there did other unlawful actions up there.'In the search for the person who left the pipe bombs at the RNC and DNC offices, investigators have interviewed more than 900 people, collected 39,000 video files and examined more than 400 leads. They have dived into the components of the explosives and have been working to try to discern anything they can about the suspect, from analyzing the person's gait to trying to collect information about purchases of the distinctive Nike sneakers the person wore.But they are still no closer to finding the suspect\u2019s identity and are hoping renewed attention on the video of the person may spark a tip to crack the case.The explosive devices were placed outside the two buildings between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2021, but weren\u2019t located by law enforcement until the next day. U.S. Capitol Police and agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were called to the Republican National Committee\u2019s office around 12:45 p.m. on Jan. 6. About 30 minutes later, as the agents and bomb technicians were still investigating at the RNC, another call came in for a similar explosive device found at the Democratic National Committee headquarters nearby. The bombs were rendered safe, and no one was hurt.Video released by the FBI shows a person in a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask and gloves appearing to place one of the explosives under a bench outside the DNC and separately shows the person walking in an alley near the RNC before the bomb was placed there. The person wore black and light gray Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers with a yellow logo.'We\u2019ve used and continue to use every investigative tool that we lawfully have to find this individual,' D\u2019Antuono said. But, a year later, investigators still don\u2019t know whether the suspect is a man or a woman. The person carried the bombs \u2014 made of threaded galvanized pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder \u2014 in a backpack.'We\u2019re still nose to the grindstone here and trying to find this individual, trying to bring the person to justice,' D'Antuono said. 'But there is hopefully maybe somebody still out there that knows the person or sees the video again.'It is unclear whether the bombs were related to planning for the insurrection or whether they were unrelated to the deadly riot. Both buildings are within a few blocks of the Capitol.And the fact the suspect was covered from head to toe has made identifying the person extremely difficult for the FBI.'In normal times, like if this wasn\u2019t COVID,' D\u2019Antuono said, 'a person walking down the street in D.C. covered from head to toe with a mask on, glasses and gloves would have been a red flag.'"

  "text": "Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald joins Laura Ingraham to discuss rising concern over FBI's tracking of AmericansProsecutors arguedin a new filing on Monday that Chansley is a danger to the community, explaining he held a speared weapon as he confronted officers inside the Capitol, wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Penceand spoke about ridding the government of traitors.But Chansley categorized his actions on Jan. 6 differently, rejecting the notion thatwhat he did was an attack on this country. He also claimed he remained peaceful after officers 'waved' him into the Capitol building.'My actions were not an attack on this country. That is incorrect. That is inaccurate entirely,' he told '60 Minutes Plus' correspondent Laurie Segall, describing instead how he prayed, sang songs inside the building and prevented theft and vandalism.'I sang a song and that\u2019s a part of Shamanism. It\u2019s about creating positive vibrations in a sacred chamber,' Chansley said. 'I also stopped people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the Senate. I actually stopped someone from stealing muffins out of the break room. I also said a prayer in that sacred chamber because it was my intention to bring divinity, to bring God back into the Senate.'Segall pressed him, pointing out that he was not legally allowed to be in that chamber.'That is the one very serious regret that I have, was believing that when we were waved in by police officers that it was acceptable,' he said, describing himself as a lover of this country and a believer in the Constitution, the 'truth and our founding principles' andGod.Chansley also made a distinction that although he regrets entering the Capitol, he does not regret supporting former President Donald Trump --but he was disappointed not to have received a presidential pardon during Trump's last days in office.'I developed a lot of sympathy for Donald Trump because it seemed like the media was picking on him,'Chansley said.'It seemed like the establishment was going after him unnecessarily or unfairly and I had been a victim of that all of my life whether it be at school or at home, so in many ways I identified with many of the negative things he was going through.''I honestly believed and still believe that he cares about the Constitution,' Chansley continued, referring to Trump.'That he cares about the American people. And that\u2019s also why it wounded me so deeply and disappointed me so greatly that I and others did not get a pardon.''I regret entering that building. I regret entering that building with every fiber of my being,' he added. 'But you don\u2019t regret the loyalty to Donald Trump?' Segall asked. Chansley responded flatly,'No.'Authorities have saidChansley was allegedly among the first people to force their way into the Capitol building on Jan. 6, disobeyed orders to leave, refused an officer\u2019s request to use Chansley\u2019s bullhorn to tell rioters to leave the Senate chamber, called Pence a traitor and wrote a note to the then-vice president saying, 'It\u2019s only a matter of time, justice is coming.'While prosecutors say the spear attached to a flagpole carried by Chansley into the Capitol was allegedly a weapon, his attorney has characterized the spear as an ornament.The defense lawyer also argued the message that Chansley penned to Pence wasn\u2019t intended to be threatening and said his client is suffering from digestive tract difficulties, even though he has been given organic food, as he had requested.Chansley, who calls himself the 'QAnon Shaman' and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, unsuccessfully sought a pardon from Trump. In February, he issued an apology, saying he was wrong for entering the Capitol building on Jan. 6. He has pleaded not guilty to two felony and four misdemeanor charges. Chansley also made headlines after a judge approved a request that he be given organic food in jail to honor his religious beliefs. He is being held in Washington, D.C., after he was moved from an Arizona jail following his initial arrest.Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

  "title": "Ex-Capitol Police Chief Sund regrets resigning after riot, wants deeper FBI dive on domestic extremists",
  "description": "Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said during a congressional hearing Tuesday that he regrets resigning in the days after the Jan. 6 insurrection, as he argued intelligence failures were to blame in allowing a \"coordinated attack\" that\u00a0overwhelmed\u00a0officers at the Capitol and saw rioters storm the building he was\u00a0sworn to protect.",
  "date": "February 23, 2021 2:08pm EST",
  "text": "'Yes, I do sir,' Sund responded. 'I certainly do regret resigning. I love this agency. I love the women and men of this agency and I regret the day I left.' During a separate line of questioning by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., Sund and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving also could not agree on when National Guard assistance was requested. Sund said he submitted the request at 1:09 p.m. on Jan. 6. But Irving insisted he did not receive the request for National Guard support until after 2 p.m. while in former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger\u2019s office. When pressed, Irving said he took a call from Sund before while on the Congress floor.All three men resigned in the days after the insurrection. Sund and Irving did not concur on the timeline regarding the National Guard request before Blunt ran out of time for his questioning. Sen.Johnson, who was tapped next, suggested that phone records be dug up in the future.Earlier during his opening statement, Sund said the insurrection on Jan. 6 was a 'clear lack of intelligence information,' and was 'not poor planning' by the U.S. Capitol Police. He explained that the force relies on cooperation between difference intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Intelligence available before Jan. 6 suggested that the events would be similar to a previous Million MAGA event in December, which involved White supremacist groups, including the Proud Boys, and other extremist groups like Antifa and that those participating could become violent, Sund said. 'We had planned for possibility of violence and possibility of people being armed but not possibility of coordinated attacks,' Sund told members of Congress, explaining that rioters were equipped with their own radio system, planted pipe bombs, and had brought climbing gear and explosives to the Capitol. 'These criminals came prepared for war,' Sund said. Sund, Irving and Stenger also testified that they had not seen the FBI report of raw data that was released on eve on Jan. 5 that provided information on Jan. 6 event. Irving said a call between him, Stenger and Sund the night before suggested 'intelligence didn\u2019t warrant' National Guard.'The events of January 6th went beyond disobedience,' Stenger also said during his own remarks. 'This was a violent, coordinated attack where the loss of life could have been much worse.' Throughout the hearing, Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee testified that he was 'stunned' by the Army\u2019s response as Sund was pleading for National Guard response during the afternoon of Jan. 6. As calls from the Capitol grew more chaotic, Army officials said they did not deny the request but discussed concerns in deploying Guardsmen since they were not prepositioned in advance. Officials serving in the Pentagon at the time of the insurrection will testify next week about their response to the Capitol breach andallegations that they slow-walked National Guard approval, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., announced on Tuesday. Contee said Tuesday he wants the authority to change the mission of the DC National Guardfrom the Pentagon to the D.C. mayor. Furthermore, Sund argued that the FBI needs to broaden the extent of information it collects on domestic extremists.

  "description": "Host of CBS' \"The Late Show\" Stephen Colbert spent a segment of his show Monday evening addressing the recent arrests of his crew and production members in the Longworth House Office Building.",
  "date": "June 21, 2022 5:04am EDT",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The host opened the show by asking the audience about their weekends before joking, 'Well, I had an interesting one and some members of my staff had a memorable one.''The Capitol police were just doing their job, my staff was just doing their job, everyone was very professional, everyone was very calm,' the host continued. 'My staffers were detained, processed and released. A very unpleasant experience for my staff.'Among those arrested was Robert Smigel, the puppeteer for 'Triumph the Insult Comic Dog,' a character on CBS's 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.''After they\u2019d finished their interviews, [my staffers] were doing some last-minute puppetry and jokey make-em-ups in a hallway, when Triumph and my folks were approached and detained by Capitol Police,' Colbert said.He continued, 'A lot of paperwork for the Capitol police but a fairly simple story\u2026 until the next night when a couple of the TV people started claiming that my puppet squad had quote, \u2018committed insurrection\u2019 at the U.S. Capitol building.'Colbert claimed his staff was not in the main Capitol building, and he said he was 'shocked that he has to explain the difference, but an insurrection involves disrupting the lawful actions of Congress and howling for the blood of elected leaders \u2013 all to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.'He tagged the incident as 'first-degree puppetry,' then blamed former President Trump for the Jan. 6 capitol riot.Colbert accused journalists covering the story of looking for an excuse to talk about something other than the Jan. 6 hearings and said drawing an equivalence to the rioters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6 is a 'shameful and grotesque insult to the memory of everyone who died.'He said it 'obscenely trivializes the service and courage the Capitol police showed on that terrible day.' He joked that perhaps there was a vast conspiracy by his staffers to overthrow the government with a rubber rottweiler \u2013 a reference to the Triumph the Insult Comic Dog puppet.'Responding officers observed seven individuals, unescorted and without Congressional ID, in a sixth-floor hallway,' the police said in a statement. 'The building was closed to visitors, and these individuals were determined to be a part of a group that had been directed by the USCP to leave the building earlier in the day.'The Capitol Police said the individuals were charged with unlawful entry. 'This is an active criminal investigation, and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with the U.S. Attorney,' the USCP added.Earlier in the day, they conducted interviews with members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, including Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla, and Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., are now asking Capitol Police for more information about how the group was able to gain accesses to the House building."

  "description": "In a detailed letter addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said the\u00a0department \"did not fail\"\u00a0on Jan. 6, arguing that Capitol Police did everything it could with the intelligence available beforehand, but still did not expect a group of \"thousands of well-coordinated, well-equipped violent criminals\" to attack law enforcement at the Capitol building.",

  "text": "Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) joins Maria Bartiromo on \u2018Sunday Morning Futures.\u2019'There has been much conflicting information presented by various officials and the media regarding preparations and actions taken at the Capitol that day, and I would like to set the record straight from my perspective,' Sund said in the letter obtained by Fox News on Sunday.The letter was addressed to Pelosi, but was sent to other leaders like Sens. Chuck Schumer andMitch McConnell; Reps. Steny Hoyer and Kevin McCarthy also received the letter.Sund, who resigned after the insurrection, revealed that a number of those in the crowd, 'were wearing radio earpieces indicating a high level of coordination,' and many also carried, 'weapons, chemical munitions, protective equipment, explosives and climbing gear.'The letter addressed to Pelosi on Feb. 1claimed that the first 150 members of the National Guard were not sworn in on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 until about four and half hours after Sund\u2019s request for their support was approved by the Capitol Police Board.'What occurred on January 6th cannot be considered under any circumstances a protest, rally of civil disobedience. This was a well-planned, coordinated insurrection at the United States Capitol,' Sund wrote.'The USCP does not have the manpower, the training of the capabilities to handle an armed insurrection involving thousands of individuals bent on violence and destruction at all costs. Nevertheless, because of their bravery and professionalism in the face of this attack, USCP did not fail.'On Jan. 3, an internal intelligence assessment showed that members of the Proud Boys, White supremacist groups, Antifaand other extremist groups were expected to participate in the Jan. 6 event and that they may be inclined to become violent, Sund said.But though intelligence showed the Capitol building would be the target on Jan. 6, Sund said the event was expected to be similar to previouslarge protestsorganized by pro-Trump supporters on Nov. 14 and Dec. 12 in Washington, D.C. at the Supreme Court and adjacent Capitol grounds. Those MAGA eventsinvolved thousands of people but had a limited number amount of violence, injuries to officersand arrests, Sund said, adding thatat no point at either of those events did people attempt to storm the Supreme Court building.Sund provided a timeline of his attempts to get a request for National Guard support on Jan. 6. He said he reiterated his urgent request for National Guard support to help shore up the perimeter of the Capitol in a call at 2:28 p.m.,when Army Lt. General Walter Piatt allegedly stated, 'I don\u2019t like the visual of the National Guard standing a line with the Capitol in the background.'When Sund said having Capitol police officers relieved from other posts to respond to the Capitol was not an option and thatNational Guard was needed, House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving said he would need to run the request up the chain of command at the Pentagon.'The USCP needs more unilateral authority to implement its security planning and the ability to call in National Guard support when needed.Steps need to be taken to ensure National Guard's ability to support USCPis seamless in the future,' Sund wrote.He added, 'I also wish we had better intelligence and warnings as the possibility of this type of military-style armed insurrection. The entire intelligence community seems to have missed this.'Before the National Guard arrived, more than 1,700 police officers from 18 nearby jurisdictions convened at the Capitol.Sund said he pushed for expedited delivery of helmets ordered for officers before the inauguration, and approximately 104 helmets were delivered on Jan. 4 to protect officers from individuals who might be armed in the crowds expected on Jan. 6. Herecognizeda 'number of systems broke down' and that 'officials or officers who violated policies or directives, or even their oath, need to be held accountable.'About a month has passed since the insurrection, and heightened security measures set in place before the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 still remain, including an eight-foot, barbed wire fence that stands around the heavily fortified Capitol complex. In an appearance on 'Sunday Morning Futures,' Sen. Ron Johnson, who alongside Sen. Lindsey Graham, has requested information about the insurrection from the Senate Sergeant of Arms, said he appreciated Sund for sending the letter and providing more of an insight into who knew what that day. 'I actually appreciate what the former chief of police of Capitol Police, Steven Sund, sent in the letter. And he lays out the diligence that he undertook to provide security around the capital,' Johnson told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo. 'It seems like he took pretty reasonable precautions. He's obviously being one of the scapegoats here.''It's a month has gone by and we still don't know. And yet we have these eight-foot tall fences with concertina wire completely surrounding the Capitol,' he continued. 'We've been told they're going to be put in place since March at least. Listen, the Capitol is the people's house.'Johnson argued that Democrats are intentionally keeping the fencing around the Capitol to send a message that anyone who voted for Trump can be equated to a domestic terrorist. 'It shouldn't be barricaded unless there are some real threats that I'm not aware of that they're not telling us about. I think we ought to take that fencing down and return to asnormal of a position as possible,' Johnson said. 'I think the fencing is being remade, is remaining in place to send a signal, a narrative that seventy-four million Americans had voted for President Trump are dangerous to our democracy. They're all insurrectionists. And that's simply not the case.'Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

  "date": "August 1, 2022 6:27pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News State Department correspondent Rich Edson covers potential criminal charges against former President Trump in the wake of the January 6th committee and DOJ investigations on 'Special Report.'His prison sentence \u2014 seven years and three months \u2014 is two years more than the previous longest prison sentence for a Capitol riot defendant. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler had requested 15 years for Reffitt, calling him a domestic terrorist who wanted to physically remove and replace members of Congress.U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich rejected prosecutors' contention that an 'upward departure for terrorism' was warranted in Reffitt's case. It was the first time that prosecutors have requested that sentencing enhancement for a Jan. 6 case.Friedrich, however, questioned why Reffitt would merit the terrorism enhancement when many other rioters engaged in violence and made similarly disturbing threats.On Monday, Reffitt offered an expletive-laden apology to police officers, lawmakers and congressional staffers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6.Defense attorney Clinton Broden asked for Reffitt to be sentenced to no more than two years in prison. Broden noted that Reffitt didn't assault any law enforcement officers or enter the Capitol building.Videos captured the confrontation between outnumbered Capitol police officers and a mob of people, including Reffitt, who approached them on the west side of the Capitol.Reffitt was armed with a Smith & Wesson pistol in a holster on his waist, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing body armor and a helmet equipped with a video camera when he advanced on the officers, prosecutors said. He retreated after an officer pepper sprayed him in the face, but he waved on other rioters who ultimately breached the building, prosecutors said.The jury found him guilty of obstructing Congress' joint session, of interfering with police officers outside the Capitol and of threatening his two teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement.Reffitt's 19-year-old son, Jackson, testified that his father told him and his sister, then 16, that they would be traitors if they reported him to authorities and warned them that 'traitors get shot.'Reffitt lived with his wife and children in Wylie, Texas, a Dallas suburb. He drove to Washington, D.C., with Rocky Hardie, a fellow member of the Texas Three Percenters militia group.Hardie testified that both of them were armed with holstered handguns when they attended Trump's 'Stop the Steal' rally before the riot. Hardie also said Reffitt gave him two pairs of zip-tie cuffs in case they needed to detain anybody.Reffitt is one of seven Capitol riot defendants to get a jury trial so far. Jurors have unanimously convicted all seven of them on all counts in their respective indictments.More than 840 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. Over 340 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. More than 220 have been sentenced, with nearly half of them receiving terms of imprisonment. Approximately 150 others have trial dates stretching into 2023."

I say that while also expressing my support as an American citizen for peaceful protest in our country. I have fully supported all peaceful protests in America.

  "date": "June 22, 2021 9:48pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.A new select committee would put majority Democrats in charge of the investigation. More than three dozen Republicans in the House and seven Senate Republicans said they wanted to avoid a partisan probe, and they supported the legislation to form a commission, which would have been modeled after a similar panel that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Still, those numbers weren\u2019t strong enough to overcome GOP opposition in the Senate, where support from 1O Republicans is needed to pass most bills if all Democrats vote yes. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said he may hold a second vote after the legislation failed to advance last month, but there\u2019s no indication that Democrats can win the necessary support from three additional Republicans.Pelosi said earlier this month that the House 'can\u2019t wait any longer' and would proceed with a probe. She said then that she was considering a select committee or having an existing committee conduct the investigation.Many Republicans have made clear that they want to move on from the Jan. 6 attack, brushing aside the many unanswered questions about the insurrection, including how the government and law enforcement missed intelligence leading up to the rioting and the role of Trump before and during the insurrection.Some Republicans have gone so far as to downplay the violence, with one suggesting the rioters looked like tourists and another insisting that a woman, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the House chamber through a window was 'executed.'Last week, 21 Republicans voted against giving medals of honor to Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police to thank them for their service that day. Dozens of those officers suffered injuries, including chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones.Seven people died during and after the rioting, including Babbitt, three other Trump supporters who died of medical emergencies and two police officers who died by suicide in the days that followed. A third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes."

  "text": "Rep. Hank Johnson compared parents who protested at school board meetings to 'MAGA Republicans' who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 during a committee hearing.Instead of discussing potential coordination, Johnson attacked the parent protestors as 'MAGA extremists' and criticized Republican lawmakers for bringing up the topic.'Today, what we are seeing on this committee is an attempt by my friends on the other side of the aisle to continue demonizing school boards, local school boards, local school board members, school administrators, parents and teachers. These school board meetings have become a place where MAGA extremists go to disrupt based on false and deceptive information imparted to them by the former president and his MAGA extremist followers, deception about what\u2019s being taught to our children,' Johnson said.He added, 'It\u2019s really a travesty that we come today in Congress just a couple of months before a very important election that my MAGA supports on the other side of the aisle are intent on winning so they can take control of this body and then they will have the ability to harass and try to intimidate the administration with their oversight powers.'He later compared parents who protested school board meetings to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots'January 6, 2021, will never be forgotten, an infamous day in American history. MAGA Republicans descended upon the Capitol, engaged in an insurrection. They occupied the Capitol. Five people were killed, hundreds injured, including hundreds of Capitol Hill police officers attacked and bludgeoned. It was a day that we\u2019ll never forget,' the lawmaker said. 'And people on the local level at affected school board meetings, they won\u2019t forget the MAGA Republicans descending on their school board meetings after January 6, like January 6, disrupting meetings. It was a coordinated attack happening across the country. Americans won\u2019t forget about it. School board members, teachers, administrators, subjected to violence, threats of violence, harassment, intimidation.''And in response to that, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to the Biden Administration seeking federal help. Things had gotten so far out of hand. And by the way, there is not one scintilla of evidence, either direct or indirect, that there was any coordination between the Biden Administration and the National School Boards Association that caused that letter to be sent seeking federal assistance,' Johnson said.However, he later admitted that the memo was 'indicating that there was going to be some coordination between the federal government and local governments to maintain order at school board meetings.'Since President Biden\u2019s condemnation of 'MAGA Republicans' as a threat to democracy, Democrats, including the president, have been vague on who falls under that category, instead pointing to broader issues such as pro-life policies.Lindsay Kornick is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

  "text": "\u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 host discusses the media\u2019s response to Jan. 6 on the eve of its one-year anniversary.When the nation was wracked by unimaginable loss in years past, that\u2019s how we remember it: 40,000 casualties at Gettysburg. 2,400 lost at Pearl Harbor. Nearly 3,000 Americans dead on 9/11.But this is a new time, a different age. Those antiquated metrics won\u2019t work as we observe a moment of silence for the fallen of January 6th.It\u2019s about feelings \u2014 how the survivors feel, especially the reporters who survived. The feelings of reporters in Washington matter a great deal in America. They certainly matter a lot more than how you feel at the moment. How you feel, as you\u2019ve probably realized by now, is totally irrelevant to anyone. No one cares. But the journalists of Capitol Hill? They do care. And they\u2019re upset. Many still haven\u2019t recovered from what they saw that day. As they lie down to sleep at night, the horrible images replay on a loop on the back their eyelids: The deafening thunder of cannon volleys. The smoke from the remorseless artillery fire, blotting out the sun. The screams of the mortallywounded calling out for their loved ones, echoing like some demonic soundtrack against the walls of the speaker\u2019s lobby. Hell in a very small place.Unless you were there, you cannot possibly understand what it was like. Imagine the Tet Offensive, plus Fallujah, plus the night before Thanksgiving at Whole Foods. On Jan. 6th, you couldn\u2019t tell who the enemy was, unless you looked down and saw they\u2019d bought their shoes at Walmart. Then you knew. But otherwise, it was the fog of war, my friends.Kasie Hunt was there that day. Hunt is now something called the 'chief national affairs analyst' over at CNN. As a veteran of the siege of the Capitol, Hunt took to Twitter today to give hope to her fellow survivors. 'Tomorrow is going to be a tough one for those of us who were there or had loved ones in the building. Thinking of all of you and finding strength knowing I\u2019m not alone in this\u2026.#January6th'That was just a tweet. But, someday, you\u2019ve got to believe, because this is a hopeful country, Hunt and her fellow survivors of the insurrection massacre of Jan. 6 will come together in some more formal way: Annual reunions, held in the shadow of Washington\u2019s certain-to-be-built Jan. 6 memorial, the one they\u2019ll have to bulldoze the Washington Monument to construct. Hunt and graying grizzled veterans of the Washington Post and Bloomberg News, and Politico, and The Daily Beast and the Atlantic Magazine will raise their White Claws as one, and remember how they cheated death that terrible day.But of course, Merrick Garland never speaks alone. The chorus always joins him, because they always move as one.Arrested for what? I guess there wasn\u2019t room in the tweet to explain. But just arrested. Bad people should be arrested, that\u2019s the point. What\u2019s interesting is there are a lot of actual criminals who got no space in the Garland speech.Garland made no mention at all of the 'pipe bomber' of Jan. 5. \u2013 We\u2019re observing the anniversary of the pipe bomber right now. That individual was caught \u2013 we would say man but we don\u2019t want to get to specific in the current environment - on surveillance tape. He used his phone several times. That\u2019s all traceable. Where is that person? But Merrick Garland didn't mention it. Here's what he focused on instead:What are they busy doing? Well, they\u2019re busy repeating the talking points Merrick Garland has prepared for them. Let\u2019s be honest, everyone who\u2019s conservative appreciates Ted Cruz. You may not like him, but you\u2019ve got to appreciate him. He\u2019s legitimately smart, and he\u2019s one of the more articulate people to serve in Congress, maybe the most articulate. He doesn\u2019t use a single word by accident. Every word Ted Cruz uses is used intentionally, he\u2019s a lawyer."

'Dwight Eisenhower during World War II, made sure all the Holocaust camps were filmed. So we've got the film footage, so we're combating the conspiracy theorists, deniers and some, you know, Trumpeteers.''But what my worry is what do we call this and make sure we honor this day, this dark-stained day every year. So we've got to keep saying January 6th. I think it is like December 7th Pearl Harbor it is like the 9/11 tragedy, and we also need to not be afraid to call the Trump Insurrection of January 6th because in the end, all roads to what went wrong that day lead to Donald Trump's ill behavior, his anti-democratic stance he took, the Big Lie, after the presidential election tallies came in. And Joe Biden had won by millions of votes,' Brinkley said.The liberal TV pundit went on say Jan. 6 'has to be a crusade that's every day,' citing an editorial from the New York Times declaring 'every day is Jan. 6.''It's not just about voting in the United States, but we have to make sure our elections aren't sabotaged or that there's not subversion, there's not sorts or wild-eyed gerrymandering going on behind our backs,' Brinkley said. 'Right now, our secretaries of states in different states are under attack, the death threats going on of public officials. So we are in a real neo-civil war, and it's a battle between democracy versus a kind of nativist authoritarianism.'Brinkley went to seemingly endorse the Democrat-led effort to federalize elections, noting how President Biden and Vice President Harris are set to promote the John Lewis Voting Rights Act next week in Atlanta.'We've got to secure free and fair elections. That's the heart and soul of our democracy. That's been our great export. We are the world's oldest democracy. And we don't defend that, we're in dark, troubled times,' Brinkley added.Harris similarly invoked 9/11 and Pearl Harbor during her speech commemorating the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot.'Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who has lived through them where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault,' Harris said. 'Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars but a place in our collective memory; December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001, and January 6, 2021.'Joseph A.

  "text": "Tucker examines the disproportionate punishment given to those in the Capitol on Jan 6 and those participating in BLM protestsWe still don\u2019t know who shot Ashli Babbitt, or why. No one will tell us. But then, when you\u2019re fighting insurrectionists, you don\u2019t have to explain yourself. You just hyperventilate about QAnon, and then you do whatever you want. When a group of sad, disenfranchised people who have been left out of the modern economy show up at your office, you don\u2019t have to listen to their complaints, not for a second. Why would you? You thought listening to people\u2019s complaints was democracy? No, these people threaten democracy. You can even shoot one of them, if you want, and get away with it. Killing people without explaining yourself is an established part of counterinsurgency. If you don\u2019t believe it, check out what happened in the Second World War.Until late last month, a man called Michael Sherwin worked for the administration as a prosecutor in Washington. Sherwin bragged that his office rounded up about 400 people who were in or near the Capitol on Jan.6. You may be wondering if 400 people really committed crimes that day. It depends how you define 'crime.' Here's Michael Sherwin's definition:So now it\u2019s clear. It wasn\u2019t that 400 people broke actual laws. No, their crime, said the federal prosecutor, was 'thumbing their noses at the public,' meaning the Democratic Party. It wasn\u2019t 'insurrection.' It was showing disrespect to Joe Biden and his enforcers like Michael Sherwin, and that can\u2019t happen.That\u2019s why Michael Sherwin decided to use 'shock and awe' \u2014 to teach them a permanent lesson about expressing their political opinions. As Sherwin explained, 'the scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably DOJ history.'And he may be right. How big and how serious is this investigation into those insurrectionists? So serious that the FBIhas stopped investigating other crimes, and not minor crimes.So, in order to send a message to people with unacceptable political ideas in Washington, D.C., we\u2019re not going after people who sell fentanyl, a drug that has killed more than100,000 Americans, or child pornographers. They won\u2019t be punished. So who are these people who are being perused in lieu of tracking down fentanyl dealers and child pornographers? Who\u2019s experiencing the Biden administration's'shock and awe'?'Griffith walked into the U.S. Capitol building through the open doors on January 6, telling the agents he did not see any police officers as he entered the building. He then went into a nearby office where he 'interacted with some individuals' before exiting the building. However, he reentered the U.S. Capitol Building again a short time later, where he meandered through the hallways and took a few photos.'For that act of terrorism, Anthony Griffith faces seven years in prison. Prosecutor Michael Sherwin is fine with that. At one point in his interview with '60 Minutes,' Sherwin was asked about bringing sedition charges against the people he arrests, the people who meandered. Sure, he replied. Why not?Meandering is sedition, says Michael Sherwin.Just for reference, federal prosecutors aren\u2019t supposed to reveal themselves as partisan lunatics on television. Sherwin\u2019s comments were so grotesquely out of line that a federal judge appointed by Barack Obama, Amit Mehta, said he was considering issuing a gag order to make Michael Sherwin be quiet. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals -- the most powerful appellate court in the country -- just ordered the DOJ to start distinguishing between actual criminals, and people who walked through open doors inside the Capitol building.That ruling came after the DOJ tried to convince a judge that two defendants -- Lisa Eisenhart and her son, Eric Munchel - should face indefinite detention. Neither Lisa Eisenhart nor her son damaged any property at the Capitol or committed any violence. They just walked in to what we used to refer to as the People\u2019s House.And yet, somehow Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ convinced a trial judge that Lisa Eisenhart was a 'threat to our Republic,' and that her son was a 'would-be martyr.' Keep in mind, these are people whose only crime was trespassing in the Capitol. We\u2019re not endorsing that, but some perspective please.It took a ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to bring some perspective.'Two individuals who did not engage in any violence and who were not involved in planning or coordinating the activities \u2014 seemingly would pose little threat,' the appellate panel wrote. Yeah, seemingly.But the judges still didn't release Eric Munchel or Lisa Eisenhart. That's how much power these prosecutors have. They can keep you in prisoneven when a three-judge appellate panel concludes there's no reason for you to be in prison.That's probably why prosecutors still haven't, as of tonight, released a man called Jacob Chansely, otherwise known as the 'Chewbacca Guy.' Like Eric Munchel and Lisa Eisenhart, Jacob Chansely isn't accused of committing any act of violence. He's not accused of breaking any property. What exactly did he do? We can answer that question. Video shows him walking through the Senate chamber.'Chewbacca Guy' is still in jail. He\u2019ll be there indefinitely. Before you shrug that off, think about what that\u2019s actually like. You don\u2019t want to think about it.A number of people arrested on Jan.6are still rotting in the D.C.municipal lockup, one of the foulest detention centers in the country. It's atruly repulsive, mismanaged place. Ask anyone from Washington, D.C. what they would do not to be thrown in the D.C. jail. It\u2019s that bad. Some say they\u2019ve been beaten, not surprisingly, by guards there. Lawyers for one, a man called Ryan Samsel, sayhe was beaten so badly, he has a skull fracture and is now blind in one eye.How many Antifa rioters or BLM vandals can say that? Did they lose their eyesight from being beaten in jail? Well, as a group, they didn't spend much time in jail. Most were spring on bail immediately, which politicians like Kamala Harris helped them pay.Last summer, for example, authorities released a terrorism suspect in Oklahoma called Eric Christopher Ruffin, after Black Lives Matter posted his $750,000 bond. According to authorities, Ruffin, 'encouraged others to burn an Oklahoma County sheriff's van and an Oklahoma City bail bonds business May 30. The van was destroyed. CJ's Bail Bonds had $8,850 in damage from broken windows.'But Eric Christopher Ruffin went home, and he went home for one reason: Unlike the Chewbacca Guy, he didn't upset the people in charge. He didn't walk in their 'sacred chamber' and talk about 'liberty and rights.' He just tried to vaporize some police vehicles,and that\u2019s exactly what our political class wanted him to do. So he\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s fine. He hasn\u2019t lost his eyesight getting a beating in jail.This kind of thing, unequal treatment under the law, is on stark display across the country right now. We could spend an hour giving you examples, but here are a couple:The suspect, Darlene Montoya, was in jail for a serious crime -- she'd been accused of assault with a deadly weapon. But, is that really as serious as meandering through the Capitol building? No, of course not, it\u2019s not 'insurrection.' So, Darlene Montoya got to walk out of jail and find someone else to hurt.Meanwhile, in Detroit, a judge decided to release four felons who had been convicted of criminal sexual assault, and another 14 people who had committed assault. The judge claimed the coronavirus justified their release. According to prosecutors, one of those felons went out and raped three women at knifepoint.Why haven\u2019t you read this? No one covers any of this because it happens too often to notice.Last month, however, one of these murders was caught on video. It was impossible to ignore. Two teenage girls -- one 15, and one 13 -- carjacked and killed a Pakistani immigrant driver called Mohammad Anwar. He has kids, and was just trying to work, trying to make a buck. As Mohammad Anwar lay dying on the sidewalk, one of the girls complained that the real crisis was she couldn\u2019t find her cellphone.You kill a guy who\u2019s just trying to work, and then you can\u2019t even be bothered to notice as he dies on the sidewalk because you\u2019re worried about your phone. There\u2019s a big problem with these girls. They\u2019re young, for sure, but they did something awful.The biggest threat to you, if you\u2019re an autocrat, is people who mock you, and don\u2019t take you seriously, and sneer at you. You want them in prison, and autocrats are doing just that."

  "date": "June 13, 2022 9:18pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News senior political analyst reveals the ultimate goal of the Capitol riot probe on 'Special Report.''Democrats are desperate to change the narrative of a failing nation, without making mention of the havoc and death caused by the Radical Left just months earlier,' Trump said. 'Make no mistake, they control the government. They own this disaster. They are hoping that these hearings will somehow alter their failing prospects.'Trump used much of the 12-page document to rehash his unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 Presidential Election was supposedly 'Rigged and Stolen.''Politicians from both parties, but mostly the Democrats, worked in conjunction with corporate elitists to strip Americans of our right to elect our own leaders,' Trump said.He added: 'The Establishment is holding on as tightly as they can to their power as they watch it slip from their grasp. Our country is in a nosedive. Americans are struggling to fill their gas tanks, feed their babies, educate their children, hire employees, order supplies, protect our border from invasion, and a host of other tragedies that are 100% caused by Democrats who obtained power through a rigged election, and the people of our country are both angry and sad.'The rebuttal came on the second day of a House panel investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021. The nine-member panel is trying to make the case that Trump, and those allies who helped him, were deliberately lying as he pushed election falsehoods in the weeks ahead of the violent insurrection, that the rioters who broke into the Capitol that day and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden's victory were echoing Trump's lies that he, not Biden, had rightfully won the election."

  "text": "President Donald Trump sits down for a one on one interview with Steve Hilton on 'The Next Revolution''So, you know, that was a big mistake,' he said.Pelosi\u2019s office and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to an email inquiry from Fox News.Trump told Steve Hilton, the show\u2019s host, that he 'hated' to see what unfolded on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol. Much of what led to the riot at the Capitol remains a mystery.Last week, former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told a bipartisan Senate panel that he didn\u2019t know then that his officers had received a report from the FBI\u2019s field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could bring 'war' to Washington the following day.The head of the FBI\u2019s office in Washington has said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through a joint terrorism task force.Sund and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving also could not agree on when National Guard assistance was requested.Sund said he submitted the request at 1:09 p.m. on Jan. 6. But Irving insisted he did not receive the request for National Guard support until after 2 p.m. while in former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger\u2019s office. When pressed, Irving said he took a call from Sund before while on the Congress floor.Sund and Irving disagreed on when the National Guard was called and on requests for the guard beforehand. Sund said he spoke to both Stenger and Irving about requesting the National Guard in the days before the riot, and that Irving said he was concerned about the 'optics' of having them present. Irving denied that, saying Sund\u2019s account was 'categorically false.'Pelosisaid the commission will 'investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex \u2026 and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.'Earlier this month, Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, told Fox News\u2019 'Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo' that Trump issued a 'direct order' to have up to 10,000 troops ready. Trump told Hilton that contrary to reports that have been circulating, he was not watching the riot in real-time and only began following the events later on when he heard about the chaos.Trump said he hated to see the riot but compared it to unrest that occurred in cities like Portland and Seattle.'I hate to see any of that, but it is a double standard,' he said."

  "title": "Pelosi to form select committee to investigate Jan. 6 Capitol riot",
  "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democratic colleagues on Tuesday that she is creating a new committee to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a person familiar with her remarks.",
  "date": "June 22, 2021 10:19pm EDT",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The new committee comes after Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would form a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the attack by former President Donald Trump's supporters. Pelosi said earlier this month that the House would step up investigations of the riot, in which a violent mob overran police, broke into the building and hunted for lawmakers to try to stop the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.The new select committee would put majority Democrats in charge of the investigation. More than three dozen Republicans in the House and seven Senate Republicans said they wanted to avoid a partisan probe, and they supported the legislation to form a commission, which would have been modeled after a similar panel that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks.But those numbers weren\u2019t strong enough to overcome GOP opposition in the Senate, where support from 1O Republicans is needed to pass most bills if all Democrats vote yes as a bloc. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said he may hold a second vote after the legislation failed to advance last month, but there\u2019s no indication that Democrats can win the necessary support from three additional Republicans.'We can\u2019t wait any longer,' Pelosi said June 15. 'We will proceed.'Many Republicans have made clear that they want to move on from the Jan. 6 attack, brushing aside the many unanswered questions about the insurrection, including how the government and law enforcement missed intelligence leading up to the rioting and the role of Trump before and during the insurrection.Some Republicans have gone so far as to downplay the violence, with one suggesting the rioters looked like tourists and another insisting that a woman, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the House chamber through a window was 'executed.'Last week, 21 Republicans voted against giving medals of honor to Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police to thank them for their service that day. Dozens of those officers suffered injuries, including chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones.Seven people died during and after the rioting, including Babbitt, three other Trump supporters who died of medical emergencies and two police officers who died by suicide in the days that followed. A third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes."

The goal of the rally wasto pressure Congress to vote against certifying the results of the election for JoeBiden.'We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting so that ... we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside,' Alexander said in the now-deleted video that was archived and reported by Jason Paladino, an investigator at the Project On Government Oversight.Biggs said in a statement Friday that he has 'no idea' why Alexander would make such claims, insisting that 'all of the allegations are false.'Biggs said'many on the left' have accused him ofplaying a role inplanning and funding the rally and insurrection --even leading reconnaissance tours of the Capitol prior to the riot.Even after the violent storming of the Capitol-- whichdisruptedthe joint session of Congress and forcedlawmakers into hiding --Biggs and Gosar refused to certify Arizona's 11 electoral votes for Biden.Biggs denied having had any contact with Alexandereither by'phone, text, social media or email.' He added in his statement that the 'lies' have 'resulted in death threats against my family and me, as well as several other conservative Members of Congress who\u2019ve been similarly defamed.'Alexander could not be immediately reached for comment.Biggs has been castigated by his own family -- his two brothers lambasted him over his efforts to cast doubt about Biden's victory in the election. Thesiblings wrote in a letter to the Arizona Republic that Biggs is 'at least partially to blame' for the insurrection that left five people dead.The state GOP tweeted:'He is. Are you?'Democrats have urged FBI Director Christopher Wray and Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to investigate the role of elected officials in the uprising, including Biggs, Gosar, Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem and former state Rep. Anthony Kern.Agovernment watchdog group has urged the House Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate Biggs and other lawmakers for possibleinvolvement inthe insurrection."

  "text": "President Donald Trump sits down for a one on one interview with Steve Hilton on 'The Next Revolution''So, you know, that was a big mistake,' he said.Pelosi\u2019s office and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to an email inquiry from Fox News.Trump told Steve Hilton, the show\u2019s host, that he 'hated' to see what unfolded on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol. Much of what led to the riot at the Capitol remains a mystery.Last week, former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told a bipartisan Senate panel that he didn\u2019t know then that his officers had received a report from the FBI\u2019s field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could bring 'war' to Washington the following day.The head of the FBI\u2019s office in Washington has said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through a joint terrorism task force.Sund and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving also could not agree on when National Guard assistance was requested.Sund said he submitted the request at 1:09 p.m. on Jan. 6. But Irving insisted he did not receive the request for National Guard support until after 2 p.m. while in former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger\u2019s office. When pressed, Irving said he took a call from Sund before while on the Congress floor.Sund and Irving disagreed on when the National Guard was called and on requests for the guard beforehand. Sund said he spoke to both Stenger and Irving about requesting the National Guard in the days before the riot, and that Irving said he was concerned about the 'optics' of having them present. Irving denied that, saying Sund\u2019s account was 'categorically false.'Pelosisaid the commission will 'investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex \u2026 and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.'Earlier this month, Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, told Fox News\u2019 'Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo' that Trump issued a 'direct order' to have up to 10,000 troops ready. Trump told Hilton that contrary to reports that have been circulating, he was not watching the riot in real-time and only began following the events later on when he heard about the chaos.Trump said he hated to see the riot but compared it to unrest that occurred in cities like Portland and Seattle.'I hate to see any of that, but it is a double standard,' he said."

The intel in advance was pretty specific, and it was enough in our view for law enforcement to have done a better job operationalizing a secure perimeter,' Heaphy said.'Law enforcement had a very direct role in contributing to really the failures, the security failures that led to the violence,' he continued.Dilanian reported that 'people familiar with the committee\u2019s work tell NBC News members downplayed that finding because they wanted to keep the focus on former President Trump'.

  "text": "Fox News host Jesse Watters and Rep. Rodney Davis provide insight on staffers of 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' arrested at Capitol Hill on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'Late Thursday, the individuals, including 'Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog' puppeteer Robert Smigel \u2013 a frequent guest of Colbert's -- were not credentialed to be walking around without an escort, a House Republican source told Fox News. Others arrested included Colbert writer Josh Comers and associate producer Allison Martinez.The group was cleared into the complex by staffers for Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., and House January 6 Committee Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif.The group reportedly banged on doors of several Republican offices \u2013 including that of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Lauren Boebert of Colorado -- as they allegedly filmed a skit for Colbert's 'Late Show' program that was to center around the January 6 hearings.Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill, the ranking member on the House Committee on Administration \u2013 which has jurisdiction over the Capitol Police and House chamber operations \u2013 told 'Jesse Watters Primetime' Friday he will demand answers when Congress returns to session next week.Earlier in the day Thursday, the Colbert group was milling around an area of the Cannon House Office Building being used for media staging during the January 6 Committee hearings, after reportedly being helped in by members of Schiff's team.Davis said they were later ejected by members of the press, who had them escorted out.'It's my understanding they were offered a way back into the House office buildings by a staffer for [Auchincloss],' he added, as they traveled to Longworth, where Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert's office is located.Davis noted the only individuals ultimately arrested by Capitol Police for illegally touring House buildings were Smigel and those working for Colbert, not those accompanying Loudermilk.A House aide also pointed out the arrests came on the 50th anniversary of the infamous break-in of the Democratic National Committee's then-headquarters at the Watergate complex on the other side of Washington.In total, nine individuals, including Colbert senior producer Jake Plunkett, reportedly were taken into custody and spent one night in jail.In response, McCarthy pulled his entire slate of appointees, and characterized both the process and the committee as a farce. Later, Reps. Elizabeth Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., were separately seated without McCarthy's blessing.Loudermilk, the Republican lawmaker under fire for giving the January 5, 2021 tour, recently rebuffed claims he was involved in or sanctioned any nefarious behavior.House January 6 Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi countered that the behavior of the folks on Loudermilk's tour 'raise[d] concerns about their activity and intent.'But, Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger recently wrote in a letter to Davis his department 'do[es] not consider any of the activities we observed as suspicious.'Loudermilk reacted on social media, writing that the 'truth will always prevail' and calling accusations about him from Thompson and others 'baseless.''What the Capitol Police said doesn't fit the narrative that the January 6 committee wants to come up with,' he told Fox News.Charles Creitz is a reporter forFox News Digital.He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.Charles covers media, politics and breaking news, and has covered the annual CPAC conference for Fox News Digital.Charles is a Pennsylvania native and graduated from Temple University with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism.

Caldwell allegedly made arrangements for other Oath Keepers to stay in a Virginia hotel, reportedly writing on Facebook: 'This is a good location and would allow us to hunt at night if we wanted to.'He references another alleged Oath Keepers leader\u2019s potential 'call to arms,' and adds: 'This is one we are doing on our own,' according to the affidavit.Just hours after the insurrection, Caldwell purportedly wrote in a Facebook message: 'Us storming the castle. Please share ... I am such an instigator!''Proud boys scuffled with cops and drove them inside to hide. Breached the doors. One guy made it all the way to the house floor, another to Pelosi\u2019s office,' he wrote in a different missive. 'A good time.'But his messages didn\u2019t stop there, according to authorities.'We need to do this at the local level,' he allegedly wrote in a second message less than a minute later. 'We need to do this at the local level. Lets (s.i.c) storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!'Sources told Fox News he was charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the U.S. government. Court papers show he was also charged with obstruction of an official proceeding; knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; and violent entry or disorderly conduct.Caldwell is believed to be the first rioter hit with conspiracy charges. He could not be reached despite several attempts by Fox News.Among the hundreds who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 were eight to 10 people wearing 'paramilitary equipment' and clothing that identified them as members of the Oath Keepers, authorities said. They moved 'in an organized and practiced fashion and force[d] their way to the front of the crowd gathered around a door to the U.S. Capitol,' court papers state.Two of those members allegedly include Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl.Watkins and Crowl, both from Ohio, are being held at a county jail in Dayton, after being arrested Monday. Federal documents identify them as members of the Ohio State Regular Militia, dues-paying members of the Oath Keepers.Watkins, a 38-year-old self-described commanding officer of the Ohio State Regular Militia, posted video and comments on Jan. 6 on the Parler social media site, investigators said.In one instance, she posted a picture of herself and included the caption, 'Me before forcing entry into the Capitol Building.'Watkins also reportedly posted that entry was forced through the back door of the Capitol.They are amongmore than 125 peoplearrested so far on charges related to the Jan. 6violent insurrection, which led to the deaths of a Capitol police officer and four others.Stephanie Pagones is a Digital Reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

'All who participated in that insurrection, I think it can be called, must be held responsible.'Ayres said he has lost friends, family and a job after he joined the Jan. 6 attack.'I pray every day for the officers that are struggling with this, the families that lost their loved ones,' Ayres said. 'I just hope one day I can wake up and not have to live with it every day.'Prosecutors recommended sentencing Ayres to 60 days of incarceration, one year of supervised release and 60 hours of community service. Ayres' lawyer, Eugene Ohm, sought a sentence of probation without any jail time.Ayres, 41, pleaded guilty in June to one count of disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in prison. He wasn't accused of engaging in any violence or property damage.Ayres was charged with Matthew Perna, a friend from Pennsylvania who joined him in Washington. They attended the Jan. 6 'Stop the Steal' rally, where then-President Donald Trump addressed a crowd of supporters. Then they joined the mob's assault on the Capitol, entering the building through the Senate Wing doors.Perna died in February. He had pleaded guilty to riot-relayed charges in December and was scheduled to be sentenced in March. A filing notifying the court of Perna\u2019s death doesn\u2019t specify a cause, but Ayres' attorney said Perna 'took his own life largely because of the pressures of this case.''Mr. Ayres thinks of Mr. Perna, who conveyed to him that he felt responsible that Mr. Ayres had been charged, every day. Mr. Ayres wonders whether and to what extent Mr. Ayres\u2019 circumstances contributed to Mr. Perna\u2019s depression,' Ohm wrote.Two attorneys who represented Perna didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Ayres was employed as a supervisor for a cabinet manufacturer when he was arrested at his home in Warren, Ohio, less than three weeks after the Capitol attack. His employer fired him.During a July 12 hearing before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, Ayres testified that he felt as if Trump had called him to Washington that day. He said he believed that Trump would join them at the Capitol and held out hope that the 2020 presidential election results could be overturned in favor of the Republican incumbent.'I felt like I had like horse blinders on. I was locked in the whole time,' Ayres said.Ayres told committee members that he and others decided to leave the Capitol right after Trump tweeted at 4:17 p.m. for his supporters to go home.In a court filing accompanying his guilty plea, Ayres agreed he stayed in the Capitol for roughly 10 minutes. But his testimony about Trump\u2019s tweet indicates he actually remained in the building for approximately 90 minutes, according to prosecutors.At a separate hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden sentenced a former U.S. Army reservist to four years in prison for storming the Capitol, according to a Justice Department news release. Prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of six years and six months for Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, whom they described as a Nazi sympathizer.At least 880 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes.

  "text": "Fox News senior political analyst examines the role of the Jan 6 committee's upcoming hearing in response to the Capitol riot on 'Special Report.' But with the hearing expected to include video of interviews with top Trump officials and potentially family members, created with the assistance of a former ABC News president, the committee believes it can do just that.'The vast majority of the material you will see \u2026 is previously unseen,' a select committee aide said Wednesday. 'Whether it is recording video or audio of witnesses we've interviewed, whether it is records that we've obtained over the course of our investigation.Thursday's hearing is expected to be just one of several televised hearings from the Jan. 6 committee, with the next already announced for Monday.A select committee aide said the Thursday event will serve as an 'opening statement' to grab Americans' attention and to preview subsequent hearings.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., will lead a press conference Thursday morning about the committee. That event follows several national media interviews, media calls and other events at which House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.; Republican Study Committee Chair Jim Banks, R-Ind.; and others attacked the committee throughout the week.'I am working closely with President Trump, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan and my colleaguesto help lead House Republicans in pushing back against lame-duck Speaker Pelosi's shampolitical witch hunt,' Stefanik told Fox News Digital.She and other Republicans are making a variety of arguments in opposition to the committee.'We should study the events that led up to it. Why the Capitol was left unsecured on Jan. 6 when there was intelligence dating back before Jan. 6 something was going to happen,' Banks said in an interview with Fox News Digital.But those supportive of the committee say it is taking Capitol security into account. It has a separate investigative team dedicated to security failures. Republicans are just using that point to deflect from Trump's false claims the election was stolen and alleged culpability in the attack, committee supporters say.Thursday's hearing will come after months of the committee conducting interviews, depositions and subpoenaing more than 1,000 people and gathering more than 140,000 documents.While much of the grisly footage of smoke filling Capitol hallways and Trump supporters beating police officers is familiar to Americans, the interview and deposition footage may be the newest look for most viewers.'As much as certain Republicans attempt to say the committee is illegitimate, a sham and political, those claims will not hold a lot of weight when the committee shares what it knows, shares the truth and shares the facts,' a person close to the committee told Fox News.Tyler Olson is a for Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C."

Someone was able to save the flag from the rioters, KIRO reported.Fleetwood told KIRO the city planned to ask the members of the homeless encampment that took root late last year to move 25 feet away from the building after several issues, including harassment of county employees and several fires.'We seek a peaceful end to this encampment and if there is confrontation, we will not be the aggressors,' he said.He added the city is giving those in the encampment services and supplies and asking them to leave voluntarily.The rioters also reportedly grew hostile toward local journalists who they accused of invading their privacy.One radio reporter said the rioters stole his microphone, spray-painted him, threw hot chocolate on him and tried to take his other equipment, including his iPad. He said the rioters had shouted that he was taking 'unauthorized' photos of the protest.The Herald reported its journalists moved away for safety reasons as they saw other reporters being harassed as well as an official with HomesNOW!, which advocates for homeless people."

  "description": "The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has agreed to defer its attempt to get hundreds of pages of records from the Trump administration, holding off at the request of the Biden White House.",
  "date": "December 29, 2021 11:48am EST",
  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Trump is appealing to the Supreme Court to try to block the National Archives and Records Administration, which maintains custody of the documents from his time in office, from giving them to the committee.The agreement to keep some Trump-era records away from the committee is memorialized in a Dec. 16 letter from the White House counsel's office. It mostly shields records that do not involve the events of Jan. 6 but were covered by the committee's sweeping request for documents from the Trump White House about the events of that day.Dozen of pages created Jan. 6 don't pertain to the assault on the Capitol. Other documents involve sensitive preparations and deliberations by the National Security Council. Biden's officials were worried that if those pages were turned over to Congress, that would set a troublesome precedent for the executive branch, no matter who is president.Still other documents are highly classified and the White House asked Congress to work with the federal agencies that created them to discuss their release.'The documents for which the Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request do not appear to bear on the White House\u2019s preparations for or response to the events of January 6, or on efforts to overturn the election or otherwise obstruct the peaceful transfer of power,' White House deputy counsel Jonathan Su wrote in one of two letters to the committee obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.Su wrote that for the committee, withholding the documents 'should not compromise its ability to complete its critical investigation expeditiously.'Committee spokesman Tim Mulvey said: 'The committee has agreed to defer action on certain records as part of the accommodations process, as was the case with an earlier tranche of records. The Select Committee has not withdrawn its request for these records and will continue to engage with the executive branch to ensure the committee gets access to all the information relevant to our probe.'For the last several months the National Archives has been transmitting tranches of documents to the White House and to lawyers for Trump to determine whether they contain any privileged information. Trump has raised both broad objections to the release of the documents as well as specific concerns about particular documents.The National Archives has said that the records Trump wants to block include presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts, handwritten notes 'concerning the events of January 6' from the files of former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and 'a draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity.'Biden has repeatedly rejected Trump's claims of executive privilege over those documents, including in a letter sent Dec. 23 regarding about 20 pages of documents.'The President has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified,' White House counsel Dana Remus reiterated in the latest letter.Trump has taken to the courts to block the document releases. A federal appeals court ruled this month against Trump, and he has filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, though the high court has yet to decide whether to take up the case.Judge Patricia Millett, writing for the court in the Dec. 9 opinion, said Congress had a 'uniquely vital interest' in studying the events of Jan. 6 and Biden had made a 'carefully reasoned' determination that the documents were in the public interest and that executive privilege should therefore not be invoked. Trump also failed to show any harm that would occur from the release of the sought-after records, Millett wrote.'On the record before us, former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden\u2019s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents,' the opinion stated."

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered Williams be taken into custody after the jury delivered its verdict.Williams later bragged online that she stole Pelosi\u2019s gavel, laptop and hard drives and that she 'gave the electronic devices, or attempted to give them, to unspecified Russian individuals,' prosecutors said in a June 2022 court filing.'To date, neither the laptop nor the gavel has been recovered,' they added.A witness described as a former romantic partner of Williams told the FBI that she intended to send the stolen laptop or hard drive to a friend in Russia who planned to sell it to Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service. But the witness said Williams kept the device or destroyed it when the transfer fell through, according to an FBI agent's affidavit.Williams denied stealing the laptop when the FBI questioned her. She claimed her ex-boyfriend 'made up' the allegation, prosecutors said.Before she left the Capitol, Williams joined other rioters in pushing against police officers trying to clear the building's Rotunda. Police body camera captured the confrontation, as Williams encouraged other rioters to 'keep pushing,' and 'push, push, push.'Williams was wearing a shirt bearing the message, 'I\u2019m with groyper,' when she entered the Capitol. The term 'groyper' refers to followers of 'America First' movement leader Nick Fuentes, who has used his online platform to spew antisemitic and white supremacist rhetoric.Other followers of Fuentes have been charged with Jan. 6-related crimes, including former UCLA student Christian Secor, 24, of Costa Mesa, California. Secor, who was waving an 'America First' flag when he entered the Capitol, was sentenced last month to three years and six months in prison.Williams' online footprint also included material associated with 'accelerationism,' a violent ideology that asserts 'Western governments are corrupt and unsalvageable, and therefore the best thing a person can do is accelerate their collapse by sowing social chaos and generating political conflict,' prosecutors said.In December 2020, Williams attended at least two rallies protesting the outcome of the presidential election. Both rallies featured speeches by Fuentes.'Her admiration of Nick Fuentes, self-identification as a \u2018Groyper,\u2019 belief in Accelerationism, and support for violence all circumstantially show the mixed motives behind her actions on January 6: she not only specifically sought to block Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote, but also to undermine and obstruct the government more generally,' prosecutors wrote.Before her trial, Williams' attorneys questioned the relevance of her political activities and ideology.'There is no evidence linking her beliefs and actions prior to January 6 with her actions that day,' they wrote. 'There is a legitimate risk that jurors will judge Ms. Williams merely for the unpopular and extreme ideologies she has embraced in the past, rather than for the actual crimes with which she is charged.'"

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.There was an expected partisan divide on whether Trump should be charged with a crime, with 86% of Democrats questioned saying he should, but Republicans saying he shouldn\u2019t by a 68%-10% margin. Independents were more divided, with 38% unsure, 36% saying the former president should be charged, and a quarter insisting he shouldn\u2019t be charged.In a separate question, 58% of all respondents said Trump bears a great deal or quite a bit of responsibility for the attack on the Capitol.The former president has repeatedly pilloried the committee and its testimony on social media this month. Trump has attacked the panel as the 'Highly Unselect Committee' and has charged that witnesses have been telling 'lies and fabricated stories' with 'an all Fake Narrative being produced.'According to the poll, 42% of Americans say they\u2019ve watched or listened to the hearings, with 57% saying they\u2019re not watching or listening. Two-thirds of independents and just over seven in 10 Republicans say they haven\u2019t watched or listened to the hearings."

  "text": "'The Story' host Martha MacCallum provides the latest details on the investigationIn many of my speeches, I shared the heartbreaking story of Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old Black teenager who was accused of stealing a backpack and was incarcerated on Rikers Island for three years without trial. Two of those years were in solitary confinement. Kalief was abused by guards and gangs and attempted suicide in prison.Finally, after Kalief was released, the trauma this teenager had experienced was too much for him to bear, and he ultimately took his own life.During the months of arson, murder and other violence in 2020, Kamala Harris tweeted her support for the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out a woman charged with murder for stabbing her friend to death as well as a twice-convicted rapist charged with kidnapping and sexual assault. The protests of 2020 resulted in at least 25 deaths, thousands of injured police, and nearly $2 billion in damage to our cities.Yet we have heard nothing from Vice President Harris on the Jan. 6 detainees held for nearly a year without trial, some of whom have not been charged with any acts of violence against persons. Indeed, the sentences for the charges many face would likely fall short of the months they have already been jailed without conviction of a crime. Many have been held for long periods in solitary confinement.I condemned all violent acts on Jan. 6 and continue to do so. But that does not mean we should destroy the lives of non-violent protesters by deliberately conflating them with the acts of others, denying them bail, and incarcerating them for nearly a year with no trial. That is not justice. Our laws demand that even those accused of the most horrific crimes of mass murder are guaranteed due process. To abandon those principles for political purposes is to abandon the very bedrock of American jurisprudence.A true bipartisan criminal justice reform movement must defend the civil liberties of all Americans, regardless of race, religion, socioeconomic level, and political persuasion."

  "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., strongly condemned the Republican National Committee (RNC) censure resolution against GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger that referred to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol as \"legitimate political discourse.\"",

  "text": "Fox News congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie discusses bipartisan legislation that would mandate lawmakers place stocks in blind trusts while in Congress on \u2018Special Report.\u2019'Take back your party from this cult,' Pelosi said. 'Take back your party. America needs a strong Republican Party.'That language drew backlash from Democrats, who said the RNC is engaging in revisionist history by characterizing a violent attack on democracy as 'legitimate.' And some Republicans in the Senate have also expressed frustration that the RNC would put up a resolution that has the effect of dividing the party.Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday distanced himself from the RNC resolution saying it's 'not the job of the RNC' to single out Republicans while reaffirming that the Jan. 6 attack was 'a violent insurrection.''It was disturbing to see. \u2026 He literally ran away from the press when he was asked about his position,' Pelosi said. 'Republicans can run, but they cannot hide from what happened on Jan. 6, to call that legitimate political discourse \u2014140 law enforcement officers were wounded. Some people died. It was an assault on our Capitol, our Congress and more importantly an assault on our democracy.'McCarthy has since said the RNC should have been clearer that they weren't referring to Capitol violence as legitimate.Pelosi also said any member of Congress who participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection should also be 'held accountable.'Section 3 of the 14th Amendment \u2014 enacted in the wake of the Civil War \u2014 says no person shall serve in Congress 'who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.''I would hope that members of Congress who would participate in insurrection and sedition would be held accountable by their voters, including any former President of the United States,' Pelosi said."
