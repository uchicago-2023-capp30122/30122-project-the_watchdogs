  "text": "Tucker Carlson: The facts of January 6 have been distorted Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the Capitol riots and the January 6 committees primetime hearing on Tucker Carlson Tonight. You know it tells you a lot about the priorities of a ruling class that the rest of us are getting yet another lecture about January 6th tonight from our moral inferiors, no less. An outbreak of mob violence, a forgettably minor outbreak by recent standards, that took place more than a year and a half ago, but theyve never stopped talking about it. In the meantime, in the 18 months since January 6, gas prices have doubled. Drug ODs have reached their highest point ever. The U.S. economy is now careening toward a devastating recession at best and scariest and least noted of all, this country has never in its history been closer to a nuclear war.Yet the other networks cant be bothered to cover any of that tonight. Instead, theyve interrupted their regularly scheduled programing to bring you yet another extended primetime harangue from Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney about Donald Trump and QAnon. The whole thing is insulting. In fact, its deranged and were not playing along. This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live. They are lying, and we are not going to help them do it. What we will do instead is to try to tell you the truth. Weve attempted to do that since the day this happened. JAN. 6 COMMITTEE AIMS TO SHOW TRUMP WAS AT THE CENTER OF PLOT TO OVERTURN ELECTION WITH PRIMETIME HEARING VideoWe hated seeing vandalism at the U.S. Capitol a year and a half ago, and we said so at the time, but we did not think it was an insurrection because it was not an insurrection. It was not even close to an insurrection. Not a single person in the crowd that day was found to be carrying a firearm \u2013 some insurrection. In fact, the only person who wound up shot to death was a protester. She was a 36-year-old military veteran called Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was just over 5 feet tall. She was unarmed. She posed no conceivable threat to anyone, but Capitol Hill Police shot her in the neck and never explained why that was justified. Those are the facts of January 6, but since the very first hours, they have been distorted beyond recognition, relentlessly culminating with last night. Last night, CBS Nightly News told its viewers that insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6 \"caused the deaths of five police officers.\" That is a pure lie. There is nothing true about it, and they know that perfectly well. Heres reporter Bob Costa, who should be deeply ashamed to say something this dishonest. JANUARY 6 HEARING: REP. BANKS, BANNED FROM PANEL BY PELOSI, DESCRIBES HIS OWN INVESTIGATION ROBERT COSTA, CBS: Thursdays primetime hearing will take Americans back to January 6, when an estimated 2,000 rioters breached the Capitol building, causing the deaths of five police officers. Its hard to believe he said that. Rioters cause the deaths of five police officers. You just heard CBS News tell its viewers that. This must be the big lie theory. The more bewilderingly false a claim is, the more likely you will be to believe it. Apparently, thats what theyre betting on. In fact, precisely zero police officers were killed by rioters on January 6, not five, none. Not a single one. So, howd they get to five? Well, CBS is counting the suicides of local police officers that took place after January 6, in some cases, long after January 6. Suicide, unfortunately, is pretty common among cops. Policing is a tough job, as weve noted. But in these specific cases, the ones CBS is referring to, the chief of Washington DCs police department told The New York Times that actually he had no idea if his officers were driven to kill themselves by January 6. CBS just made that up. The fifth death that CBS News is referring to is of Capitol Hill police officer Brian Sicknick. You will remember his name. Sicknicks body lay in state at the Capitol after the media told us hed been beaten to death by Trump voters with a fire extinguisher. Heres what they told you. FREDERICKA WHITFIELD, CNN: Officer Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. CNN REPORTER: Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. ENERGY SEC. GRANHOLM SAYS GAS PRICES WILL BE ROUGH THIS SUMMER, DESPITE PREVIOUSLY LAUGHING THEM OFF VideoANA CABRERA, CNN: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the hour-long attack. NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC: They beat a Capitol Police officer to death with a fire extinguisher. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight. CRAIG MELVIN, MSNBC: He died at the age of 42 after he was bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher. Once again, thats not true. Everything you just heard was completely fabricated. The D.C. medical examiner performed an autopsy and the autopsy report showed that Officer Brian Sicknick had not suffered any kind of blunt force trauma. He was not beaten to death. He died of a stroke in his office later. No one has been charged in Officer Sicknicks death because Officer Sicknick wasnt murdered. They are lying to you. That is provable. Not a single person you just saw has apologized for lying. Not a single one. And its not just the news media. Heres Congressman Pete Aguilar of California claiming that officers lost their lives on January 6. BIDEN TELLS KIMMEL GAS PRICES OIL COMPANIES FAULT: \u2018NOBODY\u2019S LISTENING TO HIM, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR SAYS PETE AGUILAR: These hearings will be a chance for the country to come together to rally around the truth and unite around the rule of law. We owe it to the officers who lost their lives and the officers who were injured to tell that story and to ensure that this never happens again. Lets rally around the truth, he says, as he lies to you. May those words burn your tongue, liar. But what did happen exactly on January 6? Whats the truth of that day? Well, thats still unknown. From the extensive video we have of January 6, its clear that some in the crowd, more than a few, were encouraging protesters to breach the Capitol, to commit felonies. Were not guessing at that, weve showed you the tape. We have pictures of their faces. In the case of a man called Ray Epps, we know his name, but theyve never been charged. Ray Epps was standing in exactly the same place that a lot of people who went to jail were standing, but he wasnt charged. His name was taken off the FBIs Most Wanted list. Why is that? It doesnt make any sense at all. BIDENS KIMMEL INTERVIEW DISCOURAGING ON GUN CONTROL FOR CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR The January 6 committee will not explain that after a year, millions of dollars and a thousand interviews. They wont tell us, nor will they tell us how many FBI agents and assets were in the crowd that day and what were they doing there. Why cant we know that? And why are they still hiding thousands of hours of surveillance footage from within the Capitol? If the point of the committee was to get the truth out there, why cant we see the tape? Why did authorities open the doors of the Capitol to rioters and let them walk in, usher them in the doors? Thats utterly bizarre. You saw that live. No ones ever explained it. Whats the explanation for that? And by the way, whatever happened to the mysterious pipe bomber whose bombs we later learned many months later, Kamala Harris bodyguards discovered. Kamala Harris told us she was at the Capitol that day, but she wasnt. She was at the DNC with a pipe bomb outside. Her bodyguards found that bomb, but she lied about that. She hid that. Why? Thats got to be one of the weirdest stories ever. What does it mean, Liz Cheney? Silence. And of course, above all, they lied about the reason that January 6 happened in the first place and you know what it is. The entire country watched Joe Biden get what they claim was 10 million more votes than Barack Obama himself got. Joe Biden got 10 million more votes than Barack Obama got, and a lot of those votes arrived after the election. In a lot of places, voting was stopped in the middle of the night. Why? In the biggest states in the country, voter ID was optional. Why is that okay? A lot of the protesters on January 6 were very upset about that and they should have been. All of us should be, but the January 6 Committee ignored all of that completely. Instead, on the basis of zero evidence, no evidence whatsoever, they blamed the entire riot on White supremacy. Heres Joe Biden. WHY BLACK AMERICANS ARE LEAVING BIDEN IN DROVES  The White House has been plagued with drama in recent weeks as negative reports about President Biden\u2019s press office coincide with a series of messaging gaffes. AP Photo/Susan WalshPRESIDET BIDEN: Were confronting the stains of what remains, a deep stain on the soul of the nation, hate and White supremacy. The violent, deadly insurrection on the Capitol nine months ago was about White supremacy, in my view. What? Theres no evidence for that \u2013 none. The people at the Capitol, including the ones who broke the law by entering the Capitol, which is a crime, those people to a person said they were upset because they believed their democracy had been stolen from them and whether all of their claims are true or not, thats a valid reason to be upset. But rather than reassure the rest of us that actually our democracy is sound, elections are fair and transparent, theres no cheating and we can prove it, rather than do that, they call half the country names and not just names, the worst thing you can be called, a White supremacist. And then, most bewilderingly of all, virtually no Republican in Washington pushed back against any of that. In fact, Lindsey Graham, violence worshiper to the end, said that his only regret was that the Capitol Police didnt shoot more Trump voters in the neck and kill them. \"Youve got guns, use them,\" Graham said. So here you have a sitting U.S. senator, a Republican, urging police officers to shoot unarmed Americans, many of whom were ushered into the Capitol building by law enforcement. STUART VARNEY ON JAN 6 HEARINGS: DEMOCRATS HOPING ITS LIKE WATERGATE How can people talk like that? For more than a year, they justified rhetoric like Lindsey Graham \"shoot more\" by claiming that January 6 was an insurrection. Thats not a word they were used to describe, say, the monthslong siege of a courthouse in Portland, or the ongoing coordinated effort to intimidate Supreme Court justices at their homes with guns, a story they ignored today. But January 6 was different, they reminded us. It was unique because it was their offices and because it bothered Nancy Pelosi. ADAM SCHIFF: The president incited an insurrection against Congress to prevent the peaceful transition of power. CEDRIC RICHMOND: And then he sat back and watched the insurrection. REP. HALEY STEVENS: Insurrection, a violent mob. CORI BUSH: A White supremacist president who incited a White supremacist insurrection. REP. ILHAN OMAR: A insurrection against our government. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was an act of insurrection. PELOSI: The insurrection that violated the sanctity of the peoples Capitol. JIM MCGOVERN: This was not a protest, this was an insurrection. BIDEN: Its not protest. Its insurrection.  ABC\u2019s \"Good Morning America\" and \"World News Tonight,\" CBS\u2019 \"CBS Mornings\" and \"Evening News,\" and NBC\u2019s \"Today\" and \"Nightly News\" all ignored then-Vice President Biden\u2019s meeting with Eric Schwerin. AP Photo/Andrew HarnikWe are not defending and would never defend vandalism, violence, rioting. We disapproved of it when it happened. We disapprove of it now, all riots, not just this one. But this was not an insurrection. But, you know what will get you to insurrection? If you ignore the legitimate concerns of a population, if you brush them aside as if they dont matter when gas goes to $5 and you say \"buy an electric car.\" When cities become so filthy and so dangerous that you cant live there, when the economy becomes so distorted that your own children have no hope of getting married and giving you grandchildren, when you dont care at all about any of that and all you do is talk about yourself, nonstop \u2013 you might get an insurrection if you behave like that, speaking of insurrection.

  "text": "First Jan 6 primetime hearing set to begin Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins Special Report with the latest on what the American public can expect to find out about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on Thursdays primetime hearing. Lawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee, during their Thursday night primetime hearing, said former President Trump \"spurred a mob of domestic enemies\" to attack the Capitol in an effort to \"subvert American democracy\" and overturn the 2020 presidential election. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., in his opening statement, said Trump \"was at the center of this conspiracy.\" \"Ultimately, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, spurred a mob of domestic enemies..to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy,\" Thompson said. Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., during her opening statement, said Americans Thursday evening would see \"never-before-seen footage of the brutal attack on our Capitol.\"  US President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC. - Thousands of Trump supporters, fueled by his spurious claims of voter fraud, are flooding the nations capital protesting the expected certification of Joe Bidens White House victory by the US Congress.

Those who invaded our capital and battled law enforcement for hours were motivated by what President Trump had told them--that the election was stolen and that he was the rightful president,\" Cheney said. JAN. 6 COMMITTEE AIMS TO SHOW TRUMP WAS AT THE CENTER OF PLOT TO OVERTURN ELECTION WITH PRIMETIME HEARINGCheney added: \"President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.\" The Select Committee is played a never-before-seen video of graphic events that transpired during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. Thompson, before playing the tape, warned that it \"is hard to watch.\"  Violent insurrectionists, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.

AP Photo/John Minchillo, FileLawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee also presented videos of interviews and depositions with former top Trump officials before the select committee. During his opening statement, Thompson referred to former Attorney General Bill Barrs deposition before the committee. Barr said he had three discussions with Trump between Election Day 2020 and his early resignation from the Trump administration in December 2020.\"I made it clear I did not agree with the idea that the election was stolen, which, I told the president, was bulls--t,\" Barr said during his deposition. \"And you know, I didnt want to be a part of it, and thats one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when I did.\" U.S. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, left, and British filmmaker Nick Quested, are sworn in as the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol holds its first public hearing to reveal the findings of a year-long investigation, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, June 9, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Pool via AP Barr added that: \"You cant live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election--that there was fraud in the election.\"Cheney, one of only two Republican members on the committee, also played a clip from Barrs deposition during her opening statement, again undercutting Trumps claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen. \"I repeatedly told the president, in no uncertain terms, that I did not see evidence of fraud and that would have affected the outcome of the election,\" Barr said. \"And frankly, a year and a half later, I havent seen anything to change my mind on that.\" Cheney presented video testimony from Ivanka Trump on Barrs statement that the Justice Department found \"no fraud sufficient to overturn the election.\" During the video, Ivanka Trump was asked how Barrs statement affected her perspective of the election.

Both were members of the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Cheney said that there is \"no doubt that President Trump was well aware of the violence as it developed.\"\"White House staff urged President Trump to intervene and call off the mob,\" Cheney said, presenting a document written by a member of the White House staff \"advising what the president needed to say\" while the attack was underway at the Capitol.\"Anyone who entered the Capitol without proper authority should leave immediately,\" the note Cheney presented read. \"This is exactly what his supporters on Capitol Hill and nationwide were urging the president to do. He would not.\"Cheney also pointed to congressional leaders who \"begged\" Trump for help, including Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who was \"scared and called multiple members of President Trumps family after he could not persuade the president himself.\" Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., gives her opening remarks as Committee Chairman Rep.

He did not talk to the Department of Homeland Security.\"\"President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day, and he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and display and deploy law enforcement assets,\" Cheney said.Cheney, though, said then-Vice President Mike Pence did contact the Pentagon for assets to protect the Capitol. Cheney played audio of testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who said Pence \"was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders--there was no question about that.\" Milley said Pence urged then-Defense Secretary Christopher Miller to \"get military down here, get the guard down here, put down this situation.\"In contrast, Milley shared details of his conversation with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Red flag for me personally.\"The hearing will also feature testimony from two live witnesses \u2014 Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards and filmmaker Nick Quested.But a select committee aide said Wednesday the hearing in general will emphasize \"ongoing threats to our democracy\" related to Trump and Jan. 6.\"The vast majority of the material you will see \u2026 is previously unseen,\" a select committee aide said Wednesday. \"Whether it is recording video or audio of witnesses weve interviewed, whether it is records that weve obtained over the course of our investigation.REP.

  "text": "Jan. 6 hearing largely a rehash But media play up Pat Cippollone testimonyBiden\u2019s Justice Department argued in a filing on Wednesday that publicity drawn from the Jan. 6 special committee, including its assertion the riot at the U.S. Capitol was an \"insurrection,\" would not prevent five alleged members of the Oath Keepers from having a fair trial should it begin in September. Stewart Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, and Thomas Caldwell are facing seditious conspiracy charges to overthrow the U.S. government and are expected to stand trial on Sept. 26. In a new filing Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves argued against recent requests from the defendants for the trial start date to be pushed back and from the trial to be moved from Washington, D.C., arguing that the Jan. 6 committee hearing does not get in the way of their right to a fair trial. \"First, the defendants complain that they were prejudiced because Rep. Jamie Raskin asserted that what occurred on January 6 was an \u2018insurrection.\u2019 But several judges have already found that what the rioters did at the Capitol on January 6 was an \u2018insurrection\u2019,\" according to the DOJ filing. \"A statement from a congressperson during a congressional hearing using the same word has no impact on whether this trial should be continued or moved.\"AG GARLAND REFUSES TO RULE OUT PROSECUTING TRUMP FOR JAN. 6 Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes appears on a video screen above members of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol during the seventh hearing on July 12, 2022, in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesThe Justice Department recently agreed to push back the trial for five alleged members of the Proud Boys due to publicity and uncertainty stemming from the Jan. 6 committee and whether it will release witness transcripts with potentially relevant information, Politico reported. But for the members of the Oath Keepers, the DOJ contends the renewed motions from the defendants to continue and change the revenue should be denied because not much of the testimony from the committee hearings relate to their group.  Stewart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, told The Washington Post on February 28, 2021, in Fort Worth, Texas, that the government is trying to inflate the rogue actions of a few members into an alleged conspiracy committed by the organization on Jan. 6, 2021. Aaron C. Davis/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe DOJ notes that one hearing witness, in particular, Jason Van Tatenhove, testified that Oath Keepers as a group did have \"dangerous extremists\" and potentially people with White supremacist or racist views among them, but he never singled out any of the defendants as being one of those extremists or holding those views. U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta will ultimately make the call on whether the trial will be pushed back or moved. In its filing, the DOJ said that it was possible for a different federal judge, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden, to move the slated October start of the trial for Trump appointee and former State Department aide Freddie Klein so that his defense lawyers, who also represent defendant Meggs, could be available for the Oath Keepers trial scheduled to begin on Sept. 26. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGraves said that the argument from the Oath Keeper defendants that the District of Columbia is \"heavily biased\" and \"anti-Trump,\" and that the \"hearings have been largely consumed by left-leaning, politically-obsessed viewers\" who \"have been glued to their television sets\" lack evidence. The prosecutor said he did not agree with their assertion that \"thanks to a biased press, practically everyone in D.C., without knowing any of the facts, is convinced that the Rhodes defendants are guilty.\" Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

  "text": "Tucker: We are looking at growing authoritarianism Tucker Carlson Tonight host says there is an unprecedented effort to round up dissentersThis weekend, police in Columbus, Georgia arrested a 39-year-old man called Justin Tyren Roberts. Over the course of a single day, Roberts shot five separate people in two different states. We know this because Roberts has admitted it. He also said why he did it. In his confession, police say, Roberts, \"explained [that] throughout his life, specifically white males had taken from him.\" So he decided to kill them. In one case, Roberts walked up behind a white man, a total stranger, as he was getting out of a car and shot him in the back. By any definition, these were crimes of viciousness motivated by race hate. They\u2019re not unique in this country \u2014 not by a long shot. If we wanted to \u2014 and we don\u2019t \u2014 we could do a whole show on crimes like these. Nor are they especially surprising, when you think about it. If you really believed the propaganda from the Democratic Party and BLM are telling you \u2014 that white males are intentionally destroying the world \u2014 you might be motivated to hurt someone. Why wouldn\u2019t you? What\u2019s striking is how little attention Justin Tyren Roberts\u2019 shooting spree has received. Imagine if the colors here were reversed. Roberts would be leading every newscast tonight. Needless to say, he\u2019s not. In fact, this may be the last time you hear his name on television. On one level, that\u2019s fine with us. Picking at the wound, America\u2019s wound is unwise. We\u2019ve always thought that. We think it more now than ever. A multi-racial country can only survive if it self-consciously deemphasizes race \u2014 if it treats every person as an individual and not a member of some larger group that\u2019s guilty or innocent. That should be the goal, it\u2019s our history, and we should get back to it as soon as we can. MULTI-STATE SHOOTING SPREE WAS RACIALLY MOTIVATED, SUSPECT WAS TARGETING WHITE MEN: REPORTBut that\u2019s not what our leaders are doing. They\u2019re doing just the opposite. They\u2019re working hard to divide us into warring camps with lies. They\u2019re telling us a story that is completely \u2014 and very much intentionally \u2014 disconnected from reality. They\u2019re claiming that something called white supremacy, a term they never define, is the greatest threat we face. A greater threat than Al Qaeda or ISIS. Our thoroughly craven attorney general told us that very lie today. MERRICK GARLAND: In the FBIs view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of the white race.That was the Attorney General of the United States stating a fact backed up by the FBI. So it\u2019s fair to ask the obvious questions.Who are these violent white supremacists exactly? What are their names? What crimes have they committed? We still don\u2019t know. Merrick Garland didn\u2019t tell us. He spent most of his speech talking about the riot at the Capitol on January 6th, an event that had nothing whatsoever to do with race. But Merrick Garland lied about that. He, like the rest of the liars you see on television, wants you to believe and wants history to record, that January 6th was an attempted insurrection by white supremacist revolutionaries bent on taking over this country. We came this close, Garland said. And that\u2019s why \"We must adopt a broader societal response to tackle the problems deeper roots.\" GREG GUTFELD: THE MEDIA IS EGGING ON CITIZENS TO HUNT DOWN OTHER CITIZENSBecause of January 6th, says the chief law enforcement officer in the United States of America, and many other members of Joe Biden\u2019s cabinet, we must now use law enforcement and military force to arrest, imprison, and otherwise crush anyone who leads opposition to Joe Biden\u2019s government. That\u2019s their position. They say it out loud. So what is this, exactly? Well, it\u2019s a big change in the way the U.S. government treats its own citizens. We\u2019re looking at the transformation of a democratic republic into something else. We\u2019re looking at growing authoritarianism. That\u2019s not an overstatement. Vladimir Putin knows authoritarian systems well. He sees very clearly what\u2019s happening in this country. KEIR SIMMONS, NBC: Did you order Alexei Navalnys assassination? PUTIN: Of course not. We don\u2019t have this kind of habit of assassinating anyone. That\u2019s number one. Number two, I want to ask you: Did you order the assassination of the woman who walked into the Congress and who was shot and killed by a policeman? Do you know that 450 individuals were arrested after entering the Congress? And they didnt go there to steal a laptop. They came with political demands.Under normal circumstances, we wouldn\u2019t quote a foreign adversary criticizing our government, but honestly, those are entirely fair questions. Who did shoot Ashli Babbit? Why don\u2019t we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That\u2019s OK now? No, it\u2019s not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protesters still in prison on trespassing charges, while so many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What\u2019s the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call it scary. We\u2019d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator. LEVIN QUESTIONS STANDARD OF JUSTICE AS CAPITOL RIOTERS HELD UNDER STRICT CONFINEMENT, WHILE ANTIFA ROAMS FREEAnd speaking of January 6th, why are there still so many things, basic factual matters, we don\u2019t know about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration hiding more than 10,000 hours of surveillance tape from the U.S. Capitol? What could possibly be the reason for that? Even as they call for more openness. We need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those tapes today, but they\u2019re not. Why? We ought to be asking those questions, urgently. Because as the attorney general reminded us, a lot depends on the answers. At least one news organization is. Revolver.news is a new site and turned out to be one of the last honest outlets on the internet. A new piece on the site suggests an answer to some of these questions. We know the government is hiding the identity of many law enforcement officers who were present at the capitol on January 6, not just the one who killed Ashli Babbitt. According to the governments own court filings, those law enforcement officers participated in the riot. Sometimes in violent ways.We know that because, without fail, the government has thrown the book at most of the people who were in the Capitol on January 6. There was a nationwide dragnet to find them. Many of them are still in solitary confinement tonight. But, strangely, some people who participated in the riot havent been charged. Look at the documents. The government calls these people \"unindicted co-conspirators.\" What does that mean? It means that in potentially every case, theyre FBI operatives. ASHLI BABBITTS HUSBAND DEMANDS IDENTITY OF CAPITOL OFFICER WHO SHOT HER BE RELEASED: \u2018NOBODY IS TELLING US\u2019For example, one of those \"unindicted co-conspirators\" is someone the government identifies only as \"Person Two.\" According to those documents, \"Person Two\" stayed in the same hotel room as an \"insurrectionist\" named Thomas Caldwell, whos alleged to be a member of the group called the Oath Keepers. \"Person Two\" also \"stormed the barricades\" at the Capitol on January 6, alongside Thomas Caldwell. The governments indictments further indicate that Caldwell -- who by the way is a 65-year-old man -- was led to believe there would be a \"quick reaction force\" also participating in January 6. That quick reaction force, Caldwell was told, would be led by someone called \"Person Three\" -- who had a hotel room and an accomplice. But wait. Here\u2019s the interesting thing. \"Person Two\" and \"Person Three\" were organizers of the riot. The government knows who they are, but the government has not charged them. Why is that? You know why. They were almost certainly working for the FBI. So FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6, according to government documents. And those two are not alone. PELOSI PUSHES FORWARD WITH VOTING RIGHTS, JAN. 6 INVESTIGATIONS CITING \u2018REPUBLICAN ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY\u2019In all, Revolver News reported that there are, quote, \"upwards of 20 unindicted co-conspirators in the Oath Keeper indictments, all playing various roles in the conspiracy, who have not been charged for virtually the exact same activities \u2014 and in some cases much, much more severe activities \u2014 as those named alongside them in indictments.\" Huh? So it turns out this white supremacist insurrection was, again, by the government\u2019s own admission in these documents, organized, at least in part, by government agents. Are you shocked? You shouldnt be. In March, the FBI director admitted the bureau is infiltrating as many dissident groups as it possibly could.SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: There must be moments where you think if we would have known, if we could have infiltrated this group or found out what they were doing, and that -- you have those moments? WRAY: Any time there is an attack, especially one thats this horrific, that strikes right at the heart of our system the government, right at the time of transfer of power is being discussed, you can be darn tooting that we are focused very, very hard on how could we get better sources, better information, better analysis so that we can make sure that something that what happened on January 6th never happens again.Wait a second \u2013 there\u2019s a huge difference between using an informant to find out what a group you find threatening might do, and paying people to organize a violent action, which is what happened, apparently according to government documents, on January 6. TUCKER CARLSON: IF YOU READ GOVERNMENT DATA, YOULL BE THROWN IN JAIL AND CENSORED BY BIG TECHThat\u2019s a line, and the FBI has crossed it. And that\u2019s not the first time. They crossed that line in Michigan. Remember that plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer? And Whitmer is able to cover some of her own incompetence, although not all, by pointing to the fact that she\u2019s not a victim. In the FBIs telling, a whole team of insurrectionists was going to drive a van up to Gretchen Whitmers vacation house and throw her in the back and drive away. The mastermind, the bureau said, was a man called Adam Fox. Who was Adam Fox? He turned out to be a homeless guy who was living in the basement of a vacuum repair shop. The whole story was a farce. Insulting really. But if you read the governments charging documents carefully, and you should, youll see that it gets even more ridiculous. It turns out that one of the five people in the planned \"Gretchen Whitmer kidnap van\" was an FBI agent. In the van. Another was an FBI informant. The feds admit that an informant or undercover agent was \"usually present\" in the group\u2019s meetings. In other words, nearly half the gang of kidnappers were working for the FBI. Remember the guy who suggested using a bomb to blow up a bridge as part of the plot? That got a lot of coverage. That guy was an undercover FBI agent. If you wondered why theyre always comparing January 6 to 9/11, theres your answer. Theyre using the same tactics. And a lot of us missed this the first time around. We didn\u2019t see the obvious. If you empower the government to violate civil liberties in pursuit of a foreign terror organization, and there are foreign terror organizations, it\u2019s just a matter of time before ambitious politicians use those same mechanisms to suppress political dissent. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now. We should have seen it earlier.Trevor Aaronsons book \"The Terror Factory\" analyzed every terrorism prosecution from 2001 to 2013. Aaronson found that at least 50 defendants were on trial because of behavior that the FBI had not only encouraged, but enabled. FBI agents were essentially the plotters in these crimes. They made the crimes, crimes. TUCKER CARLSON: DEMOCRATS ARE WAGING A NEW WAR, AGAINST YOUIn 2012, a writer for The Nation called Petra Bartosiewicz found that FBI informants had quote, \"Crossed the line from merely observing potential criminal behavior, which is allowed and good, to encouraging and assisting people to participate in plots that are largely scripted by the FBI itself.\" And we checked. We looked carefully, and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. One of those plots was an Islamic terrorist attack in 2015 in Garland Texas. It turns out the FBI played an active role in that shooting. ANDERSON COOPER: The FBI was much closer to the Garland attack than anyone realized. Anderson Cooper: After the trial, you discovered that the government knew a lot more about the Garland attack than they had let on? DAN MAYNARD: That\u2019s right. Yeah. After the trial we found out that they had had an undercover agent who had been texting with Elton Simpson, less than three weeks before the attack, to him \"Tear up Texas.\" Which to me was an encouragement to Simpson. ANDERSON COOPER: The man he\u2019s talking about was a special agent of the FBI, working undercover posing as an Islamic radical.So they\u2019re doing that to Islamic radicals, what are they doing to American citizens? That should worry you. In a moment of uncharacteristic honesty, a former FBI Assistant Director called Frank Figliuzzi explained on MSNBC. The goal is to round up political dissenters and throw them in solitary -- including members of Congress.FIGLIUZZI: What have we learned from our experience with international terrorism? In order to address that problem, arresting low-level operatives is merely a speed bump, not a roadblock. In order to really tackle terrorism, this time domestically, youve got to attack and dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group\u2026That may mean people sitting in Congress right now. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRound up duly-elected democratic members of Congress because they oppose the machine? Even Vladimir Putin\u2019s not doing that. And a former Assistant Director of the FBI called for it on television, and no one noticed. Why not round up the FBI operatives who were rioting on January 6? Why not identify the guy who killed Ashli Babbit? This is crazy, and we should resist it.

  "text": "Biden, Harris deliver remarks to mark one year since Jan. 6 assault on US Capitol It\u2019s been one year since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an apparent effort to thwart the certification of President Bidens presidential win. One of the rioters was fatally shot by Capitol Police during the attack and more than 700 were charged with crimes.Capitol Police say they\u2019re prepared for what is expected to be an emotional day, with multiple vigils, commemorations and demonstrations planned in the nation\u2019s capital. JAN. 6 ANNIVERSARY SPEECH: BIDEN TO CALL OUT TRUMPS RESPONSIBILITYJan. 6, 2021On Jan. 6, 2021, after weeks of then-President Trump claiming the 2020 election had been stolen from him, thousands of his supporters broke off from his rally at Freedom Plaza near the White House and headed toward the Capitol Complex.Lawmakers were forced to evacuate the complex and temporarily suspend the certification of the Electoral College results as rioters plowed through police perimeters, breached the building and occupied it for several hours. In this Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, file photo, supporters of President Trump scale the west wall of the the U.S. Capitol in Washington. APAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer while attempting to force her way into the House chamber. Another person died during the riot after suffering a drug overdose, and two others died naturally from medical emergencies.Brian Sicknick, a 42-year-Capitol Police officer, was pepper-sprayed during the chaos and died the next day after suffering from two thromboembolic strokes. Four other officers who responded to the riot committed suicide in the months following. The counting of the electoral votes resumed hours after the riot, and then-Vice President Mike Pence declared Biden the winner.Trump, who still claims the election was stolen from him, was impeached by the House one week after the riot for \"incitement of insurrection,\" with 10 Republicans voting in favor, the most pro-impeachment votes ever from a presidents party. Trump left office on Jan. 20 and was acquitted by the Senate more than three weeks later.The Jan. 6 riot is still being investigated by a House select committee, which recently invited House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Scott Perry, R-Pa., to give voluntary interviews. All three have so far declined.McCarthy, who spoke to Trump on Jan. 6, told local CBS affiliate KBAK that he didnt \"have anything to add\" regarding the House committees investigation and maintained that he has been very public about that day and has nothing to hide.HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE REQUESTS \u2018VOLUNTARY COOPERATION\u2019 FROM GOP REP. JIM JORDANArrestsThe U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia charged more than 700 people across the country for their alleged participation in the riot, including at least 81 current or former service members, CBS News reported Monday.About 275 Capitol riot defendants have been charged with a felony offense of attempting to \"corruptly obstruct, influence, or impede\" the Electoral College certification, the report said.More than 150 of the defendants have pleaded guilty, and 71 have been sentenced as of Jan. 1, according to a Politico analysis released Monday.Most of those sentenced so far were convicted of misdemeanors, such as illegally entering the Capitol building, and fewer than half of those sentenced have received prison time. The median prison sentence for the Capitol rioters to date is 45 days, Politico reported.The stiffest sentence to date was handed to Robert Palmer, who was sentenced last month to more than five years in prison after he admitted he was the man photographed throwing a wooden plank at police outside the Capitol and spraying a fire extinguisher at officers, then throwing the empty device at the line of police.Palmer\u2019s prison sentence is more than a year and a half longer than any other defendant, Politico reported.More than 530 defendants have yet to stand trial, but a handful of trials are tentatively scheduled to begin in April, CBS News reported. Robert Palmer, 54, of Largo, Florida, seen wearing an American flag jacket, was sentenced to 63 months behind bars Dec. 17, 2021, for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Department of JusticeCapitol securityNearly a year after the Capitol attack, more than 130 Capitol Police officers have left the department. The Capitol Police, at this point, is nearly 400 officers short of its authorized level. U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, who took over the force in July, told the Senate Rules Committee in written testimony on Wednesday that of the 103 recommendations issued by the Capitol Police Inspector General to strengthen security at the Capitol, \"we have implemented and/or addressed over 90 of them.\" U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger testifies during a Senate Rules and Administration Committee oversight hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 5, 2022, in Washington. Tom Williams/Pool via APBut Manger told \"Fox News Sunday\" days earlier that the staffing shortage at the agency remains a \"critical\" issue.\"The one thing that we have not been able to fix, so to speak, are the staffing issues, and weve lost over 130 officers that have left through either retirements or resignations after January 6,\" he said.Asked during a Tuesday news conference if he believed the Capitol was more secure today than it was on the day of the riot last year, Manger expressed confidence in the improvements already made and expressed little concern about planned demonstrations today in the nations capital.\"Were aware of several events that are planned for Thursday, most of them arent of much concern to us,\" he said. \"Theres no intelligence that indicates that there would be any problems.\"The police chief did, however, point to one event that authorities are keeping their eye on, a planned demonstration by Look Ahead America, a conservative group demanding justice for those still jailed after last years riot.\"Theres one event that is occurring, I think down at the D.C. jail that were paying attention to, but again, really nothing that is of great concern to us at this point,\" Manger said.House Republicans have warned the Capitol is no more secure today than it was at the time of the riot, slamming House Democrats for failing to implement proposed security reforms and instead focusing on their \"partisan\" investigation into the origin of the incident. The top Republican on the Committee on House Administration, Rep. Rodney Davis, penned a memo to GOP colleagues Monday titled: \"One Year Later, Little Has Changed.\"Davis wrote that there are \"important facts that cannot be ignored about what occurred before, during, and after that day,\" saying that Democrats on the Jan. 6 Committee are \"no closer to finding out what led to the catastrophic security failure,\" and instead are hellbent to \"attack President Trump and punish anyone associated with him.\"  Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6. AP Photo/Julio Cortez, FileDavis also penned a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Monday demanding House offices under her control stop obstructing a GOP investigation into the Capitol buildings security vulnerabilities. \"The events of January 6, 2021 exposed serious security vulnerabilities at the Capitol Complex,\" Davis wrote. \"Unfortunately, over the past twelve months, House Democrats have been more interested in exploiting the events of January 6th for political purposes than in conducting basic oversight of the security vulnerabilities exposed that day.\"EventsMultiple events will be held today in the nations capital to commemorate one year since the attack, starting with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivering remarks from the U.S. Capitol at 9 a.m. EST.During his speech, Biden is expected to call out Trump as holding the \"singular responsibility\" for the \"chaos and carnage\" on Jan. 6, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.Pelosi will deliver remarks and hold a moment of silence on the House floor at noon today, followed by a \"moderated conversation\" in the Cannon Caucus Room aimed to \"establish and preserve the narrative of January 6th,\" which will feature Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Librarian of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden and historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham at 1 p.m., according to a press memo sent by Pelosis office on Tuesday.At 2:30 p.m., lawmakers will begin sharing testimonials of the attack in a session led by Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., which will then be capped off with a bicameral prayer vigil on the Capitol Center Steps at 5:30 p.m.According to a press advisory sent by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s office, the Georgia Republican and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., will hold a \"Republican response to expose the truth about the January 6, 2021 protests\" in the Cannon House Office Building at 2:15 p.m.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMeanwhile, a coalition of more than 130 liberal organizations will hold a candlelight vigil at the National Mall starting at 4:45 p.m., and the right-wing Look Ahead America will hold a vigil outside the D.C. jail.

  "text": "Tucker: What really happened on Jan 6 Tucker Carlson Tonight host shows how the media uses history as a tool to distort the truthHow did this happen today of all days?Why has this gone on for so long?Those are the two questions I still have a year after the riot at the U.S. Capitol.I was on the air for more than 15 hours on January 6 and 7, 2021, holed up in the basement of the Capitol, during the insurrection. I actually didn\u2019t start my day on January 6 until about 1 pm \u2013 the time when the House and Senate convened a Joint Session of Congress to certify the Electoral College. I began later than usual because we expected Republican lawmakers to contest up to six states. The House and Senate are allowed to debate each state\u2019s slate of electors for two hours and then vote. So I thought the process may bleed well into January 7th if not January 8th.FBI STILL HUNTING JAN. 6 SUSPECTS, PIPE BOMBER A YEAR LATERAnd therein lies the essence of my first question.How did the riot happen on January 6th of all days?The House and Senate only convene a Joint Session of Congress for two events: the President\u2019s State of the Union address and to certify the Electoral College.The Vice President and the Speaker of the House preside over this session. The Joint Session in January 2013, to certify the re-election of President Obama was a sleepy affair. No members challenged any state\u2019s electoral votes. Fewer than 80 members from either body came to the House chamber to watch \"tellers\" a group of House and Senate members inspect the electoral votes and to hear then-Vice President Biden announce the results. In fact, many freshman members \u2013 on the job for just a few days \u2013 only swung by so they could meet the vice president or pose for a photograph. Supporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by U.S. Capitol Police officers outside the Senate Chamber inside the Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 in Washington. AP Photo/Manuel Balce CenetaJanuary 6, 2021, emerged as one of the most toxic, intense days ever seen at the historic U.S. Capitol.Security forces expected protests. The Capitol is used to demonstrations. But no one was ready for what unfolded last year. Multiple security officials told Fox in the days leading up to the riot that their biggest concern was a \"lone wolf.\" And for years, Congressional security experts figured that the biggest danger to the Capitol were foreign terrorists, an airplane, or a bomb. Something akin to 9/11.They never anticipated that a mob of Americans would descend on the Capitol and try to rip the place apart. Especially on a day as central to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power.REP. TROY NEHLS REFLECTS ON PROTECTING HOUSE CHAMBER ON JAN. 6 WITH MAKESHIFT WEAPON: \u2018I REFUSED TO LEAVE\u2019I\u2019ve observed the fury and rage percolate for years now. Americans of both sides \u2013 or unaffiliated \u2013 rage at Washington. Some of it justified. Some of it not. Some of it uninformed. Some just hyperventilating. But to see a mob ransack the U.S. Capitol in the middle of one of the most crucial moments in American democracy is the antithesis of the entire exercise. I never thought I would witness fellow citizens storm America\u2019s citadel of democracy, break glass windows, assault police officers, defecate on the Milton tile floors of the Capitol and attempt to barge into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby with intent to do God knows what.Chilling doesn\u2019t do the scenario justice. Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. AP Photo/Julio Cortez The Capitol Police were outmanned, out planned, and out-frenzied by the mob that day. It is hard to defend an institution as important as the United States Capitol on a day as crucial as certifying the Electoral College when you face a deficit in all three categories.It\u2019s one thing for a swarm of people to descend on Capitol Hill to protest. We\u2019ve seen that before. It\u2019s another thing to face a violent throng whipped into a fever like the one a year ago.The tabulation of the Electoral College will no longer be a sluggish enterprise. People now know the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue run directly through January 6. The riot forever changes the significance of that date. It also exposes the potential volatility of the certification process. This is why there\u2019s now talk on Capitol Hill about trying to update the Electoral Count Act \u2013 the law which dictates how Congress certifies the Electoral College results.JAN. 6 ANNIVERSARY SPEECH: BIDEN TO CALL OUT TRUMPS \u2018RESPONSIBILITY\u2019There were challenges to electoral votes before. Democrats attempted to question the certification of electoral votes for President George W. Bush in both 2001 and 2005. The 2001 effort didn\u2019t get very far. The 2005 maneuver actually prompted a brief debate in the House and Senate over electors from Ohio.The Founders placed a ticking bomb inside the Constitution when it comes to the Electoral College. People don\u2019t elect the President. Electors who comprise the Electoral College do. There\u2019s a chasm for potential mischief between voters casting their ballots and the certification of a state\u2019s electoral votes in Congress. This is further enhanced by the Founders mandating that the House would pick the president if the Electoral College results weren\u2019t clear. Such \"contingent elections\" presented the country with Presidents Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and John Quincy Adams in 1825. Authorities secure the area outside the U.S. Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin APBut back to January 6th last year.What took so long to quash the uprising?Practically every lawmaker, aide, reporter, and custodian always believed the Capitol was a fortress. Impenetrable. The building dodged disaster on 9/11. There are a lot of Capitol police officers. But there were nowhere near as many officers as were needed to repel a pulse of people surging toward the Capitol as there were on 1/6.There are scores of questions about why former President Trump didn\u2019t act sooner to implore his supporters to stand down. One GOP lawmaker told Fox that Mr. Trump\u2019s inaction for hours on that day \"was the most malicious thing\" about 1/6. Lawmakers and security officials from both sides believe a speedier response from the president would have prevented the situation from deteriorating.Discrepancies linger about when the National Guard was ordered to the Capitol. Current House Sergeant at Arms William Walker was in charge of the Washington, D.C., National Guard on 1/6. Walker said he expected to get the green light from the Pentagon to thwart the riot early in the afternoon. The Guard never got the orders to swing into action for three hours. An Army report disputed that it took too long to respond. Walker and the DC National Guard\u2019s attorney argues that the Army report is made of whole cloth.Former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller told a House panel last year that if troops went to the Capitol, there were \"fears that the President would invoke the Insurrection Act to politicize the military in an anti-democratic manner.\"In other words, Miller worried that former President Trump would convert those troops, trying to crush the mob, into a force which would declare him the winner. Miller told the House committee there was \"heightened commentary in the media about the possibility of a military coup or that advisors to the President were advocating the declaration of martial law.\"It doesn\u2019t get much scarier than that.Unless you try to understand why it took Capitol Police tactical units more than 45 minutes to finally end a siege in the House chamber with thugs pounding on the doors.This is why House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had it out with the president in a heated phone call. Other Congressional leaders called governors. The Pentagon. You name it. Anybody and anything to clear the Capitol.It took hours. And hours. And hours.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThese are the questions: Why did the riot happen on January 6 of all days? Why did the riot go on for so long? There only are partial answers to these questions a year later. But some of the answers only beg deeper questions.

But Irving insisted he did not receive the request for National Guard support until after 2 p.m. while in former Stenger\u2019s office.

To that, Sen.

  "text": "US Capitol Flags being flown at half-staff <br>The congressional endeavor of certifying the presidential winner in the Electoral College is typically a banal ritual.But on Wednesday after weeks of mounting emotions, lawsuits to overturn the results, and an insistence from President Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen, the ceremonial duty became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by a raid of the Capitol, shots ringing out, tear gas and lives lost.So what happened? According to one U.S. military veteran heavily involved in the planning of Wednesdays protests, attendees came from across the country.\"Whether it was Veterans for Trump or Bikers for Trump or Latinos for Trump, we were all there together. We came together by action and the call of our president,\" the source, who spoke on background, told Fox News. \"Our commander-in-chief had requested our assistance, and any veteran with honor listens to the commander-in-chief. That is the spirit in which we live.\" Supporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by Capitol Police officers outside the Senate Chamber inside the Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 in Washington. AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta In the days leading up to Wednesday, Trump supporters started \"pouring in,\" the source said.\"Everything was booked; you couldnt get a room. People were camping out in the cold,\" the organizer said, explaining that buses brought supporters from out-of-state. \"It was a call to action. We knew this was going to be a big day and an important point in time.\" NEW FBI WANTED POSTERS IN CAPITOL RIOT MANHUNTJan. 6, the date for certification of the Electoral College, began with small crowds of Trump supporters filtering into designated areas around the Ellipse for permit-approved rallies.Around 10 a.m., in bone-chilling cold, Trumps sons and his longtime lawyer spoke to the growing crowds, and after the presidents speech, in which he said he would never concede, thousands marched toward the Capitol after he suggested that they should.\"We\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol and we\u2019re going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,\" Trump said.Meanwhile, many more protesters accumulated by the White House lawn.But shortly after 1 p.m., demonstrators started clashing with law enforcement on the steps of the Capitol. Less than 30 minutes later, representatives inside the building were being evacuated amid reports of a bomb outside. And at about 2:10 p.m., rioters managed to blow past police lines and scale the walls around the building.BLM ACTIVIST INSIDE CAPITOL CLAIMS HE WAS DOCUMENTING RIOTS, ONCE SAID BURN IT ALL DOWNWithin another 40 minutes, the barricades ruptured and thousands headed into the chambers with anger, exhilaration, determination and confusion. After the initial scuffle and breach, word spread quickly through social media forums and scores followed each others footsteps inside. In this Jan. 6, photo, President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally in Washington. Although pro-democracy and human rights activists around the globe were stunned to see a raging mob storm the U.S. Capitol, they say they were heartened and inspired because the system ultimately prevailed. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File From the one insiders point-of-view, the \"doors were already open to them, and the barricades had been pulled down already.\" People simply \"wanted to be heard in the chambers,\" they \"wanted their voices heard,\" and were \"sick and tired of what had been going on.\"Trump eventually urged backers to protest \"peacefully and patriotically,\" but the chaos continued.But whether or not detailed plans to overrun the federal building had been set in motion earlier was subject to debate. One Washington security employee connected to the White House told Fox News that its likely 95% of the attendees were there to protest non-violently. Still, there was likely a sub-section of attendees with more violent intentions.\"Many of the attackers appeared dressed for a riot \u2013 suggesting some element of planning,\" said Jordan Strauss, managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a division of New York-based risk consultancy Duff & Phelps. \"But I suspect that it was a combination, with some individuals having announced themselves as having come to storm the Capitol or incite some sort of revolution. It would surprise me if some otherwise peaceful protesters were not swept up in the fever of the moment and decided to cross the threshold from peaceful protesters to criminals on the spot.\" Nonetheless, the drawing in of MAGA devotees and Trump loyalists for the coveted date had long been in the works, mostly through Facebook pages and online groups \u2013 many of which are above-board, registered non-profit 501c3s. According to a number of those who attended Wednesdays events, the big push began after Trump tweeted on Dec. 19: \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6. Be there, be wild!\"Flyers, pinpointing three locations to meet, quickly appeared under the headline \"Trump Wants to See You in D.C.\" Open-source discussions about flight costs and places to stay grew. Some prepared to bring bulletproof clothing and weapons for protection, expressing concern over countering Antifa activists.\"Theres often little sophistication to how these events are planned,\" said Ryan Schonfeld, founder & CEO, RAS Security Group. \"The ability to respond in a coordinated manner is possible with the right combination of people and technology making sense of the available data. An exacerbating factor is misinformation, often spread through the use of fake social media and online accounts and profiles.\"Momentum, augmented heavily by Trumps rhetoric, continued to gather as the reckoning day to \"stop the steal\" neared. Several already well-established contingencies supporting the president continued to encourage backers to show up, and new Facebook groups echoing the rallying cry surfaced. While less-regulated social media sites such as Gab and Parler have become common platforms for protest discussions, several of those involved told Fox News that most communication was not underground or via encryption, but open-source.\"We augment and push out our events through social media messaging, and we have direct coordinators and influencers with large followings who help in letting our supporters know event times and locations,\" the source continued. \"The point was to be there for the president. All of these patriot groups wanted to be there. We dont want to see the theft of America or a banana republic.\" Smoke fills the walkway outside the Senate Chamber as supporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by U.S. Capitol Police officers inside the Capitol, Jan. 6, in Washington. AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta Last Friday, the first day of 2021, after a surprise early departure from his Floridas Mar-a-Lago residence before ringing in the New Year with his most ardent donors, Trump tweeted that the \"BIG Protest Rally\" would begin at 11 a.m. on Jan. 6.The rally was set against a backdrop of failed lawsuits advocated by Lin Wood, Sidney Powell and others to overturn Joe Bidens November victory. And Trump supporters hopes that he would remain in the White House were revived by the Jan. 2 declaration by 12 Republican senators including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Texas Ted Cruz to lodge objections to the Electoral College certification.TRUMP SAYS HE WILL NOT BE GOING TO BIDENS INAUGURATIONBut how and why the Capitol was so easily breached remains a sore point many security experts are piecing together. Officials have contended that despite weeks of planning between federal and local law enforcement agencies, which also entailed social media monitoring, there was no intelligence to indicate the historic chaos.The \"lack of intel\" line sparked further conspiracies by those at the rally.Some involved in Wednesdays breach still maintain that it was never their intention -- and rather, that anti-Trump agitators initiated it.Another pro-Trump activist vowed that there were \"different anarchists involved,\" some of whom took advantage of \"trying to get patriotic, emotionally charged people to do something stupid\" -- like following the leader into the Capitol.Nonetheless, the whole episode shook the Washington security apparatus to the core.As Chris Edwards, director of Tax Policy Studies at the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, said it would be hard for the Capitol Police to complain about underfunding.\"The force has 2,300 officers and a $516 million budget to defend two square miles,\" Edwards said.Spending on the police force increased from $115 million in 2000 to an estimated $516 million for 2021, he said.\"That equals an annual average growth rate of 7.4 percent, much faster than the 2.1 percent average annual inflation over the period, Edwards said. \"The Capitol Police budget is more than the police budgets of Atlanta and Detroit.\"In the end, at least five people -- including a police officer defending the Capitol, and military veteran and Trump adherent Ashli Babbitt, who was shot as she entered through a window -- died. So far, police have made more than 68 arrests, 41 of them on Capitol turf and only one identified as Washington resident, authorities have said.

Jim Jordan discusses how the Jan. 6 committee refers House Republicans for ethics violations on \u2018Hannity.\u2019Ahead of the House January 6 committees final report, the five Republicans who were originally nominated to sit on the select committee on Wednesday released a counter-report on security failures at the Capitol, which they said \"the Democrat-led investigation has thus far ignored.\" Reps. Jim Banks, R-Ind., Rodney Davis, R-Ill., Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., and Troy Nehls, R-Texas, largely blamed bureaucratic mismanagement and \"political pressures\" from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., exerted on the House Sergeant at Arms that left U.S. Capitol Police USCP unprepared for the violence of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot.\"When Speaker Pelosi made the unprecedented decision to reject Jim Banks and Jim Jordan from sitting on the January 6 Select Committee \u2014 we knew she intended to play politics instead of addressing the massive security failures that lead to that day,\" the lawmakers said in a statement.\"We said then that we would investigate and get to the bottom of why the Capitol was left so unprepared that day, and what needs to be done to make sure our security apparatus is never left so unprepared again,\" they added. \"Unsurprisingly, the Select Committee appears to have spent almost no time on this issue.

One rioter, Dustin Byron Thompson, was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the attack. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, FileThe GOP report blames \"leadership and law enforcement failures\" for making the Capitol vulnerable. It said changes to USCP intelligence protocols in the lead-up to Jan. 6 \"caused confusion and rendered a key USCP component ineffective\" during the mob violence. Republicans accused former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving of being \"compromised by politics,\" coordinating closely with Pelosi and her staff but leaving GOP lawmakers out of discussions about security. The report said Democratic leaders were concerned over the \"optics\" of deploying the National Guard in response to the riot, given the Black Lives Matter riots that took place in the summer of 2020. The GOP lawmakers alleged these concerns prevented early deployment of the National Guard.\"To make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,\" the report said. \"One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap. Even if every USCP officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. The USCP was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.\"Republicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and USCP sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesThe GOP report is meant to supplement a bipartisan report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration last year. That report identified several security, planning and response failures leading up to the riot, including FBI and Homeland Security intelligence officials neglecting to warn of potential violence and USPC unpreparedness. \"The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board\u2019s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard DCNG was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,\" the Senate report found. Pelosi has repeatedly denied GOP allegations that she or her office prevented the National Guard from deploying, or otherwise ignored threats of violence leading up to the riot. The Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday. Seven Democrats and the two anti-Trump Republicans on the committee, Reps.

The referrals include obstructing an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to defraud the federal government, making a false statement, and inciting, assisting, or aiding and comforting an insurrection.In what is expected to be its final meeting on Monday, the House Select Committee to Investigate January 6 said it will formally ask the DOJ to pursue charges after a nearly 18-month probe into the former president\u2019s involvement in the activities that lead to the Capitol breach on January 6, 2021.The committee said on Monday that it believes it has significant evidence that former President Trump intended to disrupt the peaceful transition of power, and believes that the DOJ can likely elicit testimony relevant to an investigation under a federal statute that bans rebellion against the U.S. government. That statute says anyone who \"incites\" or \"gives aid or comfort\" in any \"rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States,\" cannot hold public office.The committee\u2019s unprecedented criminal referral holds no official legal weight, and a final determination in whether to pursue the charges will be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department.TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM LATEST JAN. 6 HEARING BEFORE MIDTERM ELECTIONS INCLUDE TRUMP SUBPOENA, NEW VIDEO Former President Donald Trump faces criminal referrals from the House Jan. 6 Committee. Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesThe committee also referred several GOP House lawmakers Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Scott Perry, R-Pa., to the House Ethics Committee for not complying with subpoenas.A spokesperson for Jordan responded to the committees referral in statement to Fox News: \"This is just another partisan and political stunt made by a Select Committee that knowingly altered evidence, blocked minority representation on a Committee for the first time in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, and failed to respond to Mr. Jordan\u2019s numerous letters and concerns surrounding the politicization and legitimacy of the Committee\u2019s work.\"Over its 18-month tenure, the committee obtained access to tens of thousands of documents, the committee has conducted nearly 1,000 interviews related to the Capitol protests.

  "text": "Tucker: What really happened on Jan 6 Tucker Carlson Tonight host shows how the media uses history as a tool to distort the truthThis is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" September 23, 2021. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.In March of 1971, a bomb went off inside the U.S. Capitol Building. There was never any question about who did it, a Marxist group called the Weather Underground immediately took responsibility for it even before the explosions.The Weathermen were not ashamed of what they did, they planned to overthrow the U.S. government and they wanted everyone to know it, yet even at the time, many Americans were not aware of this because the media immediately began telling a very different story about what happened.\"The Washington Post\" for example explained that the radical left wasnt actually to blame for the Capitol bombings, instead the culprit was something far more general something called, quote: \"The easy contagion of extremism in a time of dark frustrations and deep disillusionment,\" whatever that means, it probably meant there was a Republican President at the time.The actual bombers meanwhile remained welcome in polite society. Years later, one of them became a quote, \"distinguished professor\" at a supposedly prestigious American university, if you can imagine.Even now, 50 years after the fact, the whitewash of that day continues. POLITICO just ran a long piece telling us that the real villain in the 1971 terror attack on the Capitol was Richard Nixon, who by the way was not there. But according to POLITICO, the bombing quote, \"Supercharged Nixons paranoia,\" and in the end led to Watergate.The story ends this way, \"Fifty years on, it seems remarkable how fast the 1971 attack faded from collective memory.\" Oh, but is it remarkable? Maybe not so remarkable. Leftists commit violence and the media covers for them? Thats something most of us are highly familiar with. Its been happening for a very long time.To this day, there are still a lot of Americans who think a right-winger killed JFK. Of course, the gunman was a person so committed to communism that he actually defected to the Soviet Union, but the media told the public it was a conservative, so many believed them.The point here, the lesson that you should remember is that the first draft of history very often is a lie, and its not an accidental lie, its intentional. Partisans understand that history is among other things, a tool and they can use it to accumulate power. So they lie about something to suit their ends, they keep lying about it and before long, their lies are recorded as truth. Theyre on Wikipedia and your kids believe them.Now, weve watched this happen all this year in real time, were living through distorted history as we watch the offense of January 6th described by everyone. Here is how the media describe what happened that day that day.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPTARA SETMAYER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That day will be another day that lives in infamy in American History similar to Pearl Harbor and 9/11.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER D-NY: We can now add January 6, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American History that will live forever in infamy.JOE BIDEN D, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: A hundred and fifty days since the worst single act of political violence since the Civil War.CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: The worst attack on American democracy arguably probably since the Civil War.SCHUMER: The greatest attempted insurrection since the Civil War.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The 1/6 attacks are likely to kill a lot more Americans that were killed on the 9/11 attacks.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Though there was less loss of life on January 6th, January 6th was worse than 9/11.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: For the record, we really try our hardest not to put liars, people we know who lie for a living on television because its irresponsible, other channels do it every day.But because were literal, lets go through the evidence here. Only one person was killed on January 6th, and that person was an unarmed female protester who was shot in the neck without warning by a Capitol Hill police officer who happens to have a publicly documented history of extreme recklessness.The protesters meanwhile killed no one and yet, they are telling you that those protesters were worse than the Imperial Japanese Army that attacked Pearl Harbor, killed thousands of Americans and led to the Second World War, the biggest war in history. They are also by the way worse than al- Qaeda.So as a talking point, as a political talking point, that seems a little -- how do you say -- over the top, actually kind of insane. But no, its apt. Everybody argued that what we saw on January 6th was exactly like 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Civil War, including a guy who writes popular histories for airport bookstores.He assured us that historically speaking, those comparisons are entirely valid. Heres that historian on NBC.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPMICHAEL BESCHLOSS, NBC NEWS PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Think of the 6th of January, if those terrorists who committed that attack on our Capitol had been a little bit faster, they could have and probably would have executed the Vice President, executed the Speaker of the House, executed other Members and leaders of Congress.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: They probably would have, therefore they were as bad as people who actually did. Now you look at that and you say, well that guy is stupid and thats fair, by the way, but then you look at 15 other guys just like him saying exactly the same thing and you have to ask yourself, why are they all saying exactly the same thing? Maybe theres a purpose here.And that might lead you to ask, what actually happened? And how can we find out? How do we make up our minds for ourselves? Its clearly a significant day in American History. Its being used to change the country, so maybe we should get to the actual facts of that day, what are they?Well, it turns out the Biden administration didnt want to tell us what they were. They refused to release thousands of hours of surveillance footage taken from within the Capitol on January 6th. Why wouldnt they want us to see that? Well, were not sure, but we know they really didnt want us to see it. In fact they went to court to keep that footage under seal.In one court document, the Department of Justice argued that releasing that footage from January 6 would -- and were quoting here -- \"compromise the security of the United States Capitol and those who work there.\" They went on to say that that footage might quote, \"create a visual pathway where other bad actors could use in planning their breach point and pathway for future attacks.\"No word if ISIS-K was involved in those plans or even if ISIS-K in fact exists, but thats not the point. The point is, they cant let you see the video because its just too dangerous to American National Security.Keep in mind, the Capitol is a public building which technically speaking you own, youve probably been inside because until the other day you were allowed to because its your country or was.So the idea that youre not allowed to see the inside of the Capitol is insane. The idea that the public has a clear interest in knowing what happened that day is real.So the footage weve seen up to this point shot by journalists and citizens contradicted the official story line. Here for example is the Chewbacca guy wandering around the Senate, this is the dangerous terrorist, this is the al-Qaeda operative. This is the Tojo of January 6th, wandering around the senate chamber looking a lot more like a confused street performer than a dangerous terrorist.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey [bleep] man. Glad to see you guys. You guys are patriots. Look at this guy, he is covered in blood. God bless you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You good, sir? Do you need medical attention?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Im good, thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got shot in the face. I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will. Ive been making sure they aint disrespecting the place.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, I just want to let you guys know this is like the sacredest place.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: So you look at the guy in the Viking horns, the Chewbacca guy and you may reach the obvious conclusion, maybe psilocybin mushrooms arent good for you, and thats fair. But no honest person could look at that video and decide America is under attack from terrorists.So then you have to ask, is that what the rest of the so-called insurrection look like?Well, now we have an answer because a Federal Judge just rejected the Biden administrations strenuous attempts to hide the surveillance footage from January 6th.So footage was just released. It was obtained by BuzzFeed. It covers 15 minutes on January 6th from 2:25 p.m. to 2:40 p.m. Eastern and those are key moments in the so-called insurrection.Now right now, youre seeing images from a surveillance camera positioned at the entrance to the Senate wing of the Capitol. You dont see people hiding bombs or using bayonets or firing weapons, trying to take over the country in an insurrection.You see people walking around and taking pictures. They dont look like terrorists, they look like tourists, and all of them by the way are Americans.The rest of the footage including shots from surveillance cameras outside the crypt of the Capitol is similar to this. You can look it all up by the way, its online right now and you should because you will notice that contrary to what the Department of Justice, were going to have to start putting air quotes around that, contrary to what D.O.J. claimed, none of the footage shows a secret route into the Capitol. Oh, that ISIS-K could use.So why did they keep this from us? Well, here is one theory. You can compare the footage released today was what Democrats showed us during the impeachment hearings earlier this year.Take a look at this. It is surveillance footage showing a squad of people dressed in all black systematically entering the Capitol and kicking open one of the exterior doors on the Senate side. These people appear to be well-trained and coordinated. Theyre not high in hallucinogenic mushrooms.The question is: who are they? And why dont we know their names? And why arent they dressed like any of the other people in the footage that was just released?Remember, we were attacked for saying this, but weve already been vindicated for it. We still dont know how many Federal agents were involved in the events that day on January 6th, but we have very good reason to believe from court documents that its a significant number.And heres one clue. At a recent rally in Washington, the Feds managed to arrest one of their own undercover agents. There were so many Feds at the event that they lost track of each other and arrested one of them.So we ask once again, how many Federal agents were there on January 6th? Why cant we know? What is clear is that once again, this footage reveals the first draft of history was a total lie, an intentional distortion, a mirage created to control you. It was the work of a specific political party. It was the work of the Democratic Party.So, it turns out, the vast majority of people inside the Capitol on January 6 were peaceful. They were not insurrectionists, they shouldnt have been there. They werent trying to overthrow the government. Thats a total crock.And with that in mind, some of the other lies about January 6th start to make more sense. Do you remember this?BEGIN VIDEO CLIPANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the hours-long attack.NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: They beat a Capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher.COOPER: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He died at the age of 42 after he was bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: So heres a rule of thumb going forward if you ever watch television again or read the newspaper, when they are absolutely insistent that you believe something, when they keep beating you over the head with the same talking point again and again and again, beware. Theres a reason theyre saying when all of them are using exactly the same line, maybe theres a reason for that. Maybe its coordinated. Maybe theyre lying.In this case they were lying. Brian Sicknick was not murdered. There is no evidence of that at all. The Medical Examiner said he died of a stroke.So the reason they told you that was because they wanted to establish a storyline before all the facts were in. Thats a common theme for virtually everything that happens in the news right now, you will notice.Something happens, youre not exactly sure what the outline is, you dont know all the facts, nobody does, and all of a sudden they hang a story on it that helps them politically and they ram it down your throat, day after day after day. They used to be called propaganda, now its so ubiquitous, I dont know what to call it.You remember the lies that you heard again and again about the McCloskeys in St. Louis who were white supremacists, or the Covington kids who were, of course, also white supremacists.Remember how they claimed that George Floyd was choked to death even though an autopsy showed he was not choked to death and he had a fatal level of fentanyl in his system and zero signs of suffocation? Thats what it said. Were not making that up.What medical reports dont matter anymore? Thats true.Remember what they said about how the laptop showed that Hunter Biden was selling access to his father for years, but no it wasnt real?BEGIN VIDEO CLIPUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ... super spreader events and giving Russian disinformation, spreading Russian disinformation.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Disinformation that he knows to be fabricated and supplied by a foreign Intelligence Service, and despite the warning, he is still doing it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have said this entire thing is so obviously a Russian plot.JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Its sort of a crazy quilt at this point, which has all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. That said, it wasnt for lack of trying.WALLACE: Rudy basically functioning as a Russian asset by pushing Russian disinformation.BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: CNN reported on Friday, the U.S. authorities are saying, if those e-mails we just talked about are connected to an ongoing Russian disinformation effort.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: These people are so shameless. They know theyre being used by liars in the Democratic Party, in the so-called Intel Community, and they just mouth the words anyway. They say whatever theyre told to say, and then of course the tech community gets involved and shuts down all conversation about it.Facebook and Twitter censored \"The New York Post\" for reporting the truth. Joe Biden went on stage in a presidential debate and repeated the lie.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPJOE BIDEN D, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in a situation where we have foreign company -- countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own National Security adviser told him that what is happening with his buddy, well I shouldnt -- well, I will -- his buddy, Rudy Giuliani, he is being used as a Russian pawn. He is being fed information that is Russian -- that is not true.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: They all knew it was true at the time. They knew within hours of the first \"New York Post\" story that really was the contents of Hunter Bidens laptop, everybody knew it, everybody, especially, Joe Biden. His text and e-mails were all over the laptop. Of course, he knew they were real. He wrote them.But the media lied on his behalf then Biden got elected because they covered for him and now that he is President, they can admit in fact its all true. Too late, its true.POLITICO finally got around to confirming that every bit of \"The New York Post\" reporting on Hunter Bidens laptop was absolutely accurate. It wasnt Russian disinformation, it was totally real.When are they going to admit there was no insurrection? Never.Candace Owens is the host of \"Candace,\" and were always grateful to have her on the show. Candace Owens, thanks so much for joining us. So when are they going to -- I mean, how do they explain away this footage from inside the Capitol on January 6th, our Pearl Harbor, our 9/11, our Civil War -- that shows people kind of wandering around sort of wondering how they got there?I mean, whatever these people are, they are trespassers clearly, but theyre not a crack team of QAnon insurrectionists like theyre just not.CANDACE OWENS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, these people look like theyre walking around a museum. It is the truth. I looked at the footage and I was absolutely shocked that they went through such tremendous effort.Talk about Russian disinformation. No. Its Department of Justice misinformation. Our Department of Justice has really launched a concerted effort to divide the American people. They have been lying left and right, front and center from the very beginning and they have no shame.The idea they had to lock down these tapes because of National Security -- are you kidding me, Tucker -- its not National Security, its fake news security, right? They have their propaganda arm. They have their MSNBC, they have their CNN, and they want to make sure that the American people believe the constant effort to psychologically brainwash the American people by saying, dont worry about seeing anything, were going to tell you what happened in there.And you know what? Its sick that they said that this was akin to Pearl Harbor, this is akin to 9/11. How insulting to the victims that actually endured those real tragedies?I mean, theres no limit that they wont go. There is no limit that they wont go through. Its so extreme this rhetoric, and I also want to say this. Looking beyond this entire situation, the most embarrassing thing is that theyre not thinking about internationally how embarrassing this looks for the American people.Think about when Vladimir Putin sat down with MSNBC and they said to him, look what you do to political dissidents? And he basically laughed in their face and said, look at what you do your political dissidence. He brought up January 6th, and you know what? Vladimir Putin was right. We no longer have the moral high ground in the international community because of this, because we have made an absolute mockery in terms of January 6th, and we have locked up political dissidents and those political dissidents are Trump supporters.CARLSON: I think poor Chewbacca guy who clearly posed no threat to anyone, maybe himself, but certainly not our Republic, I think hes still in jail. Why is no one in Congress saying anything about that?OWENS: Yes, and not even that. I mean, I remember reading a story about a teenager that was imprisoned for months and months. He was begging, writing to the judge, please, let me go. Think about this now weighed against the Black Lives Matter protest, right?I lived in D.C. during this time. They burned our city for six weeks and we have people signing up saying that we have to make sure that we bail them out of prison immediately and guess what, by and large, they were bailed out of prison immediately no matter what they did, because it was considered justice. Social justice, theyre allowed to do whatever they want even the middle of a pandemic.And then you have these people which essentially, it was a grandma selfie party. Once they got into the Capitol Building, it was a grandma selfie party. There were American flags. They were wandering around aimlessly and they left.And you know what? There seems to be different consequences for those people when weighed against the Black Lives Matter protesters who were burning entire churches to the grounds and pulling statues down with rope in D.C.CARLSON: Weve been talking about this story for eight months and the phrase \"grandma selfie party\" never occurred to me and Im ashamed. Im feeling it, going forward.Candace Owens, it is so good. Thanks a lot.Well, a business insider reporting today that when Joe Biden was the Vice President, Hunter Biden sought a retainer of $2 million a year to help quote, \"unfreeze\" money that belonged to the Libyan government. If thats true, thats very serious.Youll remember that Hillary Clinton had Muammar Gaddafi, the head of Libya killed for reasons nobody ever explained, completely destroyed the country and the lives of people who live there, and then money from the Treasury was impounded.If Hunter Biden was actually lobbying the U.S. government while his dad was Vice President to get that money, thats a very big deal, its probably a crime.Meanwhile, Ben Schreckinger of POLITICO is out with a book that confirms that Hunter Bidens laptop is not fake, its not Russian disinformation, the laptop contains evidence that the Biden family was in fact selling access to Joe Biden to entities in China and Ukraine, and many other countries.A year ago, POLITICO reported that the Intelligence Community thought the laptop was quote, \"Russian disinformation.\" Why are they telling us this now? Not that we ever believe their lies.Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist, very independent. He writes on \"Substack.\" He joins us tonight.So Glenn, I mean, I dont think youre shocked by this, but you do have to ask it. Why are they telling us this now?GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: The evidence was overwhelming from the very beginning, Tucker, that the e-mails were authentic, and yet they lied and lied and lied as you just showed trying to convince people to not even pay attention to them on the grounds that they were disinformation that the e- mails were fake.Now, the new book that just came out is from this young reporter at POLITICO who spent months digging into all of these e-mails and obviously, he unearthed proof that these e-mails were forgeries and put that in his book, he would be a star. You would know his name, hed be a household name, hed be on every TV show.But because his reporting that said the opposite, he found even more proof that all those e-mails were authentic, which meant that these media outlets, all of them pretty much, with a few exceptions deliberately lied to the public in the weeks before the election by telling them that this was Russian disinformation when they knew it wasnt true. They are ignoring his book.He is not a right-wing journalist, he is from one of those mainstream publications. He has the proof in his hands that they all lied and they dont want anyone to know it.CARLSON: Do you honestly think that they -- if youre NBC News, if youre CNN, if youre \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post,\" can you just sort of move forward as if you didnt participate in a lying campaign to influence a political election?GREENWALD: You know, as you know, Tucker, I was at the media outlet that I founded when this all happened and they were the ones who published as well the claim that this was Russian disinformation and then a week later told me that I couldnt report on this story because the documents werent verified in contrast to the C.I.A. lie that they had published.So all throughout the media, this is their prevailing mindset. They know that they have an audience filled with liberals who hate Donald Trump and the Trump movement, and their only business model is to aggrandize those people. And they know that even if they lie and get caught lying, their audience and readers dont care. In fact, like them even more, because they believe theyre on the right side.So you have huge number of journalists who believe that, they have the right to lie and even when they get caught, they dont care because they know their audience wont hold it against them.CARLSON: You came on, I think, immediately after you left \"The Intercept\" and I thought it was sad then, but looking back on it, the media outlet that you founded tried to make you lie or prevented you from telling the truth. I mean, that just really sums up the moment were living in.Im really sorry that you went through that. I just think its awful in every way, but youre thriving, obviously.Glenn Greenwald, thank you.GREENWALD: Yes, thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So, hows our immigration system going? Well, Haitians trying to get into the country are now biting I.C.E. agents. By the way, there should be a rule. We should not be importing people who bite. Period. Thats got to be a deal killer. Is it in the Constitution? No. Is it in a Federal law? No. But its commonsense. If you bite, you cant come here.Meanwhile, other migrants have commandeered a D.H.S. bus. The mayor of one border town has a solution to all these problems. He is living with the effects, he joins us next.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: Thousands of migrants remain in Del Rio, Texas at this hour. A number of the Haitians have now left the encampment, youre seeing on your screen. The White House conceded today that it has no idea where they are, where they went. We should just pause and note that this is not a disaster, its not a crisis, this is criminal behavior.This is the executive branch of government intentionally subverting Federal law, encouraging the breaking of American law, abetting crimes. This is criminal behavior.And the White House is doing nothing about it because they caused it. They did just announce the Border Patrol is now prohibited from using horses at the border because the real crime is against the people trying to break into our country, not against the country itself.Notice all of our time has been spent concerned about the people trying to break our laws and none of the time in the national media or even in our national political conversations in either party has been devoted to the Americans who are suffering because of this, which is all 340 million of us, but it is particularly the Americans who live in South Texas, towns like Uvalde.Don McLaughlin is the mayor of Uvalde, Texas he joins us tonight for an update on how things are going.Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for coming on. How are things going?MAYOR DON MCLAUGHLIN, UVALDE, TEXAS: Well, thank you for having me. Its pretty much a clown show. I mean, its -- the border is wide open, all the checkpoints are closed from West Texas all the way to below Del Rio.The foot traffic has increased tenfold. The human smuggling has increased tenfold. There are no Border Patrol agents available. Theyre all down at Del Rio processing Haitians.It is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier and these peaceful immigrants, illegal immigrants they keep talking about are getting more and more aggressive with landowners. Theyre doing more destruction to property. Theyre tearing things up, trashing ranch houses, trashing vehicles, and you know you can complain all you want, but this administration turns a blind eye to it.This is such a failed administration and a failed President. It is terrible.CARLSON: Its shocking. Well, it is criminal. Theyre abetting crimes. Will you or anybody else in your community or in that region expect to get reimbursed by the Federal government for the damage caused by these new Democratic voters that theyre letting in?MCLAUGHLIN: Well, I said -- now, you mentioned, I sent today pictures on a piece of property that we have where they trashed the property, cut the fences and two times have pictures of them walking across the property and I sent that out to all my federally elected officials today since Immigration is the governments baby, who do I send the bill to for making these repairs?I havent got a response yet.CARLSON: Yes, I suspect you wont.MCLAUGHLIN: Nor has any other rancher down there.CARLSON: The rest of the country really -- I mean, I think were all going to be affected by this, but youre affected by it first and most profoundly. You know, just our hearts go out to you.Mayor Don McLaughlin of Uvalde, Texas, thanks for coming on tonight.MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sir. Thank you.CARLSON: So if you ever wondered if the national media is not really a bunch of different programs or networks, but one big machine designed to take over your brain and feed you a steady diet of lies, rest assured thats exactly what it is. We know that because several late night TV hosts just gathered together for a special event. They renounced comedy and decided on a new direction --- propaganda.Matt Walsh was watching. Hes got a review for us straight ahead.Also right no on tuckercarlson.com, you can get the new book, if you like. Well be right back.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: So it used to be if you had a late night TV show, your job was to entertain people. Its late, people are tired, they want to be amused. They want to laugh, you give them comedy.But the rules have changed. Now, if you have a late night TV show, your job is to provide wooden corporate propaganda at full force. Beat people over the head with talking points until they submit. Thats what theyre doing.Last night, seven late night hosts gathered for a special climate -- on climate. Can you imagine how fun that was? And how honest.Here are some of it.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPJIMMY KIMMEL, TALK SHOW HOST: If you are a person living on this planet, your future is in peril. Thats a scientific fact and yes, there are other issues that are all very important. The pandemic, systemic racism, income inequality, immigration, gun violence.But heres the thing, if we dont address climate change, none of those issues will matter at all. The car is going off a cliff and were fiddling with the radio.We are way past climate denial.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Oh, yes. Oh weve got to act soon and you have to give us more power or else youll die, because it turns out the root cause of climate change is not actually carbon, its you.You did it.Stephen Colbert explained that people who believe in God are responsible for climate change.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPSTEPHEN COLBERT, TALK SHOW HOST: Are you saying -- are you saying that individual actions are useless because these corporations are the real problem?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.COLBERT: Oh good, because Im not 0--UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Its also religion.COLBERT: Sorry.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The concept of an afterlife gives you people the false hope of an escape hatch.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Oh religious people, right. Theyre the ones who murdered tens of millions of people in the 20th Century. It wasnt the atheists. Colbert was honest enough to acknowledge he doesnt follow any of these climate rules because theyre for you, not him.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPCOLBERT: And I mean this sincerely, Im a huge hypocrite. Ill never do anything thats inconvenient to me. Thats why there has to be systemic change backed up by government action to make everyone make the right choices, not the easy ones.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Wait a second, if someone forces you to do something, its not really a choice, is it? You cant make someone make the right choices. That doesnt even make sense. If you make someone do something, its a command. That person is your slave. You own that person. No choice involved. Not to be pedantic.Matt Walsh hosts \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" He joins us now. Did you watch this thing?MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": ... for climate change to be honest. I mean, it was -- Im ready for the ice caps to just melt. Im sorry if the polar bears are collateral damage, but its just -- I watch these things and I wonder first of all, who is watching late night TV on a regular basis?I watched the clip of Seth Meyers. Who is watching Seth Meyers on purpose? I have to assume his entire audience is like alcoholics who passed out on the couch because Ive seen boiled cabbage thats funnier than him.But what we know -- and I thought that from Colbert was interesting there, Im not going to give him any credit, but at least he is admitting his hypocrisy and cowardice because all of these people, its just like COVID, all of these people who are telling us to be scared of this and paranoid about it and to make changes, theyre not that scared and theyre not making any changes at all to their own lives.I mean, they are still doing shows. They are blaring the lights, theyre having celebrities come out on jets to sit on the couch and have conversations with them, burning all that jet fuel. They are not -- they refuse to make any changes whatsoever and here is the thing, Im not making any changes because of climate change, but thats because I dont believe what theyre telling me. I dont believe it, okay.So, if Im wrong then, Im just wrong, but if you really believe that the world is going to end if we dont make a change and you refuse to make a change yourself, then youre like a mass murderer, youre a sociopath on top of being a hypocrite.CARLSON: Its a little weird, dont you think, for all the networks to come together to broadcast the message of the political party in charge? Its a little strange. I mean like, if in 2018 all the networks got together to do a special on how we need to build a border wall and Mexico has to pay for it, youd be like wow, thats a little bit like government TV at that point, right?I mean, how is that different from the Ministry of Truth?WALSH: Yes, its -- theyre not trying to hide it at all anymore. We know that. I mean thats why the death -- theyre worried about the death of the planet. I think the death of comedy is something they should also be worried about especially with late-night TV.That is actually a real problem. We actually need comedy in a society and its important to have comedians who are going to hold the people in power to account and are going to sort of make fun of the sacred cows. That is actually an important service, but these people are refusing to do it.CARLSON: Yes, I mean theres a reason apart from his own obvious native talent that Gutfeld is beating all of these guys because Gutfeld is actually funny, you know.But if people are coming into FOX News for their late night comedy, you know what these guys are making? $12 million a year are losing to us. It tells you a lot. Anyway, good for Gutfeld.Matt Walsh thank you so much.WALSH: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.CARLSON: So theres no reason that people should have to wait until they need to be hospitalized to get treatments for COVID. But that is effectively the truth for a lot of people in this country.There are treatments for COVID you can get early so maybe you wont wind up on a ventilator and die. No one wants to talk about those for some reason, but we do. Well tell you what we found, next.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: So if you get your medical news from cable news, you might have reached the conclusion the only two ways to respond to COVID are get the vaccine or go on a ventilator, but there should be other options, right?Well in fact, there is new evidence that several drugs and drug combinations might effectively treat COVID before you wind up on a ventilator. For some reason, youre not allowed to talk about this. Thats a separate conversation, but what is that?In any case, Marc Siegel is a FOX News medical contributor who has been on this stuff since the very first day, since March of 2020. He joins us now to give us the latest. Dr. Siegel, thanks for coming on.DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker. As you know, Im a big proponent of the vaccine, but I get questions every day from my patients and around the country. I got COVID despite the vaccine or I got COVID, I didnt have the vaccine but what do I do now? What treatments do you have? What are your answers?And there are actually many. First of all aspirin was just studied at George Washington University and aspirin alone, a simple aspirin decreases your risk of going on a ventilator or ever getting that far by 50 percent. Vitamin D was studied in Scotland and in Ireland, and Tucker, vitamin D and sunlight decreases your risk of getting very sick from COVID. Thats another one.We talked about remdesivir on this show last February and now it turns out new data, if you get remdesivir, the antiviral very early on, the chances of you going into the hospital goes down by 87 percent and weve been talking a lot about those monoclonal antibodies that were using it a lot in the south right now.Lilly, Regeneron, if you get that early, your chances of ever getting hospitalized decrease by 70 percent. All of this, you can have right now.Coming down the pike, Tucker, even more exciting drugs. Youve got Merck working on a drug named molnupiravir, that drug stops the virus in its tracks, stops it from replicating. It looks like thats going to be out before the end of the year. Thats going to be the Tamiflu that we are going to use for this COVID.And Pfizer has another drug thats very similar to what we already use for HIV. That looks very, very effective.So Im saying to myself, wait a minute, I thought this pandemic was all about politics, right? Politics this, mask mandates, mandates, so I talked to the top medical historian I know in the world and I said how will this pandemic be remembered, Tucker? And he said, this pandemic will be remembered for what we learned in the field of science -- Tucker.CARLSON: Yes, I mean, I wish more people knew that there are steps you can take after you know youve been infected to radically lessen the chances that youre injured or killed by this and I dont think most people know that, and I think thats weird.SIEGEL: Also steroids, Tucker. Also steroids, you can take steroids. If youre in the hospital, the steroids you take will probably or possibly save your life.CARLSON: Well, Chris Cuomo recovered, so I guess that that might have helped him. I appreciate it. Dr. Siegel, thanks so much for coming on.SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.CARLSON: Just kidding. So you might remember the greatest video of the year, the one woman in the City of Los Angeles who still tells the truth, a biological man walking around with everything hanging out at in a womens spa in LA and she pointed out what? Thats a man. Interesting case, and kind of an upsetting one actually. There is a major development in it tonight. Well bring it to you, next.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: You may remember this video from June. It shows a woman, a hero, a national treasure pointing out what nobody else at the Wi Spa in Los Angeles felt like they could say out loud. There was a biological man walking around the spa with his biological man parts visible. Heres what she said.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Its okay for a man to go into the womens section show his penis around the other women, young little girls underage, your spa, Wi Spa condone that. Is that what youre saying?Like I asked. Its so -- he could stay there. He could stay there?What sexual orientation? I see a [bleep]. It lets me know hes a man. He is a man. He is a man. He is not no female.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: \"Hes a man, he is not no female.\" So here you have a black lady being completely honest about what she sees, and in so doing calling into question the core tenets of transgender ideology and the core tenet, of course is you can change your sex just by wishing itself.So this is a massive threat for the people telling lies on this subject, including \"Slate.\" So all people like that dismiss this incidence as a hoax, but it turns out it was not a hoax. Andy Ngo actually did some reporting on this. He confirmed its absolutely real, and tonight he has new details on the case to share with us.Andy Ngo is a journalist. Hes the author of \"Unmasked: Inside Antifas Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy,\" and were happy to have him tonight. Andy, thanks so much for coming on.So this story just kind of keeps going. Where is it now?ANDY NGO, JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR, \"UNMASKED\": Yes, the latest development is that the suspect in the Wi Spa incident, that is Darren Merager is now a fugitive.Earlier this month, a judge in Los Angeles County issued a second arrest warrant because Merager missed a court date for another felony indecent exposure case that is open right now. Ive been able to find out some additional details about the two current open criminal cases into Merager. So one is the Wi Spa, the other is an incident that allegedly happened in late 2018 in West Hollywood at a swimming pool locker room, and the alleged victims involved children that are as young as 10 years old.CARLSON: Girls?NGO: Yes. And I interviewed Merager again and she maintains her innocence and she says that she has not had any sex reassignment surgery and that her large appendage is being mistaken by other people for an erection.I also found out the details in the 2003 felony indecent exposure conviction that led to Merager being a mandated registered sex offender in the State of California. The details of that is, she was convicted over masturbating at the window of the home of an elderly woman in Southern California.CARLSON: Yes, so what we used to call flashers are now part of a protected class and the Human Rights campaign pays for their legal bills. Really grotesque. Andy Ngo, I know youve taken a lot of crap for going deeper into the story and I appreciate that you did. Thank you very much.NGO: My pleasure.CARLSON: Were out of time tonight, unfortunately. Well be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. and every week night. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.We have a surprise for you, ladies and gentlemen. Up next, for the nine oclock hour is The Great Sean Hannity. He takes over now.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2021 VIQ Media Transcription, Inc.

  "text": "Tucker: Jan. 6 was not a terrorist attack \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 host discusses the media\u2019s response to Jan. 6 on the eve of its one-year anniversary.This is a rush transcript of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on January 5, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Oh, welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Oh. Sorry. Pardon the good cheer, solemnity is called for.Today is January 5th, or as it will henceforth be known to all civilized peoples around the world, January 6 Eve.Tonight at midnight, just hours from now, we will begin the first of many annual remembrances of the horrifying atrocities that took place exactly one year ago at the United States Capitol.So how do you commemorate something like this history-changing event thats horrible to think about, yet so significant in the life of the country? Well, body counts are the traditional measure. When the nation was wracked by unimaginable loss in years past. Thats how we remembered it.Forty thousand casualties at Gettysburg, 2,400 lost to Pearl Harbor, nearly 3,000 Americans dead on 9/11. But this is a new time, a different age. Those antiquated metrics wont work as we observe a moment of silence for the fallen of January 6th.On January 6, there was -- lets see, actually there was just Ashli Babbitt. Ashli Babbitt was not a union soldier. Shes not a deckhand on the Arizona. She is not even a heroic fireman rushing into a collapsing office tower. She was merely a Trump voter.She was unarmed, she was shot to death without warning by a Capitol Hill police officer with a documented history of reckless behavior. In the end, Ashli Babbitt was the death toll on January 6th, but honestly, so what? Its not really about the numbers, is it? Its not about how many people were killed on January 6th.In fact, the list of those who werent killed on January 6th is quite long. Its impressively long. It includes all 535 Members of Congress, as well as their entire staff, and the Press Corps that covers them. None of them died. Theyre still around.But again, who cares? Its not about body counts. Its about feelings. Its about how the survivors feel, especially the reporters who survived.The feelings of reporters in Washington matter a great deal in America. They certainly matter a lot more than how you feel at the moment. How you feel, as youve probably noticed by this point is totally irrelevant to anyone. Nobody cares.But the journalists of Capitol Hill, we do care, and theyre very upset. In fact, many has still not recovered from what they saw that day, as they lie down to sleep at night, the horrible images replay in a loop on the back of their eyelids. The deafening thunder of cannon volleys, the smoke from the remorseless artillery fire blotting out the sun, the screams of the mortally wounded calling out for their loved ones echoing like some demonic soundtrack against the walls of the Speakers Lobby. Hell in a very small place.Unless you were there that day, you cannot possibly understand what it was like. Imagine the Tet Offensive plus Fallujah, plus the night before Thanksgiving at Whole Foods. On January 6, you couldnt tell who the enemy was, unless you looked down and saw they bought their shoes at Walmart, then you knew.But otherwise, it was the fog of war, my friends.Kasie Hunt was there that day. Hunt is now something called the chief national affairs analyst over at CNN. As a veteran of the siege of the Capitol, Hunt took to Twitter today to give hope to her fellow survivors. Quote: \"Tomorrow is going to be a tough one for those of us who were there or had loved ones in the building. Thinking of all of you and finding strength knowing Im not alone in this. #January6th.\"That was just a tweet.But someday, youve got to believe because this is a hopeful country that Hunt and her fellow survivors of the insurrection massacre of January 6th will come together in some more formal way. Annual reunions held in the shadow of Washington certain to be built January 6th Memorial, the one theyre going to have to bulldoze the Washington Monument to construct.Hunt and graying grizzled veterans of \"The Washington Post\" and Bloomberg News and POLITICO and \"The Daily Beast\" and \"The Atlantic\" Magazine will raise their white claws as one and remember how they cheated death that terrible day.Okay, well stop. Its too embarrassing. Were feeling shame even making fun of it. And in fact, as a political matter, anyway, the anniversary of January 6 is not a joke at all. Its a serious thing, a very serious thing.Pretending that a protest was actually a failed coup is the Democratic Partys entire strategy to win this years midterm election. At this point, its all theyve got. Governing didnt work.And thats why today, the Attorney General of the United States, one of the most political men in Washington, announced the Department of Justice will continue to harass and arrest people who voted for Donald Trump. Watch.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPMERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6 perpetrators at any level accountable under law whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy. We will follow the facts wherever they lead.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Everyone who was responsible. So the Department of Justice already had the largest manhunt in its history. John Dillinger is laughing from the pit of hell. January 6 trumped him, and it trumped the manhunt after 9/11. It trumps all man hunts.So people who are just staying there taking pictures on their phone got picked up by the F.B.I., some got sent to jail, but its not ending. There are still more to come.And of course, Merrick Garland never speaks alone. The chorus always joins him because they always move as one.Frank Figliuzzi, for example. He is a high F.B.I. official. He now works at quote, \"NBC News\" tweeted this prediction/observation, quote: \"Attorney General references Watergate. Get it? Merrick Garland pledges pursuit of January 6 suspects at any level.\"Oh, theres more, ladies and gentlemen, a former NBC executive called Mike Sington wrote this. \"Dont give up hope. Trump could still be arrested.\"Arrested for what? Because there wasnt room in the tweet to explain, but just arrested. Bad people should be arrested. Thats the point.What is interesting is that there are a lot of actual criminals who have got no space in the Garland speech today. Garland made no mention at all of the pipe bomber. Remember that -- oh, theres the pipe bomber right there. The pipe bomber of January 6, maybe it was January 5th actually.Were observing the anniversary of the pipe bomber right now. That individual was caught, we would say, man, but you know, we dont want to get too specific in the current environment. That person was caught in surveillance tape.The pipe bomber was on several phones, or one phone several times. Thats all traceable. Wheres that person? Merrick Garland didnt even mention it. Heres what he focused on instead.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPGARLAND: We have received over 300,000 tips from ordinary citizens who have been our indispensable partners in this effort. The F.B.I.s website continues to post photos of persons in connection with the events of January 6 and we continue to seek the publics assistance in identifying those individuals.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Oh, be sure to check the F.B.I. website. They are posting photos and not of people who actually work for them who were there that day. Theyre not only posting photos, theyre taking them off the site, including the most wanted list. Remember Ray Epps?He is on video several times encouraging crimes, riots, breaches of the Capitol on January 6th. He was on the F.B.I. website. Now, hes gone. He hasnt been charged with anything, apparently. Why is that? Thats a real question.No one in Congress seems to care, even supposedly conservative Republican senators. What are they busy doing? Well, theyre busy repeating the talking points that Merrick Garland has written for them. Here is one example.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPSEN. TED CRUZ R-TX: We are approaching a solemn anniversary this week, and it is an anniversary of a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol where we saw the men and women of law enforcement demonstrate incredible courage, incredible bravery, risked their lives to defend the men and women who serve in this Capitol.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Lets be honest, everyone who is conservative appreciates Ted Cruz. You may not like him, but youve got to appreciate him. Hes legitimately smart. Hes one of the more articulate people to serve in the Congress, maybe the most articulate. He doesnt use a single word by accident.Every word Ted Cruz uses is used intentionally. Hes a lawyer.He described January 6th as a violent terrorist attack. Of all the things that January 6th was, it was definitely not a violent terrorist attack. It wasnt an insurrection. Was it a riot? Sure. It was not a violent terrorist attack. Sorry.So why are you telling us that it was, Ted Cruz? And why are none of your Republican friends who are supposed to be representing us and all the people have been arrested during this purge saying anything? What the hells going on here?Youre making us think maybe the Republican Party is as worthless as we suspected it was. That cant be true. Reassure us, please. Ted Cruz?Well, for some perspective on all of this, we are about to speak to Charlie Hurt. He is a longtime reporter in Washington, one of the honest ones. He is now at \"The Washington Times\" and now he is in our studio childhood. Charlie Hurt, great to see you.CHARLIE HURT, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you, Tucker. So first of the media reaction. Youve been a reporter, youre about my age, right around 30 years-ish. Worked at a bunch of newspapers, seen a lot.Do you think January 6 is the most violent, terrifying event youve ever covered?HURT: No, not by a longshot. But I think -- but I do think its probably true that it is the scariest thing that a lot of these people have ever witnessed, which probably says a lot more about them and their life experiences than it does about that day. I dont know.CARLSON: Yes. I think thats a really smart point. I mean maybe if youre Kasie Hunt and youre running around \"Im a journalist. Im a hard news journalist\" like that qualified as Fallujah to you.HUNT: Yes, or if you think that earplugs are rubber bullets that have been shot at you, then youre probably in the wrong line of work. But there is a very important point here.Also, Im not belittling how traumatic it probably was for her and a lot of people and it was probably -- they probably do suffer from PTSD, and you know what that says to me, maybe they should find another line of work. Maybe this is not right for them.You expect them -- you know, if have a prospective juror who you want to put on your jury, if theyve witnessed a crime, if theyve been a victim of a crime, theyre usually stricken from being on the jury.How are these reporters who survived this day allowed to go and cover congressional hearings every single day where half the people on the panel are people who want -- who they believe what could kill them? They how can they be balanced, even-handed, honest reporters? I couldnt do that.CARLSON: Thats such a smart point. It does feel like the main hiring criterion for every influential position in this country is narcissism. Like the more solipsistic you are, the more likely you were to get the job --HUNT: Well, I mean, this is the perfect, you know -- theyve sort of run through the entire gambit of Twitter and there were no more tweets to send out. So January 6 is sort of the perfect encapsulation of the Twitter media.CARLSON: #January6. Im getting that tattoo someday.So lets talk about January 6, which was an actual event where crimes were committed.HUNT: Right.CARLSON: I believe that and from day one, weve been for prosecuting crimes, all crimes.HUNT: Absolutely.CARLSON: Including those. However, its become something much more than that and this being Washington, of course, its being used to political effect. How do you think Democrats believe January 6th will allow them to not lose in the midterms?HUNT: I think that they -- I dont know how well they thought it through. First of all, you know, obviously, these are the most sheltered people on Earth. They dont get out much. If they did get out a little bit more, they would realize nobody is talking about this.CARLSON: Is that true?HUNT: Nobody but they, themselves and the media, and you know, a few people who are obsessed with NPR News every morning are talking about this.CARLSON: Right.HUNT: No normal people, and Im talking about Democrats, mainly because if youre a senior Democrat voter and you live in Chicago, do you care more about that? Or do you care more about the BLM summer of hate, in which, you know, your neighborhood got torched.CARLSON: Yes, and dozens of people died.HUNT: Dozens of people died, government buildings were actually destroyed. You had cops killed. You know, is that more concerning to you? Or is this?And I think it just reveals the utter disconnect and its a real problem for Democrat politicians because of course, theyve got nothing better to sort of counter all of the mayhem that they inspired especially in the summer 2018. Theyve got nothing better, so thats why theyre talking about this.But the weird thing about it is, not only does it reveal how totally disconnected they are, but the more they talk about it, the more disconnected they become from those voters and its a real bad situation and I think that its just proof theyve given up on hoping to win.CARLSON: I think thats right. I mean, the real threat to democracy is how out of touch the people who run everything are from the people theyre supposed to be serving.HUNT: Yes. Completely.CARLSON: Charlie Hurt, it is so great to see you.HUNT: Great to see you.CARLSON: As it always is.Well, speaking of January 6th, we had a query the other day from a reporter at Yahoo News called Jon Ward.Jon Ward wanted to know if we thought \"Patriot Purge,\" that was our documentary on that day encouraged violence. And we said, of course it didnt. In fact, the documentary explicitly opposes violence, as this show does. Weve consistently denounced political violence of any kind, no matter who commits it, even in places like Yahoo News were giving a pass to the BLM rioters who killed dozens of Americans.So why dont you watch the documentary and youll find that out, we said. Well, I have watched, he replied, and he sent us this transcription from the documentary. Youll see it now on your screen.This is a quote from the very end of \"Patriot Purge,\" quote, \"Theyre pushing you toward violence, and theyre doing it on purpose ... Tell the truth, build the country. Love your family and each other. Be the light. Thats how it gets better.\"Now, I wrote that, thats my voiceover at the end of the documentary, but youll notice in that transcription theres a series of dots between two of those sentences. These are called ellipses. They signify that something has been removed from the original quote.So what was removed from this quote from our documentary, the phrase \"Dont fall for it\" was removed, as in, \"Theyre pushing you to commit violence, but dont fall for it.\" Thats what we said. We said it as clearly as we could. Remain peaceful. Dont commit violence. Love your fellow Americans, make the country better.\"If you dont believe us, you can watch the video yourself, if you like, and you should. Yahoo News watched it. Then they edited the transcript to suggest we were promoting violence.Its not often you see a clear example of media dishonesty. What can we learn for that?Well, as it happens, I know Jon Ward very well. He used to work for me. He and his family have been to our house. Hes a very nice person. Hes a sincere family man. Hes also weak, and in a moment like this, weak people get crushed by the forces above them.Weak people conform. They do what it takes. If you want to draw a salary from a big media company right now, you do what youre told. You toe the line. If it comes down to it, you lie.The whole thing is heartbreaking to watch. What an awful moment this is.Lieutenant Colonel Stu Scheller was fired and jailed because he criticized the withdrawal from Afghanistan. To this day, he is the only one who has been punished for it.Weve wanted to talk to him since he got out of jail. In a moment, he joins us for his first interview.Well be right back.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: Stu Scheller spent 17 years as a United States Marine Corps officer, five combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. To this day, Scheller remains the only person in the United States punished in any way for the debacle of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.He criticized it, they sent him to jail for it.We sat down for his first interview since leaving jail and it was fascinating. Here is part of it.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPSTUART SCHELLER, FORMER U.S. MARINE: So, this had been building up for a while. So, anyone that has been there and experienced it, its very personal. And so in the age that we live that was watching the Afghanistan plan fall apart before eyes, social media real time, it was very frustrating.And I was talking to my family, I was talking to my friends, I was having a real hard time with it. And then about a week previous to it, the Commandant of the Marine Corps released a white letter, it stated, you know, was your sacrifices worth it -- addressing all of us struggling with what we were struggling with. And he stated, if you are having trouble, you need to go seek therapy.But he never pointed out that anyone, any senior leader might be culpable for wrongdoings. And I saw that as him placing his loyalty to the other General officers and not to the junior enlisted.We could have all avoided the trip to the therapist had he admitted that senior leaders had fault. So I was angry about that. I was angry about how it was handled, and then a week later, the unit that got attacked was my first unit. When I was in Ramadi, my best friend got hit with an S-vest in 1-8. It came full circle to me.I was the Regimental Operations Officer that put 1-8 out on deployment. I knew all the Company Commanders. I knew the Battalion XO. I knew the Ops of it. I intimately knew this unit. And since then, I had moved on because to become Battalion Commander, and all of this just got to a point where I knew for a fact that no senior leader is going to be held accountable. I knew that I was going to be held accountable.But at a certain point, we need to publicly address our shortfalls or we are going to keep repeating the same mistakes. And so you know, even after I made that video, I made the video in my office, I didnt post it right away. I drove to my house and you know, youre outside your house, youve got your wife and your three kids inside the house.And Im pacing around the front of the house, like on my phone, like, you know, like the button away, knowing that thats going to change your life forever and I made the decision to put that out there.CARLSON: But why? I mean, everything you said, I think everyone understands your frustrations, but youre clearly smart. So you sort that maybe, you could go to jail for it. But you knew, you know, but you did it anyway. But why did you do that?SCHELLER: This has been my whole life. You know, my whole adult life has been dedicated to America, foreign diplomacy. I wrote a Masters thesis on how to make foreign diplomacy more effective.There is no one more personally invested than me. You know, Ive awards for valor. But all of that is irrelevant when you dont -- Im watching the junior service member win every tactical engagement in the future that our General officers right now are talking about the shift of the force, the National Security strategy, its all predicated on changes on the tactical level, how to ensure the force, distribute the operations. Thats all tactical other stuff.Weve won every tactical level engagement. What were losing at is the operational level where General McKenzie and the combatant commanders reside, and that link between the strategic level and the National Security Council, the Secretary of Defense and the President, those are the people that need to be addressed and be held accountable because these junior enlisted are going out there sacrificing everything.I would submit sacrificing more than the General officers are and theyre not getting the credit they deserve, and so you ask me like why I did it?CARLSON: And those are the men you command.SCHELLER: Yes, I was a Company Commander in multiple different commands. Ive been a Company Commander at the School of Infantry. I was a Company Commander at 3-2, a Weapons Company Commander and a Headquarters Company Commander. I was a Company Commander at the basic school for a bunch of officers.So cumulatively, Ive been a Company Commander for five years. I had been selected a Battalion Commander. I was in my Battalion Command seat for about two months before I made that video. So, it was pretty short lived and they fired me before dinner the next night, you know.So that was -- but I did it because not only was I personally invested. Following Vietnam, there was no General officers that were held accountable and the narrative thats told today is how the General officers had to basically clean up the draft generation and make good service members, but they never went back and held themselves accountable.And the exact same thing is happening right now. Theyre taking, hey the G- what generation doesnt know how to fight China, we need to change it. Its the tactical problems and theyre not focusing on the operational strategic problems, which are the same things that should have been addressed after Vietnam, and were not.And the reason that kind of got washed away is because we had a marginal success in Desert Storm in the 90s, and that just kind of threw us off in terms of the systemic changes that need to take place.And so all of those reasons are why I felt like, you know, its not my place to say it, and everyone pointed that out, but there is nobody else saying it. You know, theres just nobody else saying it.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Stu Scheller, a really brave man and an honorable man, exactly the sort of person you want defending your country.That whole conversation is available right now on FOX Nation. You can head over to tuckercarlson.com if you want to see it.Well, a teacher who is currently battling cancer has announced, he will continue teaching in-person despite demands for the teachers union to go remote, which means to stop teaching over the not at all dreaded omicron variant.That story is next.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: So were learning more tonight about just how fake the most basic COVID numbers are. Theyre totally fake. Theyre made up, they are lies.\"The LA Times\" just confirmed that a majority of the people listed as COVID patients in hospitals in LA are actually there for something else. Theyve merely tested positive for the virus.And COVID hospitalization is not the only thing youve been lied to about. Biden just announced this past summer that long COVID is real. Its a disorder, and its now a disability under Federal Disability Law. Watch.BEGIN VIDEO CLIPJOE BIDEN D, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Im proud to announce a new effort. The first of its kind to help Americans grappling with long term effects of COVID-19 that doctors call Long COVID.Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering challenges, like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain or fatigue. These conditions can sometimes -- can sometimes rise to the level of a disability.So were bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with Long COVID who have a disability have access to the rights and resources that are due under the Disability Law.END VIDEO CLIPCARLSON: Brain fog and fatigue. So, maybe thats a real syndrome, maybe its just Thursday. Its not clear this is even real. At least one study shows that most people who told physicians they had long COVID never even had COVID at all. One German study revealed that these patients brain showed no changes.So Alex Berenson has been following all of this stuff and a lot of stories that no one else is following. He is the author of the bestselling book \"Pandemia.\" He joins us now to assess.Alex Berenson, thanks so much for coming on. Look, I dont want to make fun of people suffering or their illnesses or their symptoms, which are, you know, probably real. But at some point, if this is going to qualify as a Federal disability, we have a right to know whether its a thing or not, is it?ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR: All right, yes, its a great question.Before I talk on COVID, I have to say one thing to you, which is I seem to say it every time I come on, Tucker, but thank you. You know, we were on the week the book came out and it is really because of you and Laura that its a bestseller, \"Pandemia\" did not get reviews anywhere. It essentially went under a media blackout.But you, you know, you talked about it a little bit and it was a best seller everywhere, \"The New York Times\" which wouldnt, you know, allow it on the list. So thank you for that. I really mean it.CARLSON: Your former employer, hilarious.BERENSON: My former employer, right. They would not, you know, drop water on me if I were on fire at this point. But you know what, so be it. Im telling the truth and whether they like it or not, thats the way it is.Long COVID. Okay, Long COVID is a joke, unfortunately, medically, it is -- and youre right, at the same time, we have to be aware that these people are really suffering, okay?CARLSON: Right.BERENSON: It is -- it is a lot like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome or these other sort of ill-defined disorders that have kind of taken over medicine or taking over parts of medicine in the last 30 years.There are people that especially sort of middle-aged women, theres a certain kind of person who fits this profile who is suffering from insomnia, fatigue, pain, depression, and they work pretty hard to medicalize their conditions.You know, men have their own ways of dealing with this. For men, its often back pain, it can be alcohol abuse. A lot of Americans these days are under a lot of stress, okay, and COVID made that worse.But that does not mean that this is a real medical condition. There is really no evidence that you know that a virus -- again, let me put it to you this way. If you are really sick with COVID, if you get stuck on a ventilator, if you get hospitalized, if you need oxygen support, youre going to have a recovery period and that recovery period can be significant.But thats not what these people want to talk about. They want to talk about people who had very few or no symptoms, who are never hospitalized, and who in many cases never actually had a positive COVID diagnosis and to claim that some period of time later, they became sick with long COVID and they are entitled to essentially welfare for the rest of their lives.And theres -- if were going to do that, we need some evidence that this is an actual illness with an actual biological course and we do not have that at all. I write about this in \"Pandemia.\" But actually more evidence has developed in just the last couple of months that suggests this really is not -- its not a biological illness, which again, doesnt mean these folks arent suffering with something.CARLSON: I get it. So the plan has always been to just like send every American a check every month, because thats what they want to do. Wouldnt it just be more straightforward to do that? You know, guarantee basic income.BERENSON: You know, I think it will. Yes, thats right. If thats what we want, then thats what we should do, but to make people pretend theyre sick actually worsens their conditions a lot of the time, and Ill never forget in 2008 talking to a rheumatologist about fibromyalgia, and he was very sincerely worried about these people he was treating.But he said, you know, they dont have an illness, and the more they hang around the medical system, the worse their problems become and thats the risk. Its not just that youre treating them with drugs they dont need, which can be very powerful. Its that they get to think of themselves as sick and then it becomes harder and harder for them to make the transition back to being healthy.CARLSON: Its right and its just so dishonest, like medical marijuana. If you want to legalize weed, do it, but dont pretend indica is chemotherapy. You know, its so insulting.BERENSON: Thats right.CARLSON: Alex Berenson, it is great to see you. Thank you.BERENSON: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So Democrats keep telling us that in order to save democracy, they have to pass a bill called the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. How surprised will you be to discover the bill does exactly the opposite of what its advertised to do? Well, weve got details straight ahead.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: So the John Lewis Voting Rights Act is the number one priority of Democrats in the Congress. Theyre so desperate to pass it before they get creamed in the midterms, or in order that they wont get creamed in the midterms, they are threatening to abolish the filibuster, which would change Congress forever, make it very different from what it is now.So if this bill becomes a law, the Federal government would have total veto power over voting in every State. It doesnt matter what the States do. The Federal government, the people in charge of it, would basically be able to rig any election, if they wanted.States would have to go to the Congress for permission to do anything. This is a huge change. Probably unconstitutional. States have no authority to require voter identification, for example, or registration at the polls. Voting ID laws in many states would be suspended immediately. States would not even have the power to dictate where the polling places are located.Under this bill, States would also lose control over redistricting within their own borders. It is a huge deal. It sounds kind of complex, Democrats are smart enough to if they control the way that elections are conducted. They control the outcome of the elections. Theyre not stupid -- like the other party.Victor Davis Hanson is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He is the opposite of stupid. He joins us tonight to assess. Professor, thanks so much for coming on. Give us your evaluation of this bill, if you would.VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, first of all, remember this is in reaction to the declining popularity of Joe Biden and his agenda. Remember, after he was elected, we were told that we had a good system, it was resilient. We got rid of the Trump threat and everything was going, and then in August, his polls crashed.So that is what is precipitating this need for it, and it is part of a larger landscape where were going to pack the Court, were going to get rid of the Electoral College, were going to bring in two States, and were going to get rid of the nine-person, 150-year-old Supreme Court because they have no confidence in the people.When they say democracy is broken in 2022 or 2024, they mean it doesnt work for us, and they -- you know, it is broken because were not in power maybe in two years. But I think it is an unconstitutional -- Section I of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 4, I should say, it says the States have the primary responsibility that the Federal government as it pleases, can intervene, 18-year-old vote, you know, womens suffrage.But if the States did not have the primary responsibility to set rules, they wouldnt be in the Constitution, and the Courts have decided that. So, what they want to do is turn over Wyoming or Utah or Indianas voting laws to some unelected people in the D.O.J. and weve seen what type of people have been confirmed lately, then theyre going to come in and say, you cant have -- you cant stop third-party vote harvesting. We need more mail-in ballots -- all the things they felt were pretty good in the last election.And theyre going to -- their main focus and obsession is voter ID, you know, and thats -- and so its a pseudo answer, and a pseudo solution in search of a pseudo problem because in 2012, Barack Obama remember had a higher margin of African-Americans turned out in greater numbers to vote for Barack Obama, primarily 96 percent.And then white voters, 2020, more people voted than ever, so the idea that youre suppressing the vote is a manipulation of language, and when they mean suppressing the vote, they are meaning, well, before you couldnt have 800,000 illegal aliens vote in New York municipal elections, now you can.As Nancy Pelosi and others have said, 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds should vote and ex-felons should vote. So thats what theyre trying to do is enlarge the electorate because they feel that it doesnt serve their electoral needs, and theyre going to need to get the filibuster eliminated or this thing wont pass, so as part of that larger package.You know what, finally, Tucker, were talking about January 6th, these guys are stone cold, revolutionaries. They are Jacobins. They know what theyre doing. They are 10 times more dangerous than that clownish group that went into the Capitol on January 6th.And theyre even more dangerous than the 120-day riot of continuous rioters who burned and looted and killed 30 people and injured 2,000 cops that we dont talk about in the summer of 2020.These are serious people that do not believe in the Constitution or the customs and traditions of the last century and they want to change the system to guarantee the results that otherwise they cannot achieve by the people.CARLSON: So nicely put. I listen to your talk, and I think he must be reading that. But I know that youre not, so Im doubly impressed. Thank you for that explanation.Victor Davis Hanson, good to see you.HANSON: Thank you.CARLSON: So people who care about New York and everyone should care about New York. It is our biggest city or whatever economy comes from New York -- realize that its kind of over at this point. Why? Because the new District Attorney in Manhattan, a man called Alvin Bragg was elected with of course, help from George Soros, has announced that his office will no longer seek prison sentences for very serious crimes.Armed robbery, for example, will be downgraded to petty larceny, et cetera et cetera. What will the effect of this be? Weve got someone who lives in New York, Seth Barron who is the Managing Editor of the \"American Mind,\" author of \"The Last Days of New York,\" sadly, prescient, he joins us now.So thanks so much for coming on.SETH BARRON, MANAGING EDITOR, \"AMERICAN MIND\": Oh, thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: Tell us what this Soros-backed prosecutor plans to do?BARRON: Well, I mean, you spelled it out. He wants to seek non-carceral solutions for almost any crime, except murder, rape, and then like, you know, corruption, white collar crimes.But as far as gun crimes, assault -- like the kind of street assaults that we see, he doesnt think that those merits jail. He doesnt want to have bail imposed at all, except for, you know, homicide cases and rape and maybe some domestic violence.So, you know, if you commit a crime, a serious crime, you could just walk. Hes got a completely revolutionary radical view of how criminal justice should operate in New York, and its very frightening.But the thing is, people are, you know, up in arms about it now that he is in, but this was his campaign. This is what he ran on.CARLSON: Good point.BARRON: He made these promises. He said he didnt think that gun crimes should necessarily bring jail.CARLSON: Wait a second. Thats very strange, though, because he is, of course, a left-wing Democrat. Hes a Soros puppet. But I thought left-wing Democrats were for taking peoples guns away or is Kyle Rittenhouse the only gun criminal in America or, you know, farmers with shotguns in their closets? They are the problem. Like how can he be against prosecuting gun crime?BARRON: Its a really interesting question. I think it depends on, you know, to who-whom type of question. You know, whos going to get arrested? Like he talks about how his dad had an illegal gun? And, you know, he had it for safety and protection. So it was okay.You know, I guess other people who have guns, maybe its not so good. You know, he doesnt think a gun should lead to a jail sentence unless its used. Well, you know --CARLSON: It is just what we are seeing. It is race based application of the law. I mean, thats -- lets just be honest, thats what it is. It is the equity agenda. Its what you look like matters most.BARRON: Well, given the fact that like 98 percent of gun crime in New York City is committed by, you know, blacks and Latinos, it does sort of -- it does sort of shake out that way.But, you know, I just want to say that everybody who was very excited about Eric Adams as the law and order mayor, back in July, Eric Adams came out openly and said that theres no difference between him and Alvin Bragg on criminal justice. So you know, were kind of in a sticky situation.CARLSON: We are. Some of us, speaking for myself was really hoping that Eric Adams would be better than the mayor he replaced. I still hope that, but signs arent good. Seth Barron, great to see you. Thank you.So after a lot of depressing stories, here is a genuinely inspiring one. A teacher who is currently battling cancer in Chicago has announced he will not go remote because of the non-deadly omicron variant. He wants to continue teaching his students even though the teachers union doesnt want him to.Pretty great. Were going to hear from him, next.COMMERCIAL BREAKCARLSON: The teachers union in Chicago has voted to stop teaching students in person. The union is going on strike and Chicago canceled classes today. Thats the bad news.But one teacher, a teacher who is battling cancer has refused to stop teaching students in person. That teacher is called Joe Ocol, and were honored to have him join us tonight. Mr. Ocol, thanks so much for joining us. Bless you for this. Tell us why youve made this decision.JOE OCOL, CHICAGO TEACHER: Oh, hello.CARLSON: Hello.OCOL: Well, in the previous strikes, I already made that decision because I joined the Chicago Public Schools, as a teacher, first and foremost as a teacher. And my role -- now, I believe my role should be inside the classroom with my students, it should not be in the picket line. I did not join CPS to be a union member. First and foremost, to be a teacher.And secondly, I believe that there are ways to fight City Hall. You dont dangle the plight of the kids in the middle of the fight just to secure demands. There are other ways. I believe, there are other ways.I have nothing against the union, but I have something against people using the union as a tool for political gain and thats my stand. And thats why I feel that despite my battling cancer, I still have a role to play right now and I just want to make my life relevant.Somehow the thought that I can still be of service to my students, and I can touch their lives and make a difference in their lives.CARLSON: Well, first of all, you made me cry. So please stop -- but I mean, the fact that you literally have cancer right now and youre fighting it, and youre not afraid or you think that your duty to the students is higher than your own, that the risk that youre taking on is just so inspiring, I think to the rest of us.Why do you think its important if you could just explain to teach them in person, rather than over a Zoom app?OCOL: I had done the remote learning for more than a year with the students, and Ive seen the limitations and the challenges that a teacher faces with remote learning. Its not really effective, its not as effective as doing in-person teaching.And I feel that its not also fair to the parents, or the parents need to be with the students when they should be earning a living. So, I think that the union should look at it not in a sweeping way.They did a sweeping manner on their demands, but there are schools without COVID. I have my classroom, I have 82 students, and Im not aware of anyone having COVID.Im not also aware of a teacher having COVID in my school. So, I think its a measure of the administration coming up with ways to really ensure safety measures being observed.So I think the union has to look at it on a school to school basis, it should not be in a sweeping way because thats not fair to the students. That is not fair to the parents.CARLSON: Amazing. Im so glad that you came on tonight. Thank you very much.OCOL: Youre welcome.CARLSON: Did you hear what that man said? He is going in to teach in the middle of a COVID outbreak despite the fact he has cancer because he wants to help people, because he wants to be relevant. Thats the point of life.The point of life is not to be safe or to prevent yourself from dying. The point is to do something; as he put it, to be relevant. Meaning matters. Amazing.Thats it for us tonight.

Drew Angerer/Pool via APPointing again to Trump, Biden said he \"created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.\" \"He has done so because he values power over principle; he sees his own interest as more important than America\u2019s interest; his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,\" Biden said.

Pointing to members of the Republican Party who are loyal to Trump, Biden said \"they seem to no longer want to be the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan or the Bushes.\" Biden claimed that some Republicans are working with Trump to continue to tell \"the Big Lie, and claimed that they \"fear his wrath.\" \"The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Nov. 3, 2020,\" Biden said. \"They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection.\"  \n     next\n     Image 1 of 2 A large group of police arrive at the Capitol, Thursday, Jan. 6, 2022, in Washington.

I cannot.\" \"At this moment, we must decide what kind of nation are we going to be?\" Biden declared. \"Will we be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?\"\"We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation,\" Biden is expected to say. In an effort to look ahead, Biden is expected to say that \"The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.\"Biden went on to slam new election laws in Republican-led states across the nation \u2013 but did not name the states to which he was referring. \"The only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,\" Biden said. \"It is wrong. It is undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.\" Again defending the results of the 2020 presidential election, Biden said that \"no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized.\" \"Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country was made and was rejected,\" Biden said, noting that, often times, Republican-appointed judges rejected the challenges. Biden went on to claim that \"even before the first ballot was cast,\" Trump \"was preemptively sowing lies about the vote,\" saying they were not \"based on facts,\" but instead was Trump\u2019s effort to look \"for a pre-text to cover for the truth.\" \"He is not just a former president. He is a defeated president,\" Biden said. \"You can\u2019t love your country only when you win. You can\u2019t obey the law only when it is convenient. You can\u2019t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies,\" Biden said. \"Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy.\"  A year after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, television cameras and video monitors fill Statuary Hall in preparation for news coverage, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 5, 2022.

Not in service of America, but rather, in service of one man,\" Biden said. \"Those who incited the mob, the real plotters who were desperate to deny the certification of this election, defied the will of the voters. But their plot was foiled.\" He added: \"Congress finished the work, honored their oath to defend the Constitution, against all enemies \u2013 foreign and domestic.\" Looking ahead, Biden said the United States is \"at an inflection point in history both at home and abroad,\" warning that America is \"engaged in a new struggle between democracy and autocracy.\" The president said that \"from China, Russia and beyond, they are betting that democracy\u2019s days are numbered\" and that America \"will become more like them and less like us.\" \"They are betting that America is the place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman,\" Biden said. \"I do not believe that. That is not who we are, that is not who we have ever been, and that is not who we will ever, ever be.\" The president said he is \"crystal clear\" about the \"threats\" America faces, urging Americans to \"step up\" and \"write the next chapter in American history where Jan. 6 marked not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.\" \"I believe the power of the presidency and purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it. To lift us up, not tear us apart,\" Biden said at the close of his remarks.\"To make it about us. Not about me.\" Biden urged Americans to \"remember together that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, and that today and tomorrow and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.\" Days after the riot in January 2021, the House of Representatives introduced an Article of Impeachment against Trump saying he \"engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\" The article alleged that before Jan. 6, the joint session of Congress to certify the presidential election results, Trump \"repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.\"The article claimed that before the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, the president addressed a crowd and reiterated \"false claims,\" claiming that his remarks \"encouraged--and forseeably resulted in--lawless action at the Capitol.\" The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13, 2021, to impeach Trump. The Senate, in February 2021, voted in favor of his acquittal.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTrump was the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, and the first president out of office to go through an impeachment proceeding. Meanwhile, in a statement shortly after Biden concluded his remarks Thursday, Trump slammed Biden saying he is \"working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal surrender, the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more.\" \"Everything he touches turns to failure,\" Trump said, repeating his unproven claims that the election was \"rigged.\"  Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines for January 8 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.They damn near lost the building.It\u2019s an overwrought metaphor. You\u2019ve heard it before. The Capitol Dome, piercing the Washington, D.C., skyline, is a symbol of democracy. A beacon of freedom throughout the world. The U.S. Capitol is that. But it\u2019s also an office building. A museum. An art gallery. And, the U.S. Capitol is the temple where American history plays out.It all unfolds under the Capitol Dome. Machinations in the building are synthesized with what the rest of the country is going through at any given moment.Debates and legislation about slavery. The first \"shot\" fired in the Civil War came in the Old Senate chamber as Rep. Preston Brooks, D-S.C., nearly beat to death Sen. Charles Sumner, R-Mass., with a cane. The building has seen imbroglios over ObamaCare. Arguments about firearms. The Dred Scott and Amistad decisions unfolded in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. Votes to send men and women to war are cast in the U.S. Capitol. We inaugurate American presidents on the West Front the U.S. Capitol. And they later lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. CAPITOL RIOTS: RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONDEMN VIOLENCE, URGE PEACE EVEN IN POLITICAL DISGREEMENTThe House and Senate chambers are no different than Walmart when it comes to donnybrooks about wearing masks during a pandemic. The House and Senate argued about civil rights during the 1960s. Contemporary debates about \"Black Lives Matter\" and police reform resonated in the chamber after police killings last spring and summer. And then the body of the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., lay in state within the Capitol walls. As such, one of the most malevolent, toxic moments in American history unfolded at the Capitol. It\u2019s forever stamped as a shameful date: Jan. 6, 2021. Marauders roamed the Capitol. Trashed the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s Office. Wielded Confederate flags in the Ohio Clock Corridor outside the Senate chamber. Ripped down the nameplate to the entrance of the office suite of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Vandalized a statue of President Zachary Taylor. Carved \"Murder the Media\" in a Capitol doorway. Extremists defecated in the hallways, stomped in their own feces and tracked their excrement across the encaustic, Minton tiles. A protester carries the lectern of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi through the Roturnda of the U.S. Capitol Building after a pro-Trump mob stormed the building on Jan. 6, 2021 in Washington.\r\n\u200b\u200b\u200bGetty Images Jan. 6, 2021, would have been historic enough on its own.The 12th Amendment to the Constitution dictates that the House and Senate huddle in a joint session of Congress to tally the Electoral College votes. The House and Senate convene in a joint session different from a joint meeting only for a presidents annual State of the Union address and to certify the electoral votes. So, while this quadrennial session is often a sleeper and rote in nature, it is an important event proscribed by an entire constitutional amendment. And, the 12th Amendment dictates that the vice president preside over the session. Past incursionPuerto Rican nationalists shot up the House chamber in 1954, wounding five Congress members. The \"fourth\" plane that hijackers commandeered and crashed in Pennsylvania was headed to the Capitol on 9/11. But the U.S. Capitol hadn\u2019t faced an incursion like the one it encountered Wednesday since the British stormed the building 207 years ago.The British routed American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg on Aug. 24, 1814, as a part of the \"Chesapeake Campaign.\" Having quashed the fledgling U.S. military in Maryland just outside Washington, the Royal Marines marched 10 miles to the east. They sacked the Capitol and set the structure ablaze.The inferno marked the only time since the Revolutionary War that the Capitol fell to a foreign raider.A foreign adversary didn\u2019t invade the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But this date is now entered into the almanac of ignominy. A macabre shorthand which speaks in shorthand: Sept.11, 2001 and Dec. 7, 1941. A foreign adversary didn\u2019t invade the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But this date is now entered into the almanac of ignominy. But this time, the threat didn\u2019t come from external foes. Senate Chaplain Barry Black addressed this menace in his closing prayer when the joint session of Congress finalized the Electoral College outcome just before 4 a.m. ET on Jan. 7.\"Protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies \u2013 domestic \u2013 as well as foreign,\" prayed Black, flipping the clich\u00e9 for emphasis. And they damn near lost the building.This isn\u2019t about a \"building.\" This is about American democracy. And if they \"lost the building\" Wednesday, the United States of America would have lost much more.Capitol security failed. But would the institutions of American democracy falter as well? Authorities are now rounding up some of the hoodlums and arresting them. When they came to the Capitol, one was in possession of explosives. Another toted Molotov cocktails. Another wielded an M4 carbine. Some had multiple handguns. Another thug brought \"homemade napalm.\"The continuity of American government teetered on a narrow ledge Wednesday. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much for democracy to plunge into a crevasse of catastrophe.The continuity of American government teetered on a narrow ledge Wednesday. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much for democracy to plunge into a crevasse of catastrophe. As I say, American history plays out under the Capitol Dome. All of this, as lawmakers convened a joint session of Congress with the speaker of the House and vice president of the United States presiding. \"They could have killed us all,\" fumed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \"How could they U.S. Capitol Police have failed so miserably, 20 years after 9/11? They could have blown the building up.\"We came damn close to losing it all on Jan. 6. Yogis wisdom\"You can see a lot by watching,\" proffered baseball legend Yogi Berra. The late Hall of Famers rhetorical tautology represents one of the important tools in a reporter\u2019s repertoire.Over the years, I\u2019ve learned to \"watch\" things on Capitol Hill. Observing, so as to divine meaning and decode various happenings.I frequently watch the floor directors for the speaker and majority leader in the House chamber. The floor director serves as a parliamentary sentinel for trouble. If the floor director is worked up, it\u2019s a good bet something bad is going down. An amendment may be about to fail. A member voted differently than was expected. There\u2019s an unanticipated problem with a bill. They may lack the votes to pass legislation. In this Jan. 6, 2021, file photo, protesters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington. Associated Press In the House, I train my eyes on Keith Stern, Pelosi\u2019s floor director.I was downstairs in the Capitol Visitor\u2019s Center in an auxiliary studio Fox News uses during the pandemic to cover the Electoral College certification. One of my earpieces was jacked into Fox\u2019s New York City and Washington studios. The other earpiece was wired so I could listen to either the House or Senate floors. We set up two monitors so I could observe happenings in both the House and Senate chambers.Not long after 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, I reported that there was a security threat inside the Capitol. I saw Stern running on my monitor as the House attempted to debate Arizona\u2019s slate of electoral votes. Stern\u2019s panic spelled a problem. A couple of moments later, the House abruptly recessed. But I could still hear the House floor audio in my earpiece. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., presided over the session. Years ago, congressional security officials told me of a battle plan during a hypothetical terrorist threat during State of the Union. They would likely cut the TV feed so officials could instruct those in the chamber on what to do. Seconds later, McGovern warned lawmakers and aides to get down under their desks. The Massachusetts Democrat instructed them to grab escape hoods stowed under chairs in the chamber. Gunfire in the CapitolI couldn\u2019t hear the pandemonium from the House chamber unfolding three floors above me. But it wasn\u2019t long until I was told by multiple sources there was gunfire in the Capitol. I used caution. Misinformation is a lava flow during a crisis. Hot. Fast. And dangerous. I finally confirmed that there was gunfire in the Capitol. But I wouldn\u2019t see video of what transpired until a few hours later.Misinformation is a lava flow during a crisis. Hot. Fast. And dangerous. A clutch of demonstrators raised hell at the glass doors atop a staircase leading to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby. The Speaker\u2019s Lobby is a long, ornate hallway stretching immediately behind the House chamber. The thugs kicked at the doors to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, stabbing at it with the butt end of poles festooned with Trump flags. They shouted \"Break it down!\" and \"F--- the police!\" The hooligans were getting close. If the mob broke into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, they were all but inside the House chamber.A secondary door leading to the chamber is immediately inside the Lobby. Security officials shoved stacks of furniture against the doors to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby to prevent the invaders from breaking inside. Then, a plainclothes U.S Capitol Police officer appeared inside the doorway to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby, service weapon drawn. A woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt of California then allegedly tried to scale the doorway and vault over the transom of the Speaker\u2019s Lobby.  Ashli Babbitt has been identified as the woman shot dead inside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. FOX 5, Washington Holding his weapon steady, the officer fired a single shot.It killed Babbitt. In normal, pre-pandemic times, I spend hours in the Speaker\u2019s Lobby. It\u2019s where most reporters go to talk to lawmakers and aides when votes are called in the House. The Speaker\u2019s Lobby hasn\u2019t been open since March due to the pandemic. But the video from Wednesday shows the mutineers were close to busting down the doors before the officer discharged his weapon. Hallowed venue alteredI will return to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby through those very doors when coronavirus subsides. But this grotesque episode forever alters that hallowed venue in America\u2019s seat of government. American history plays out under the Capitol Dome. An icon to that history is situated above the main entrance to Statuary Hall, the old House chamber.

A U.S. Capitol Police officer has been indicted on obstruction of justice charges after prosecutors say he helped to hide evidence of a rioters involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection.The officer, Michael A. Riley, is accused of tipping off someone who participated in the riot by telling them to remove posts from Facebook that had showed the person inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, according to court documents.He is due to appear in federal court in Washington later Friday. FILE - In this Jan. 6, 2021, file photo insurrections loyal to President Donald Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. A federal judge held the director of the District of Columbia\u2019s Department of Corrections and the warden of the city\u2019s jail in contempt of court on Wednesday, Oct. 13, and asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the civil rights of inmates are being abused. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had hauled the jail officials into court as part of the criminal case into Christopher Worrell, a member of the Proud Boys who has been charged in the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File Riley, who responded to a report of a pipe bomb on Jan. 6 and has been a Capitol Police officer for about 25 years, had sent the person a message telling them that he was an officer with the police force who \"agrees with your political stance,\" an indictment against him says.The indictment spells out how Riley sent dozens of messages to the unidentified person, encouraging them to remove incriminating photos and videos and telling them how the FBI was investigating to identify rioters.DYLANN ROOFS REQUEST TO RECONSIDER RECUSAL IS DENIEDIt wasnt clear if he had an attorney who could comment on the charges against him. A call to the U.S. Capitol Police wasnt immediately returned.His arrest and the accusation that an active duty Capitol Police officer was trying to obstruct the investigation into the attack is particularly notable because many of his colleagues were brutally beaten in the insurrection. The riot left dozens of police officers bloodied and bruised as the crowd of pro-Trump rioters, some armed with pipes, bats and bear spray, charged into the Capitol, quickly overrunning the overwhelmed police force. In this Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington. Right-wing extremism has previously mostly played out in isolated pockets of America or in smaller cities. In contrast, the deadly attack by rioters on the U.S. Capitol targeted the very heart of government. It brought together members of disparate groups, creating the opportunity for extremists to establish links with each other. AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File One officer was beaten and shocked with a stun gun repeatedly until he had a heart attack; another was foaming at the mouth and screaming for help as rioters crushed him between two doors and bashed him in the head with his own weapon.More than 600 people face charges in the Jan. 6 attack, in which a mob loyal to then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, battled police and tried to stop the certification of the election victory for President Joe Biden.CHICAGO FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE UNION; LIGHTFOOT DENOUNCES \u2018RHETORIC OF CONSPIRACY THEORISTS\u2019In the days after the attack, scores of rioters flaunted their participation in social media posts that bragged about their ability to get inside the Capitol. But then many started realizing it could be used as evidence and began deleting it.An Associated Press review of court records has found that at least 49 defendants are accused of trying to erase incriminating photos, videos and texts from phones or social media accounts documenting their conduct as the pro-Trump mob stormed Congress and briefly interrupted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. In this Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, supporters of President Donald Trump climb the west wall of the the U.S. Capitol in Washington. In what could be the longest of legal longshots, several of those arrested for storming the U.S. Capitol are holding out hope that President Donald Trump will use some of his last hours in office to grant all the rioters a full and complete pardon. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana Experts say the efforts to scrub the social media accounts reveal a desperate willingness to manipulate evidence once these people realized they were in hot water. They say it can serve as powerful proof of people\u2019s consciousness of guilt and can make it harder to negotiate plea deals and seek leniency at sentencing.Riley told the rioter that the scene was a \"total s---show.\" \"I\u2019m glad you got out of there unscathed. We had over 50 officers hurt, some pretty bad,\" the officer wrote, according to the complaint.BRITISH CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN SIR DAVID AMESS DEAD AFTER BEING STABBED WHILE MEETING CONSTITUENTSWhen the rioter said through messaging that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d done anything wrong, Riley responded, according to court papers: \"The only thing I can see is if you went into the building and they have proof you will be charged. You could always articulate that you had nowhere to go, but that\u2019s for court.\"Later in January, after two had discussed their love of fishing, Riley told the man to get off social media. National guards are seen Wednesday, Jan. 13, 2021, on a fence that was erected to reinforce security at the Capitol in Washington. AP Photo/Shafkat Anowar\"They\u2019re arresting dozens of people a day,\" he wrote, according to the posting. \"Everyone that was in the building. Engaged in violent acts or destruction of property and they\u2019re all being charged federally with felonies.\"Making digital content vanish isn\u2019t as easy as deleting content from phones, removing social media posts or shutting down accounts. Investigators have been able to retrieve the digital content by requesting it from social media companies, even after accounts are shut down. Posts made on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms are recoverable for a certain period of time, and authorities routinely ask those companies to preserve the records until they get court orders to view the posts.KIM POTTER DEFENSE STRATEGY IN DAUNTE WRIGHT CASE REVEALED IN COURT DOCUMENTSDespite initial criticism that Capitol police did not do enough to stop the rioters, Riley is the first Capitol police officer to be charged with a crime involving the insurrection.But several current and former police officers were arrested on riot-related charges, including two Virginia police officers who posed for a photo during the attack. In July, authorities arrested an off-duty Drug Enforcement Administration agent accused of posing for photographs in which he flashed his DEA badge and firearm outside the Capitol during the riot.Other law enforcement officers were investigated for their presence at the Capitol that day or at Trump\u2019s rally before the riot. In January, an Associated Press survey of law enforcement agencies nationwide found that at least 31 officers in 12 states are being scrutinized by their supervisors for their behavior in the District of Columbia or face criminal charges for participating in the riot.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPIn September, Capitol Police said officials had recommended disciplinary action in six cases after an internal review of officer behavior stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility had opened 38 internal investigations and was able to identify 26 of the officers involved, police said in a statement at the time. In 20 of the cases, no wrongdoing was found.It isnt clear whether Riley was among the officers who were referred for disciplinary action."

  "text": "Tucker Carlson: Lies about Jan. 6 have enabled unscrupulous people to steal our freedoms Fox News host Tucker Carlson reflects on the January 6 Capitol breach two years later on Tucker Carlson Tonight. Two years ago today, a Capitol Hill police officer called Michael Byrd shot an unarmed woman in the neck. At the time of that killing, Byrd had a documented history of gross negligence with a firearm. He left a loaded Glock pistol in a public mens room at the Capitol, which for a law enforcement official is a firing offense. But for some reason, Michael Byrd was still on the force that day. The woman he killed was called Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was a married 14-year veteran of the U.S. military. She ran a pool cleaning company with her husband in San Diego. Physically, she was tiny. She was also unarmed. Michael Byrd later admitted he had no indication at all that Babbitt was carrying a weapon. She posed no visible threat. He killed her anyway. Under normal circumstances, Byrd would have been fired immediately and charged with murder, which he clearly committed, but thats not what happened. After doing essentially no investigation into the shooting, Nancy Pelosis congressional police force declared Byrd a national hero and the media strongly agreed. Byrd went on television to accept accolades and to complain about racism. He was never punished for killing Ashli Babbitt. He was rewarded for it. Ashli Babbitt s mother, meanwhile, got a very different sort of treatment. Babbitts mother was arrested today in Washington by the Capitol Police. Her crime? Trying to hold a memorial service for her daughter. JAN. 6 COMMITTEE RELEASES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OF TRUMP OFFICIALS AND ALLIES: REPORT Two years later, its clear that Ashli Babbitt is \u2013 her death \u2013 is by far the most significant thing that happened at the US Capitol building that day, but at the same time, it is the least talked about event of January 6. Why is that? Well, because the facts about what actually happened on January 6 disrupt the lies, what they told you happened on January 6, and those lies have proven very useful to the Biden administration and to permanent Washington. VideoOn the basis of a wholly created myth about what happened that day, the Biden Pentagon conducted an unprecedented political purge of the entire U.S. military. The FBI and various intel agencies increased their control over the American media and most obviously, the DOJ has been allowed to prosecute and jail hundreds of nonviolent political protesters whose crime was having the wrong opinions. Lies about January 6, which have been relentless, have enabled some of the most unscrupulous people in our country to make a mockery of our Bill of Rights and to steal our core freedoms. VideoSo they cant talk about Ashli Babbitt. Talking about Ashli Babbitt makes it very clear who the real culprits are and who the real threats to this country continue to be and theyre not the January 6 protesters. So instead, they lie about what happened that day and they do it in the boldest possible ways, without shame and with maximum aggression. Heres Hakeem Jeffries, leader of the Democrats in the House, telling you that five police officers were killed on January 6, when in fact, the real total is zero. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We are gathered here to honor their memory and acknowledge with deep gratitude the tremendous bravery of the hundreds of officers who defended us at this citadel of democracy that fateful day. As a result of the events on January 6, the lives of five heroic officers were lost. Five heroic officers were lost, he said. Its almost impossible to believe that adults could stand behind him as he said that because everyone in the picture you just saw knows that is not true. Its not a stilted interpretation of events. Its a flat out lie. No police officers were killed on January 6. Period. Ashli Babbitt was killed on January 6, but chances are our grandchildren will not know that because history will likely record the lie you just heard as true simply because its been repeated so often. Everyone in authority has said the same thing in unison for two solid years. As our thoroughly dishonest Attorney General recently put it \"we will never forget the five officers who responded selflessly on January 6 and who have since lost their lives.\" His boss, Joe Biden, repeated that lie today from the White House. HOUSE JAN 6 COMMITTEE RELEASES FINAL 814-PAGE REPORT, RECOMMENDS DONALD TRUMP BE BARRED FROM RUNNING IN 2024  U.S. President Joe Biden walks to speak to reporters as he and first lady Jill Biden leave the White House and walk to Marine One on the South Lawn on December 27, 2022 in Washington, DC. Anna MoneymakerPRESIDENT BIDEN: These people and the people representing those who couldnt be here because they gave their lives for this did, is incredibly consequential. Thats not political talk. Thats historical fact. \"Thats historical fact,\" says Joe Biden as he manufactures history, as he tells lies. Theyve been doing this, telling these same lies since the very first day, January 6, 2021, almost like it was a coordinated operation. Remember when they told you that Brian Sicknick, Officer Brian Sicknick, was beaten to death with a fire extinguisher? FREDERICKA WHITFIELD, CNN: Officer Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. CNN REPORTER : Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. ANA CABRERA, CNN: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the hours long attack. NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC: They beat a Capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight. CRAIG MELVIN, MSNBC: He died at the age of 42 after he was bludgeoned the fire extinguisher. DONALD TRUMP SUED BY GIRLFRIEND OF FALLEN CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER BRIAN SICKNICK Thats not true and in the end, thanks to the medical examiner in the District of Columbia, we learned the fact, which is that Brian Sicknick died of a stroke well after the January 6 protests. He was not beaten to death with a fire extinguisher, but that did not stop their lying or even slow them down. Joe Biden just awarded one of this countrys highest civilian honors, the Presidential Citizens Medal, to officers working on January 6 and that would include the officers who opened the doors of the Capitol building to the so-called insurrectionists, the officers who let them inside and then were rewarded for it by the president of the United States. \"Whats going on here? \" You may wonder. Well, dont ask. Youre not allowed to know whats going on here, nor can you know about the very obvious clandestine role of federal agencies that encouraged the events of January 6. That happened, but its details have never been explained. A lot has still not been explained from that day, despite a committee that was impaneled for more than a year. For example, you remember the pipe bomber who planted explosives outside the Democratic National Committee? Well, those explosives, it turns out, were under a bench at the same moment that Kamala Harris, who had Secret Service protection with her, who swept the building, was there. So, how did the U.S. Secret Service miss a bomb sitting in plain sight during its security sweep? Well, we cant answer that because the FBI still to this day refuses to release all the security footage. Why? Whats going on here? Almost unique among media outlets, Revolver News asked that question. REVOLVER NEWS: The pipe bomber even looks at camera to head on for some reason. Its very frustrating because we cant see the moment the pipe bomber plants the pipe bomb, but the FBI can. Thats because the whole scene should be captured on camera one as well and much more clearly than camera two. Camera one has a clear shot of both benches. If the FBI released the full tape from camera one, we could see the pipe bomber planting the bomb. MOTHER OF CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER BRIAN SICKNICK BLAMES PEOPLE LIKE KARI LAKE FOR HIS DEATH VideoSo, somebody planted bombs outside the headquarters of this countrys two main political parties. That would seem to be a big story, and yet no one ever mentions it again, including the FBI. In fact, the Bureau wont disclose any information about the suspect, not his height, weight, shoe size, anything. So, if they wanted to catch this person, wouldnt they be telling you all they can about who it is? But theyre not. Why arent they and what was Kamala Harris doing there? Why did she lie about being there? We can\u2019t answer those questions. We should be able to. Nor does anyone in authority want to talk about Ray Epps. Ray Epps, is of course, is the man who was caught on tape encouraging the crowd outside the Capitol, both on January 5 and 6, to commit felonies by rushing inside. Now, whats interesting is that the January 6 Committee, under public pressure, did in the end interview Ray Epps. Now, we dont have all of the committees records about that interview. We should, but we dont. But some have been released and what they tell is a remarkable story. VideoIn the testimony that we have, the committee coaches Ray Epps on how to answer questions about his involvement. \"I was in the front with a few others. I also orchestrated it. I helped get people there.\" Now, Epps admitted that in a text message to a relative on January 6. Hes admitting crimes. Hes never been even charged for those crimes. But whats so fascinating is that when those facts came up in his interview with the committee, someone on the committee responds this way, and were quoting: \"I just want to understand a little more your use of the word orchestrated. It sounds to me like at this point, when you sent this text, you had turned away in part because of seeing some things that you didnt agree with. Is that right? Like when you sent this, you were already on your way from the capital because of concerns of people taking it in a different direction. \" Is that the most leading question ever asked in the history of a congressional hearing? Probably. And the whole interview goes on like this. Keep in mind, Ray Epps is one of the only people caught on camera that day encouraging others to break the law. Hes one of the only ones and yet hes never been charged and the January 6 Committee was on his side. Why was the committee and its members working so hard to help Ray Epps? Now, in his interview with the committee, Ray Epps said he didnt work for law enforcement Law enforcement \u2013 in a very specifically worded answer, clearly thought through ahead of time. The question is, did Ray Epps work or have any contact with any government agency? Did he talk about January 6 before it happened with any employee of the U.S. government? We dont know. We do know that two years after January 6, long after an awful lot of other people have gone to jail for walking around the Capitol building, Ray Epps is still a free man. Hes never been charged, much less imprisoned in solitary confinement like so many others. Why is that? Well, lets just stop lying. At this point, its pretty obvious why that is. But of course, theyre still lying about it. "

  "text": "Procession for fallen U.S. Capitol Officer William Evans A Pennsylvania man charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was severely beaten by Washington D.C. jail guards at a corrections center, according to defense attorneys and another defendant held at the facility who referenced the attack in court Tuesday. During a court appearance via Zoom on Tuesday, an inmate named Ronald Sandlin told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich that guards at the Correctional Treatment Facility in Washington, D.C., were allegedly subjecting those held in connection to the Jan. 6 attack to violence, threats and verbal harassment. Sandlin described an attack that allegedly happened last month to another defendant charged in the Jan. 6 event, Ryan Samsel, while held at the facility operated by the D.C. Department of Corrections. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER WHO SURVIVED FATAL CAR-RAMMING ATTACK RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL AS MOTIVE REMAINS UNCLEAR He told the judge that Samsel, \"was severely beaten by correctional officers, [is now] blind in one eye, has a skull fracture and detached retina,\" Politico reported. Richard Barnett, also charged in connection to the riot, was tackled \"to the ground\" by guards, Sandlin said.Attorneys representing Samsel, Steven Metcalf and Elisabeth Pasqualini, did not return voicemails left by Fox News on Wednesday. Speaking with the Washington Post, Metcalf detailed how his client told him about an incident that happened on March 20 when Samsel said he complained that the guards took hours to bring him toilet paper and an argument ensued.According to Metcalf, Samsel was moved to another cell that evening and by midnight two guards arrived, tied his arms behind his back with zip-tie handcuffs and \"beat him to a bloody pulp.\" The lawyer said his client has since suffered seizures for the first time in his life. The attack allegedly left him with a broken nose, dislocated jaw and damaged vision in one eye.When he saw his client for the first time over video two weeks after the incident, Metcalf said Samsel\u2019s face was still black and blue and the skin around his wrists stripped off.\"I have seen Ryan. He has two black eyes to this day, two weeks later. All the skin is ripped off both wrists, which shows the zip ties and how tight they were,\" Metcalf said in a separate interview with Politico. \"Other inmates said his face looked like a tomato that was stomped on.\"\"We intend on filing a lawsuit against the two specific guards and the facility responsible for this scenario because Ryan Samsel did not deserve to get targeted and treated like this,\" Metcalf added.Pasqualini told Politico that Samsel had been moved to an \"undisclosed location\" early Tuesday and the incident when he was allegedly attacked by DC guards is under investigation by the FBI. The attorney said she learned about the incident from lawyers representing other defendants held at the jail. The D.C. Department of Corrections said in a statement that the facility \"takes the safety and well-being of all residents, staff, and contractors extremely seriously. We are aware of the allegation made by an inmate and it is under investigation by the Department of Justice.\"During the hearing Tuesday, the judge made no direct response to the allegations made by Sandlin regarding Samsel and Barnett. But Friedrich did schedule another hearing for Thursday to discuss Sandlin\u2019s potential pre-trial release.Prosecutors on Tuesday objected to Sandlin\u2019s pre-trial release and told the court he had been in contact with \"famed documentarian\" Dinesh DSouza.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"It would not surprise me at all if he absconded and tried to paint himself as the Edward Snowden of the Capitol riot,\" a prosecutor reportedly said in court.Sandlin also reportedly described what he categorized as racial tension between minority guards and the largely White suspects held at the jail, given that some suspects have been accused of belonging to White supremacist groups. Sandlin told the judge one guard declared, \"I hate all White people and your honky religion,\" according to Politico.Samsel is charged with assaulting a U.S. Capitol Police officer and engaging in disorderly conduct. According to court documents, he allegedly pushed a barricade to the ground outside the building, knocking over an officer, causing her to hit her head on the stairs behind her and lose consciousness.Samsel allegedly picked the officer up, telling her, \"We don\u2019t have to hurt you, why are you standing in our way?\" The officer appeared semiconscious and left but collapsed later that day while arresting a different rioter, court documents allege.

  "text": "Does Biden want Trump aides jailed? MediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz discusses President Bidens stance on DOJ prosecutions of former Trump officialsIn cold-hearted political terms, the Jan. 6th riot seemed like a loser.The storming of the Capitol, the attacks on police officers, the violent chants against the vice president, the sordid spectacle of an assault on democracy\u2014all this left a deep scar on the country. The mob failed spectacularly in its attempt to overturn an election, to block the certification of Joe Biden as president. And Donald Trump, who summoned his supporters to Washington and sent them up Pennsylvania Avenue with a fiery speech, was harshly criticized by some leaders of his own party.That was then.Now, for many Republicans, the situation has been turned on its head. It\u2019s not just that people\u2019s memories have faded or the country has moved on. Somehow, in some quarters, the riot is now being portrayed as a plus.The legal maneuvering is front and center. Trump has just sued Congress and the National Archives to block the release of any documents related to Jan. 6 on grounds of executive privilege. Trump argues this is a political ploy by Biden, who has refused to invoke executive privilege, and his \"partisan allies.\" The committee argues this is obstructionism and that nothing could be more important than investigating an attack on American democracy. FILE - In this Jan. 6, 2021, file photo insurrections loyal to President Donald Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington.

The Atlantic calls the pro-Trump crusade \"The New Lost Cause.\"MEGHAN MCCAIN BLAMES HOSTILE \u2018VIEW\u2019 COLLEAGUES FOR HER EXIT IN EMOTIONAL MEMOIRAnd Politico says that Democratic attacks on GOP lawmakers who were either there or supported challenging the Electoral College results actually wound up helping the Republicans.Trump, obviously, has been leading the effort at revisionist history battle. So it\u2019s easy to ascribe the current stance of many Republican politicians as just not wanting the cross the party\u2019s de facto leader and possible 2024 nominee. But what\u2019s happening is deeper than that, underlining the two clashing realities that dominate American politics today.The belief that Jan. 6 was a righteous cause that somehow went awry requires an equally strong belief that the 2020 election was in fact stolen from Trump\u2014as he argues virtually every day, despite the investigations and lawsuits to the contrary. More than half the country, and the vast majority of the media, see that as ridiculous, but polls indicate that for many Republicans it has become an article of faith.The Atlantic likens Trump\u2019s crusade to the Confederacy, which of course mounted an armed rebellion against the United States largely to uphold the evils of slavery. And yet the politicians and generals who led that effort in secession have been venerated in the South for generations\u2014until recent years, when the tide shifted and the statues started to come down. \"The New Lost Cause, like the old one, seeks to convert a shameful catastrophe into a celebration of the valor and honor of the culprits and portray those who attacked the country as the true patriots,\" the piece says. \"But lost causes have a pernicious tendency to be less lost than we might hope. Just as neo-Confederate revisionism shaped racial violence and oppression after the war, Trump\u2019s New Lost Cause poses a continuing peril to the hope of \u2018one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u2019\"Author David Graham allows that it was awful for Ashli Babbitt to have been fatally shot by a police officer as she tried to break into the House chamber.

AP Photo/Patrick Semansky But while lost causes may have their martyrs, says the magazine, ticking off historical examples, the problem is that \"they emphasize the valor of the people involved while whitewashing what they were doing.\" The soldiers of the Confederacy \"might well have been brave, and they might well have been good fathers, brothers, and sons, but they died in service of a treasonous war to preserve the institution of slavery, and that is why their actions do not deserve celebration. The January 6 insurrection was an attempt to subvert the Constitution and steal an election.\"Politico examines the situation more at the ground-game level. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIES MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAYS HOTTEST STORIESWeeks after the riot, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ran digital ads in three states with this narration of the images of destruction: \"Republican legislators fanned the flames. Some were even there.\"Not much happened. In fact, the ads backfired when they targeted a Pennsylvania Republican state senator named Doug Mastriano, who was tagged by a colleague in a Facebook photo as being at the Capitol on that tragic day.\"His street cred went up,\" the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader admitted. \"There\u2019s no question.\"The DLCC went after 21 lawmakers who were either at the Trump rally or with the Capitol protesters, and 600 others who signed letters or otherwise promoted \"Stop the Steal\" rhetoric. But the Democratic group misread the mood of the GOP:CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"Rather than shaming Republican state lawmakers out of office, Democrats found that many of the names on the list avoided pushback from party leaders in their state, grew their political platform and online following, and in at least three cases are now running for statewide office.\"Even with Trump having told his supporters in the midst of the violence \"go home, we love you,\" some have tried to justify what happened that day. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, among others, castigated Trump for his role in fomenting the riot, but have since quieted their criticism. History, it is said, is written by the winners. But in this case, those who lost the campaign to overturn the election, and have minimized Jan. 6, have convinced a whole lot of Americans of their version.

The sentence for Guy Reffitt, a member of the Texas Three Percenters militia group, is the longest so far imposed among hundreds of Capitol riot cases.

Dana Verkouteren via AP, FileReffitt told fellow militia members he planned to drag House Speaker Nancy Pelosi out of the Capitol building by her ankles, \"with her head hitting every step on the way down,\" according to a court filing.Reffitt was the first person to go on trial for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, in which supporters of then-President Trump halted the joint session of Congress for certifying Joe Bidens 2020 electoral victory.DOJ ADMITS SPIKE IN DOMESTIC TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS MOSTLY RELATED TO JAN. 6 RIOTSHis prison sentence \u2014 seven years and three months \u2014 is two years more than the previous longest prison sentence for a Capitol riot defendant. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler had requested 15 years for Reffitt, calling him a domestic terrorist who wanted to physically remove and replace members of Congress.U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich rejected prosecutors contention that an \"upward departure for terrorism\" was warranted in Reffitts case. It was the first time that prosecutors have requested that sentencing enhancement for a Jan. 6 case.

T Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesFriedrich, however, questioned why Reffitt would merit the terrorism enhancement when many other rioters engaged in violence and made similarly disturbing threats.BILL MAHER: REPUBLICANS WOULD \u2018SECRETLY LOVE IT\u2019 IF TRUMP WERE IN JAIL OVER JAN. 6On Monday, Reffitt offered an expletive-laden apology to police officers, lawmakers and congressional staffers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Defense attorney Clinton Broden asked for Reffitt to be sentenced to no more than two years in prison. Broden noted that Reffitt didnt assault any law enforcement officers or enter the Capitol building.Videos captured the confrontation between outnumbered Capitol police officers and a mob of people, including Reffitt, who approached them on the west side of the Capitol.Reffitt was armed with a Smith & Wesson pistol in a holster on his waist, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing body armor and a helmet equipped with a video camera when he advanced on the officers, prosecutors said. He retreated after an officer pepper sprayed him in the face, but he waved on other rioters who ultimately breached the building, prosecutors said.

He drove to Washington, D.C., with Rocky Hardie, a fellow member of the Texas Three Percenters militia group.Hardie testified that both of them were armed with holstered handguns when they attended Trumps \"Stop the Steal\" rally before the riot. Hardie also said Reffitt gave him two pairs of zip-tie cuffs in case they needed to detain anybody.Reffitt is one of seven Capitol riot defendants to get a jury trial so far. Jurors have unanimously convicted all seven of them on all counts in their respective indictments.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMore than 840 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. Over 340 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. More than 220 have been sentenced, with nearly half of them receiving terms of imprisonment.

  "text": "Senate acquits Trump in impeachment trial University of Baltimore law professor Kimberly Wehle and former deputy dependent counsel Sol Wisenberg react on Americas News HQFormer President Trump was acquitted in an unprecedented second impeachment trial on the charge of inciting an insurrection for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, making him the first and only president to be impeached and acquitted twice in history.A majority of senators found Trump guilty on Saturday in a 57-43 vote, but the number fell 10 short of the supermajority needed to convict the president. Had Trump been convicted, the Senate would have moved to bar the 45th president from holding federal office ever again.The seven GOP senators who joined with all Democrats in finding Trump guilty were: Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who presided over the trial announced the vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed and therefore Trump is \"hereby acquitted of the charge.\"The acquittal means that as of now Trump can leave the door open to another White House bid in 2024, though senators have hinted they may still try to bar him from office in a separate 14th Amendment measure. SCHUMER LEAVES DOOR OPEN TO 14TH AMENDMENT MEASURE TO BAR TRUMP FROM OFFICETrump praised the victory, thanked his supporters and promised hed soon emerge with a \"vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future.\" The former president, who has largely stayed silent since his impeachment, also took aim at his opponents.TRUMP CELEBRATES ACQUITTAL IN SENATE TRIAL, FORESHADOWS POLITICAL FUTURE: MUCH TO SHARE\"This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,\" Trump said in a statement. \"No president has ever gone through anything like it, and it continues because our opponents cannot forget the almost 75 million people, the highest number ever for a sitting president, who voted for us just a few short months ago.\"Trumps second impeachment trial arguments lasted just five days, making it the shortest in presidential history. The previous record was held by Trump in 2020 when his trial related to inviting foreign interference into the election spanned 21 days. The trial surrounded the Jan. 6 riot when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, beat police officers, chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" and forced lawmakers to take shelter. The mayhem temporarily stopped Congress certification of President Bidens Electoral College win.  FILE - In this Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington. Right-wing extremism has previously mostly played out in isolated pockets of America or in smaller cities. In contrast, the deadly attack by rioters on the U.S. Capitol targeted the very heart of government. It brought together members of disparate groups, creating the opportunity for extremists to establish links with each other. AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File House impeachment managers accused Trump of inciting the insurrection by spreading a \"big lie\" the election was stolen from him, summoning his supporters to Washington on Jan. 6, telling them to \"fight like hell\" and then refusing to call off the attack once the mob violently took over the Capitol.\"He named the date. He named the time. He brought them here, and now he must pay the price,\" lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in his closing remarks to the Senate. Trump legals team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional \"sham impeachment\" against a private citizen, driven by Democrats \"hatred\" for Trump and desire to silence a political opponent. Trump lawyers also argued the former presidents political speech is protected by the First Amendment and his words on Jan. 6 to his supporters to \"fight like hell\" were not meant literally. To drive home that point during the trial, Trumps defense played an 11-minute video of nearly every Democrat in the chamber using the words \"fight\" in their past speeches and interviews. In this image from video, House impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., speaks during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 11, 2021. Senate Television via AP The vote capped a wild Saturday in Washington with numerous plot twists.In a curveball move, the Senate Saturday morning voted 55-45 to allow witnesses at the trial after Raskin said they wanted to hear from GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler.Raskin cited the \"breaking news\" overnight about details Beutler revealed of a heated phone call that Trump had with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy during the middle of the Capitol attack.Beutler, who was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in House, released her account of the call late Friday, confirming a CNN report that Trump dismissed McCarthys pleas to call off the riot and instead told McCarthy that the rioters were \"more upset about the election\" than the House leader.MCCONNELL WILL VOTE TO ACQUIT TRUMP IN SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, AS DAY FIVE GETS UNDERWAY\"When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the Capitol,\" Beutler said in her statement. \"McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. Thats when, according to McCarthy, the president said, Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\"Trumps legal team blasted the decision to call witnesses and threatened to depose 100 people if the door is open. A visibly angry and animated Michael van der Veen said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Kamala Harris would \"absolutely\" need to be deposed, too, but not by Zoom.\"These depositions should be done in person in my office in Philadelphia,\" van der Veen told the senators, which drew audible laughter from the Senate chamber. ANOTHER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TWIST: SENATE SIDESTEPS WITNESSES DESPITE VOTE ALLOWING THEMVan deer Veen shot back: \"I havent laughed at any of you. And theres nothing laughable here.\" Lawyer Michael T. van der Veen speaks during Trump impeachment trial on Friday, Feb. 12. The surprise vote on witnesses shook Washington and seemed to even catch senators off guard.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the move set off \"chaos\" in the chamber. He speculated the trial could last until April with witnesses.\"At this point, its pandemonium,\" Cruz told pool reporters.But just as quickly as the Senate went down the path of witnesses, lawyers then reversed course on Saturday. After a recess where lawyers huddled, Trumps legal team agreed to allow the damaging statement from Beutler to be entered into the trial as evidence. Armed with her statement, House prosecutors then abandoned their demand for witnesses altogether and moved to closing arguments. House managers said the revelations about McCarthys call with Trump show that Trump abdicated his oath of office by showing support for the rioters and disregard for the security of members of Congress and Pence, who was targeted by the mob for assassination.\"He chose retaining his own power over the safety of Americans,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. \"I cant imagine more damning evidence of his state of mind.\"The arguments, however, werent enough to sway the 17 GOP senators needed for conviction. MCCONNELL RIPS TRUMP, SAYS ACTIONS UNCONSCIONABLE BUT TRIAL WAS UNCONSTITUTIONALGOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was very critical of Trumps conduct surrounding the Jan. 6 riot and his wife -- former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- even resigned from the administration in the aftermath of the attack that left at least five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer. \"Theres no question... that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,\" McConnell said in a speech after the vote Saturday. Still, McConnell found Trump \"not guilty,\" saying he believes convicting the former president is unconstitutional. \"We have no power to convict and disqualify a former office holder who is now a private citizen,\" McConnell said in a speech.

Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, one of the impeachment managers, said McConnell all but admitted the House proved its case but resorted to a procedural excuse against conviction. \"Trump was let off on a technicality and thats essentially what you heard Mitch McConnell say,\" Castro said. PELOSI BLASTS MCCONNELL AND COWARDLY GROUP OF REPUBLICANS IN SENATE AFTER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ACQUITTALIn a news conference after the vote, Democratic managers pointed out that the presidential impeachment process was the most bipartisan in history, with 10 House Republicans and now seven GOP senators backing the effort.\"Even though we didnt get 67 votes, this has been the most bipartisan vote for impeachment and conviction ever,\" Castro said. \"And we know that we spoke the truth and the American people by and large have agreed with us.\"  Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

  "description": "Tucker Carlson asks why American leadership and the liberal media is obsessed with the January 6 riots, and why certain figures have yet to be investigated.",
  "text": "Tucker: Why are our leaders obsessing over this? \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 host examines the left\u2019s \u2018repulsive\u2019 rhetoric covering the events on Jan. 6 one year later. As you may have heard, this is the anniversary of January 6th, and in commemoration of that, we have donned the official network-approved solemn anchor outfit: white shirt, muted tie, message reverence. But actually, if you take three steps back as historical events go\u2014if we\u2019re being honest now\u2014January 6th, barely rates as a footnote, really, not a lot happened that day. If you think about it, the presidential election was not overturned, the Capitol was not destroyed. The government wasnt toppled. No matter what you may have heard, not a single elected official was injured, thank God. Police got shoved. Unfortunately, punches were thrown. But the only person who wound up dead from violence was an unarmed protester who was shot to death without warning by a cop. None of the so-called insurrectionists had guns. When was the last time you saw an insurrection like that?So looking back, you could probably call what happened on January 6th a riot, we have called it that, but really only just a riot, maybe just barely. By recent standards, it was an embarrassingly tepid effort. No one even bothered to set a fire or spray paint slogans on the walls. So the question is why are we still talking about this? Why are our leaders obsessing over this event? For every single one of the last 365 days, the propaganda machine has been at 11, ginning up noise about January 6 to deafening levels, and its not stopping. In fact, after all this time, amazingly, the yelling is getting louder and wilder and still more disconnected from reality. Why are they doing this? Well, its not for voters. Look at the polls. Voters are not very interested in hearing about this anymore, and you can see why.KAMALA HARRIS PRAISES REPUBLICAN LIZ CHENEYS \u2018COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH\u2019A year after the election it doesnt make sense. Its not relevant to their lives. Everyone agrees January 6 was ugly. But was it really a greater threat to America than, say, inflation? Than opening the southern border and admitting two million people whose identities we cant confirm? Yeah, they tell us January 6 was scary. Reporters were very afraid. But was it as scary as whats going on right now tonight in say, upscale shopping malls in Atlanta, where people are being shot to death in the parking lot? It was a crime, OK? Was it a greater crime in the manufactured drug epidemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, mostly young people, in the last year? Probably not. And yet protesters who walked through the Capitol that day are still in jail tonight a year later. The Sackler family, the group that destroyed rural America with OxyContin, got off with a fine. They\u2019re still billionaires and so on and so on. So its a tough sell, telling normal people that this is a world-historic event. So why are they still saying that? There are reasons actually and were going to do our best to explain what those reasons are and what actually happened? VideoBut first to todays reaction, we begin with Kamala Harris, though never a master of subtlety, you will not be surprised that in her speech today, she bypassed the subtlety. In fact, Harris compared the events of January 6th to Pearl Harbor and then to 911. Did she really say that? You ask? Oh, yes, she did. KAMALA HARRIS: Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them, where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault. // December 7th, 1941, September 11th, 2001 and January 6th, 2021. HARRIS DESCRIBES JAN. 6 ALONGSIDE PEARL HARBOR, 9/11 AS DATES THAT ECHO THROUGHOUT HISTORYYeah. January 6th, its one of those indelible moments, one of those moments you cant forget, like the birth of your first child, the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, youve got to ask yourself, where were you when CNN claimed for the very first time that our democracy was under assault? Chances are youre probably standing at an airport waiting to get on the plane and wishing to God someone would turn the sound down on the TV set bolted to the ceiling. Because its absurd, and so is what Harris said\u2014its ridiculous. In fact, its so ridiculous, were not even going to bother to deconstruct it once again or attempt to refute it. Its self-discrediting as if Kamala Harris could be further discredited. But not to be outdone in the Hyperbole Olympics, her boss slash subordinate pick one, Joe Biden, decided to up the historical stakes, assuming thats possible in a separate speech, which were not going to show tonight because it was awful and weird. Biden told the country that in fact, symbolically, January 6th was worse than the Civil War, the American Civil War. That would be the war that killed more than a million people. January 6th was worse than that because somebody held a naughty flag. Its so far beyond parody at this point, its hard to know how to assess it. Where did this come from? Obviously, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris dont write their own material. Neither one is capable of composing more than a bitchy text message with emojis. But some human beings sat down and typed those words and then read them on the screen. A speechwriter. And you wonder if that speechwriter felt shame as he did that. 9/11? Pearl Harbor? The Civil War? Your face will go red even thinking something like that. VideoBut these people have no shame. And that definitely goes to the national media, they were out in force today. So in case youre still wondering, after all these years if there is such a thing as a coordinated message campaign where someone gets on a call and says, heres what were saying today for political effect, in case thats even a question in your mind, we sat down with a pen today and counted as at least eight separate television anchors described January 6th as quote, \"One of the darkest days in our history.\" Exact same words. Now its not simply that they all love cliches because theyre dumb, though. Of course, thats true. Its the all said it together, as they always do, and this was on three separate TV networks that was there were more than three, but we finally felt sick and gave up watching. But it was MSNBC, as usual, that went all the way for the prize and grotesquery today. The Joy Reid network found a guy called Doug Brinkley\u2014hes one of those television historians whos never actually written significant history of anything\u2014to just come right out and compare January 6th to Auschwitz. You knew that was coming. Now, this is repulsive. But as historians, we feel duty-bound to show you what actually happened. Here is Doug Brinkley. DOUG BRINKLEY: Liz Cheney has become our true profiles in courage. // She reminds us of brave Republicans in the past, like Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Chase Smith, John McCain. But we have film footage of what happened on January 6th. We have proof. Dwight Eisenhower during World War Two made sure all the Holocaust camps were filmed. So weve got the film footage. // January 6th has to be a crusade. Thats every day. As the New York Times op-ed said, every day is January 6th. // So we are in a real neo-civil war, and its a battle between democracy versus a kind of nativist authoritarianism. JAN 6. ANNIVERSARY: MSNBC INVITES HISTORIAN TO INVOKE THE HOLOCAUST, BACKS COMPARISONS TO 9/11, PEARL HARBORWere in a kind of civil war. But more specifically, we await the ADLs furious statement condemning Doug Brinkley for trivializing genocide, which he just did. Well let you know when we get that statement. In the meantime, Doug Brinkley was right about one thing. There are an awful lot of images showing what happened inside the Capitol on January 6th. We dont have to guess for the most part. I want to show one of them tonight because its frankly representative. Heres the terrifying scene on the floor of the United States Senate as insurrectionists swept in.HORN RIOTER: Hey, F------\u2019 A, man, glad to see you guys, you guys are f------ patriots. Look at this guy, this guy is covered in blood, God bless you.OFFICER: You good, sir? You need medical attention?RIOTER 2: I\u2019m good, thank you, I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet.OFFICER: Any chance I can get you guys to leave the Senate wing? RIOTER 2: We will, I\u2019ve been making sure they ain\u2019t disrespecting the place.OFFICER: O.K., I just want to let you guys know\u2014this is, like, the sacredest place.HORN RIOTER: I know, I know VideoSo the guy with the flag at the back of the shot, that\u2019s the QAnon Shaman, hes doing years in prison for that and only that. But the most interesting line in that entire clip, which is you may have seen we got from the New Yorker, hardly a right-wing source, is what the armed police officer says in that exchange to the dangerous QAnon Shaman, whos still rotting in prison. Quote, \"Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?\" Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing\u2014not even leave the building, just the Senate wing. Can you hear the terror in that officers voice? There is also film of what you saw if you were watching the coverage live that day. If youre watching January 6th unfold in real-time and you were probably like most people, no matter who you voted for, kind of shocked by it. Really, people swarming around the Capitol? Thats not good. But then you saw something pretty strange, you saw the police who were in charge of securing the perimeter, move aside the barricades and let the protesters or rioters or insurrectionists whatever you\u2019re going to call them\u2014a lot of people still in prison\u2014let them in the building. So why did they do that?BIDEN GROUPS KILLING OF CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER BY FARRAKHAN FOLLOWER WITH JAN. 6 DEATHSNow we know conclusively, because an awful lot has been reported on it, much divulged by the U.S. government, that law enforcement authorities knew there was going to be a significant protest that day. And so they were prepared. Apparently, they had snipers with shoot-to-kill orders on standby. So why exactly where the protesters allowed in, welcomed in, by law enforcement? There may be a completely good reason for that. Were not doubting that there is an honest explanation. We just dont know what it is. No one has ever explained that. Liz Cheney, who has berated the country in the most self-righteous possible way for weeks, months now, telling us we need to get the bottom of exactly what happened\u2014totally uninterested in finding out why that happened. Which everyone who was watching TV saw. And there are other questions that just dont make sense. These are not conspiracy theories, these are sincere questions based on actual footage, we brought this up a couple of times. Theres a man called Ray Epps, who was a longtime conservative activist. He was captured on camera at least three times, possibly more encouraging people on January 6th and the day before\u2014January 6th Eve, January 5th\u2014encouraging protesters to storm the Capitol.Epps: Tomorrow we need to go into the Capitol! Into the Capitol! CROWD: What? No! Epps: Peacefully. Crowd: fed! Fed! Fed! Fed! // Epps: Ok folks, spread the word. As soon as the president is done speaking, we go to the Capitol. The Capitol is this direction VideoSo thats Ray Epps, again, we show that to you before Congressman Thomas Massie asked the attorney general, Whats that about? Is this guy going to be charged? Where is he? He was on the FBIs most-wanted list. Now hes not. Attorney general refused to answer the question. No one has answered the question again, theres not a conspiracy theory. Its a legitimate question. Why wont they answer it and whats the answer? And then theres this there are a number of people like this which could give you one other example. Now this man has been dubbed by internet sleuths as the scaffold commander. Now he was shot from a variety of different angles on videotape on January 6th, appearing to give orders to the crowd from an elevated position. Theres really no doubt if you watch the tapes and theyre all available online and if interested, you should that this guy was coordinating the movement of the crowd toward and into the United States Capitol. Now hes caught directly on camera. Theres facial recognition software out there, probably not too hard to find out who this guy is. If FBI agents can fly to Alaska and hassle old ladies on Social Security because they were present, they can probably find this guy. And yet, as far as we know, this guy who clearly had some kind of management role that day has not been arrested, has not been charged or even publicly identified. What is that about? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPScaffold Commander: on top of scaffolding yelling on a megaphone Okay we\u2019re in! We\u2019re in! Come on! We gotta fill up the Capitol! Come on! Come now! We need help Come now we need help! We\u2019re gonna fill up the Capitol. // shows crowd near bleachers Move forward, climb up over the wall. Get into those bleachersSo there he is, scaffold commander, commanding the crowd to break the law, exhorting them forward to break the law. There was the largest manhunt in American history conducted after this day, January 6th. Were still talking about it, as noted a year later. And yet this guy is not only unidentified, no new authority seems interested in the slightest and finding out who he is and why is that?This article is adapted from Tucker Carlsons opening commentary on the January 6, 2022, edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""

Photo by Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty ImagesFox News is told that the \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" team applied to get press credentials for the Jan. 6 hearing, but the House Radio/TV Gallery rejected the request because they are not considered \"news.\" The issue didnt go to the Radio/TV Correspondents Association, which usually handles credentialing.In addition to a regular Capitol Hill press pass, a special \"overlay\" is required for members of the press who want to be in the room for the Jan. 6 Committee hearings.Members of Colberts team could have been in House office buildings if they were invited, which they were.

Lawmakers evacuated the complex and temporarily suspended the certification of the Electoral College results as rioters broke through police lines and entered the building.A Capitol Police officer fatally shot Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, who was attempting to force her way into the House chamber. Another person died during the riot after suffering a drug overdose, and two others died naturally from medical emergencies. Brian Sicknick, a 42-year-Capitol Police officer, got hit with pepper spray during the chaos and died the next day after suffering from two thromboembolic strokes. Four other officers who responded to the riot committed suicide in the months following.

REUTERS/Jim BourgThe U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia had previously charged more than 700 people across the country for their alleged participation in the riot, including at least 81 current or former service members, CBS News reported. About 275 of those defendants have been charged with a felony offense of \"attempting to corruptly obstruct, influence, or impede\" the Electoral College certification.More than 150 of the defendants have pleaded guilty, and 71 had been sentenced as of Jan. 1, according to Politico. Most of these sentenced Jan. 6 offenders had been convicted of misdemeanors, such as illegally entering the Capitol building, and fewer than half of them have received prison time. The median prison sentence for the Capitol rioters was 45 days, as of Jan. 6, 2022. Oath Keepers founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes mugshot released Thursday. Collin County JailRobert Palmer \u2013 who admitted to throwing a wooden plank at police outside the Capitol and to spraying a fire extinguisher at officers, then throwing the empty device at police \u2013 has received the stiffest sentence to date, more than five years in prison.

The House of Representatives impeached Trump one week after the riot for \"incitement of insurrection,\" with 10 Republicans voting in favor, the most pro-impeachment votes ever from a presidents party. Trump left office on Jan. 20 and the Senate acquitted him more than three weeks later.This is a developing story. Check back for updates. Tyler ONeil is an editor at Fox News.

  "text": "Tucker Carlson: Unequal treatment under the law Tucker examines the disproportionate punishment given to those in the Capitol on Jan 6 and those participating in BLM protestsToday is the three-month anniversary of January 6th. For those who aren\u2019t good with dates or don\u2019t have calendars, this is the day we pause to remember the White supremacist \"QAnon insurrection\" that came so very close to toppling our government and ending this democracy forever. You saw what happened. It was carried live on television, every gruesome moment.A mob of older people from unfashionable zip codes somehow made it all the way to Washington, D.C., probably by bus. They wandered freely through the Capitol, like it was their building or something. They didn\u2019t have guns, but a lot of them had extremely dangerous ideas. They talked about the Constitution, and something called \"their rights.\" Some of them made openly seditious claims. They insisted, for example, that the last election was not entirely fair. The whole thing was terrifying. And then, as you\u2019ve been told so often, they committed unspeakable violence. By the time thousands of soldiers arrived to restore order, an unarmed woman, an Air Force veteran, lay dead. To this day, that woman is the one completely verified casualty of the insurrection, the only person whose death we can say definitively was caused by specific events on January 6th. We know how she died.The funny thing is, you almost never hear that woman\u2019s name. Possibly that\u2019s because she wasn\u2019t a Democratic member of Congress, or even a Joe Biden voter. She was a protestor. Her name was Ashli Babbitt. She was 35.We still don\u2019t know who shot Ashli Babbitt, or why. No one will tell us. But then, when you\u2019re fighting insurrectionists, you don\u2019t have to explain yourself. You just hyperventilate about QAnon, and then you do whatever you want. When a group of sad, disenfranchised people who have been left out of the modern economy show up at your office, you don\u2019t have to listen to their complaints, not for a second. Why would you? You thought listening to people\u2019s complaints was democracy? No, these people threaten democracy. You can even shoot one of them, if you want, and get away with it. Killing people without explaining yourself is an established part of counterinsurgency. If you don\u2019t believe it, check out what happened in the Second World War.TUCKER CARLSON: THE OCCUPATION OF WASHINGTON AND LIBERALS DEEPEST FEARCHUCK SCHUMER, JAN. 6: President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941, as a day that will live in infamy. Unfortunately, we can now add January 6th, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy.January 6th was equivalent to Pearl Harbor, says Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer has never really gotten appropriate credit for the grandeur of that statement, considering the fact that we entered the Second World War the day after Pearl Harbor. That war went on for four years. More than 400,000 Americans died. That was the cost of stopping fascism.We don\u2019t yet know the cost of stopping White supremacist QAnon insurrection, but you can be certain Chuck Schumer is prepared to have you pay whatever it costs. Joe Biden\u2019s Justice Department is on the front lines of this new war.Until late last month, a man called Michael Sherwin worked for the administration as a prosecutor in Washington. Sherwin bragged that his office rounded up about 400 people who were in or near the Capitol on Jan. 6. You may be wondering if 400 people really committed crimes that day. It depends how you define \"crime.\" Heres Michael Sherwins definition: CAPITOL RIOT: TOP PROSECUTOR SAYS EVIDENCE LIKELY SUPPORTS SEDITION CHARGES IN SOME CASESMICHAEL SHERWIN: After the 6th, we had an inauguration on the 20th. So I wanted to ensure, and our office wanted to ensure that there was shock and awe, that we could charge as many people as possible before the 20th. And it worked because we saw through media posts that people were afraid to come back to D.C. because theyre like, \"If we go there, were gonna get charged.\" ... We wanted to take out those individuals that essentially were thumbing their noses at the public for what they did.So now it\u2019s clear. It wasn\u2019t that 400 people broke actual laws. No, their crime, said the federal prosecutor, was \"thumbing their noses at the public,\" meaning the Democratic Party. It wasn\u2019t \"insurrection.\" It was showing disrespect to Joe Biden and his enforcers like Michael Sherwin, and that can\u2019t happen.That\u2019s why Michael Sherwin decided to use \"shock and awe\" \u2014 to teach them a permanent lesson about expressing their political opinions. As Sherwin explained, \"the scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably DOJ history.\"And he may be right. How big and how serious is this investigation into those insurrectionists? So serious that the FBI has stopped investigating other crimes, and not minor crimes.NEWT GINGRICH: DEMOCRATS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DEMONS THEY ARE UNLEASHINGAccording to USA Today, \"Investigators who typically work cases involving the trafficking of drugs, child pornography and sex have taken calls from rioter\u2019s [sic] angry ex-wives and former girlfriends and employers turned tipsters.\"So, in order to send a message to people with unacceptable political ideas in Washington, D.C., we\u2019re not going after people who sell fentanyl, a drug that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, or child pornographers. They won\u2019t be punished. So who are these people who are being perused in lieu of tracking down fentanyl dealers and child pornographers? Who\u2019s experiencing the Biden administrations \"shock and awe\"?Well, people like Anthony Alfred Griffith of Oklahoma. Griffith didnt throw fire bombs at a police car. He didn\u2019t loot anything. He didnt torch a Wendys. He did something far worse. According to KFOR-TV:\"Griffith walked into the U.S. Capitol building through the open doors on January 6, telling the agents he did not see any police officers as he entered the building. He then went into a nearby office where he interacted with some individuals before exiting the building. However, he reentered the U.S. Capitol Building again a short time later, where he meandered through the hallways and took a few photos.\"SUSPECTED TERRORISTS APPREHENDED AT SOUTHERN BORDER: MCCARTHY REQUESTS CLASSIFIED FBI, CIA BRIEFINGFor that act of terrorism, Anthony Griffith faces seven years in prison. Prosecutor Michael Sherwin is fine with that. At one point in his interview with \"60 Minutes,\" Sherwin was asked about bringing sedition charges against the people he arrests, the people who meandered. Sure, he replied. Why not?SCOTT PELLEY: Sedition occurs when anyone opposes by force the authority of the United States, or by force hinders or delays the execution of any law of the United States ... Do you anticipate sedition charges against some of these suspects? SHERWIN: I believe the facts do support those charges. And I think that, as we go forward, more facts will support that, Scott.Meandering is sedition, says Michael Sherwin.WHY DO SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE THINK THE RULES DONT APPLY TO THEM? Just for reference, federal prosecutors aren\u2019t supposed to reveal themselves as partisan lunatics on television. Sherwin\u2019s comments were so grotesquely out of line that a federal judge appointed by Barack Obama, Amit Mehta, said he was considering issuing a gag order to make Michael Sherwin be quiet. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals -- the most powerful appellate court in the country -- just ordered the DOJ to start distinguishing between actual criminals, and people who walked through open doors inside the Capitol building.That ruling came after the DOJ tried to convince a judge that two defendants -- Lisa Eisenhart and her son, Eric Munchel - should face indefinite detention. Neither Lisa Eisenhart nor her son damaged any property at the Capitol or committed any violence. They just walked in to what we used to refer to as the People\u2019s House.And yet, somehow Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ convinced a trial judge that Lisa Eisenhart was a \"threat to our Republic,\" and that her son was a \"would-be martyr.\" Keep in mind, these are people whose only crime was trespassing in the Capitol. We\u2019re not endorsing that, but some perspective please.It took a ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to bring some perspective.CAPITOL RIOTER CHARGED WITH ASSAULTING DC OFFICER BURIED STOLEN POLICE BADGE IN BACKYARD: FBI\"Two individuals who did not engage in any violence and who were not involved in planning or coordinating the activities \u2014 seemingly would pose little threat,\" the appellate panel wrote. Yeah, seemingly.But the judges still didnt release Eric Munchel or Lisa Eisenhart. Thats how much power these prosecutors have. They can keep you in prison even when a three-judge appellate panel concludes theres no reason for you to be in prison.Thats probably why prosecutors still havent, as of tonight, released a man called Jacob Chansely, otherwise known as the \"Chewbacca Guy.\" Like Eric Munchel and Lisa Eisenhart, Jacob Chansely isnt accused of committing any act of violence. Hes not accused of breaking any property. What exactly did he do? We can answer that question. Video shows him walking through the Senate chamber.\"Chewbacca Guy\" is still in jail. He\u2019ll be there indefinitely. Before you shrug that off, think about what that\u2019s actually like. You don\u2019t want to think about it.CAPITOL RIOTER QANON SHAMAN DENIED PRE-TRIAL RELEASE AFTER PUBLICITY STUNT JAILHOUSE INTERVIEW, JUDGE SAYSA number of people arrested on Jan. 6 are still rotting in the D.C. municipal lockup, one of the foulest detention centers in the country. Its a truly repulsive, mismanaged place. Ask anyone from Washington, D.C. what they would do not to be thrown in the D.C. jail. It\u2019s that bad. Some say they\u2019ve been beaten, not surprisingly, by guards there. Lawyers for one, a man called Ryan Samsel, say he was beaten so badly, he has a skull fracture and is now blind in one eye.How many Antifa rioters or BLM vandals can say that? Did they lose their eyesight from being beaten in jail? Well, as a group, they didnt spend much time in jail. Most were spring on bail immediately, which politicians like Kamala Harris helped them pay.Last summer, for example, authorities released a terrorism suspect in Oklahoma called Eric Christopher Ruffin, after Black Lives Matter posted his $750,000 bond. According to authorities, Ruffin, \"encouraged others to burn an Oklahoma County sheriffs van and an Oklahoma City bail bonds business May 30. The van was destroyed. CJs Bail Bonds had $8,850 in damage from broken windows.\"But Eric Christopher Ruffin went home, and he went home for one reason: Unlike the Chewbacca Guy, he didnt upset the people in charge. He didnt walk in their \"sacred chamber\" and talk about \"liberty and rights.\" He just tried to vaporize some police vehicles, and that\u2019s exactly what our political class wanted him to do. So he\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s fine. He hasn\u2019t lost his eyesight getting a beating in jail.TUCKER CARLSON: HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE FOOLS OF THE SO-CALLED EXPERTSThis kind of thing, unequal treatment under the law, is on stark display across the country right now. We could spend an hour giving you examples, but here are a couple:On Saturday, police say, a criminal released on \"emergency coronavirus bail\" stabbed an elderly Asian woman to death in Riverside, California.The suspect, Darlene Montoya, was in jail for a serious crime -- shed been accused of assault with a deadly weapon. But, is that really as serious as meandering through the Capitol building? No, of course not, it\u2019s not \"insurrection.\" So, Darlene Montoya got to walk out of jail and find someone else to hurt.In December, a New York judge released a murder suspect named Jordon Benjamin, just in time for Benjamin to go out and allegedly stab a woman in the stomach. Jordon Benjamin then got out of jail again. VideoMeanwhile, in Detroit, a judge decided to release four felons who had been convicted of criminal sexual assault, and another 14 people who had committed assault. The judge claimed the coronavirus justified their release. According to prosecutors, one of those felons went out and raped three women at knifepoint.Why haven\u2019t you read this? No one covers any of this because it happens too often to notice.FRIEND OF PAKISTANI IMMIGRANT UBER EATS DRIVER KILLED IN DC: ALL LIVES ARE PRECIOUSLast month, however, one of these murders was caught on video. It was impossible to ignore. Two teenage girls -- one 15, and one 13 -- carjacked and killed a Pakistani immigrant driver called Mohammad Anwar. He has kids, and was just trying to work, trying to make a buck. As Mohammad Anwar lay dying on the sidewalk, one of the girls complained that the real crisis was she couldn\u2019t find her cellphone.You kill a guy who\u2019s just trying to work, and then you can\u2019t even be bothered to notice as he dies on the sidewalk because you\u2019re worried about your phone. There\u2019s a big problem with these girls. They\u2019re young, for sure, but they did something awful.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThey\u2019re not being treated that way. They got a plea deal. According to news accounts, theyll be released as soon as they turn 21, if not earlier. Theres a good chance the Chewbacca Guy will spend more time in jail for trespassing than Mohammad Anwars killers will spend for murder. Thats not an accident, this disproportionate treatment of crimes. If you\u2019re an autocrat, the biggest threat isn\u2019t people who commit actual violence. You can use that as your shock troops, and the people who run our country actually have.The biggest threat to you, if you\u2019re an autocrat, is people who mock you, and don\u2019t take you seriously, and sneer at you. You want them in prison, and autocrats are doing just that.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlsons opening commentary on the April 6, 2021 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""

Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.Senate Republicans on Friday halted an effort to form a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission to investigate the Capitol attack, marking the first successful legislative filibuster mounted by the GOP minority. The legislation needed 60 votes Friday to overcome a GOP filibuster, but Republicans blocked the legislation from advancing during a procedural vote. The vote was 54 to 35. Just six Republicans joined with Democrats: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Rob Portman of Ohio.BRIAN SICKNICKS MOTHER VISITS CAPITOL TO PUSH FOR JAN. 6 COMMISSION: I COULDNT STAY QUIET ANY MOREThe House already passed legislation on May 19 to form the independent panel with support from 35 Republicans, despite opposition from former President Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. But the legislation faced an uphill climb in the 50-50 split Senate, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also opposing the commission. McConnell argued there are already enough investigations into the Jan. 6 attack.

HOUSE APPROVES LEGISLATION TO FORM JAN. 6 BIPARTISAN COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CAPITOL RIOTOn Jan. 6, hundreds stormed the Capitol seeking to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Bidens Electoral College win. They violently overtook police officers, destroyed Capitol property and called for the killing of then-Vice President Mike Pence. The mob briefly stopped the certification process in Congress as lawmakers had to evacuate the chambers and take cover. In the end, 140 police officers were injured and five people died, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who suffered a stroke after the attack.More than 400 people have been charged criminally in the Jan. 6 riot.

  "text": "Tucker Carlson: Lawmakers helped these insurrectionists from Stephen Colberts show Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the arrest of Stephen Colbert staffers after they breached the Capitol building on Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy Monday, if you could call it that. But you cant. Like most Americans, youre probably still trying to digest what has happened over these past four days. Profound national trauma is like that. Once you face something unimaginably horrible, nothing is ever the same. Nothing will ever be the same. Like prison, it changes a man. This is not an easy time for any of us. We get it. Were literally \u2013 literally \u2013 still shaking as we think about how close this country came to losing our democracy last Thursday. Last Thursday was June 16th, a day forever branded in our memory, a day that has joined the pantheon of tragic turning points in human history. Where were you on 6/16? Youll never forget and neither will we. At the time, we were preparing a show on Tony Fauci and his push for a new Corona shot for kids. It seemed important then. It seems so trivial now. As we were speaking on the air at that very moment, a team of seven saboteurs had entered the Capitol grounds and then proceeded, as saboteurs do, to breach the Capitol itself. Inside those hallowed grounds, within the very womb of democracy, these wreckers began their hunt for sitting members of Congress. That happened, ladies and gentlemen, and if it sounds shocking to you, it gets more harrowing from there. This was not some spontaneous outbreak of insurrection. No, this was a meticulously planned coup from afar. The group in the Capitol was under the direct control of an extremist called Stephen Colbert, who as a White man, is, by definition a White extremist. BIDEN TAKES SHOT AT REPORTER SAYING RECESSION COULD BE INEVITABLE: DONT MAKE THINGS UP VideoThis White extremist, Stephen Colbert, had a fifth column within the Capitol to help him pull off his diabolical plan. He had members of Congress in his employ. Members of Congress who, believe it or not, helped the insurrectionists enter the Capitol, just open the doors and let them walk in. Yes, that can happen and that fifth column included Adam Schiff of California, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, and a new member called Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, besmirching his family name. Those three members of Congress allowed the wreckers inside the Longworth House Office Building. While inside, the insurrectionists tried to gain access to a restricted area, but they were thwarted by brave law enforcement who arrived, risking their very lives to remove the insurrectionists from the premises. But it wasnt enough because hours later, an aide to Congressman Auchincloss secretly permitted the insurrectionists to reenter the Capitol complex. And then around 8:30 p.m., they cause some kind of disturbance. The details are murky as of tonight, but according to one report, they were banging on windows inside the Capitol, trashing the place, committing violence against our democracy. And for that, apparently, we are hearing tonight, they were put in jail, but within hours they were out again. Now, the man who controlled this attempted to coup, Stephen Colbert, knew exactly what he was doing. He knew the stakes. He knew the crimes he was committing and we know that because just last year, this White extremist, Stephen Colbert, explained that grown men who unlawfully enter the Capitol to harass sitting members of Congress are not pranksters. Theyre not protesters. Theyre domestic terrorists. US CAPITOL POLICE ARREST STEPHEN COLBERT STAFFERS AT HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL ENTRY STEPHEN COLBERT: Lord have mercy. There are some dark subjects that we talk about on the show occasionally, but Ive rarely been as upset as I am tonight. This is the most shocking, most tragic, least surprising thing Ive ever seen and his followers did what he told them to do. Behave in a way, thats ...whats the word? Deplorable. One of these domestic terrorists even broke into Speaker Pelosis office and put his feet up on her desk. They now live in an alternate universe that is now collapsing in on itself. Its like a black hole of Whiteness, and this was never some sort of peaceful protest. This was Charlottesville come home to roost. Oh, its shocking. These are domestic terrorists. Stephen Colbert, in what the literary community refers to as foreshadowing, described his own coup, and yet Stephen Colbert somehow still has access to the airwaves and to digital media, spreading his hate unfettered, convincing future generations of insurrectionists to do what his team of saboteurs did last week. That must stop. People who plan coups must be silenced. Theres recent precedent for that, and anyone who disagrees should be disconnected from Amazon Web Services immediately. No spreading hate, but stopping White extremist Stephen Colbert from passing on his message of insurrection to the country wont solve what the rest of us are living with and thats trauma and like all trauma, journalists are affected most profoundly.

Well, the obvious candidates, Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and speaking of crying, Adam Kinzinger. Theyre the naturals. We called them today to see what theyre planning. How are we going to commemorate this latest insurrection? They havent gotten back to us yet, probably sleeping or weeping.

We apologized. Adam Kinzinger, we can recover. But theres only one path toward recovery and if you talk to any recovery expert, they will tell you the way to recover is to viciously punish the people who hurt your feelings\u2014step one. Its always step one. So, were going to have to mete out some pretty serious punishment. Stephen Colberts team of insurrectionists have been jailed for one night. Thats not a lot. The penalty for insurrection is death. Were not calling for that here. This is a moderate show. These are our fellow Americans. We owe them a second chance. Thankfully, theres recent precedent to help guide an appropriate punishment. "

Thirty-one percent of those questioned said the former president should not be charged, with one in five saying they don\u2019t know enough to form an opinion.The poll was conducted June 23-27, following five public hearings by the Democratic dominated House select committee investigating the riot at the Capitol \u2013 which aims to produce testimony showing Trump\u2019s potential criminal culpability in fueling the attack.

  "text": "Jan. 6 Committee refers Trump to DOJ for criminal prosecution \"The Story\" welcomes Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram as he breaks down the latest on the January 6 Committees final meeting on former President Trump.Legal experts say that the House January 6 Committees criminal referrals of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for his involvement in the 2021 Capitol protests are \"theater\" and will likely be ignored by the DOJ, and they could possibly have a counterproductive effect should the DOJ decide to bring charges.The Jan. 6 panel held what is expected to be their final meeting Monday and voted unanimously to issue criminal referrals to the DOJ on Trump for obstructing an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to defraud the federal government, making a false statement, and inciting, assisting or aiding and comforting an insurrection.The committee\u2019s unprecedented criminal referral holds no official legal weight, and a final determination in whether to pursue the charges will be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland.Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy, former federal prosecutor, called the referrals \"theater\" since they don\u2019t have any legal binding. He believes the DOJ will \"ignore\" the referrals for that reason and because they could be a prosecutorial liability in the DOJ\u2019s ongoing probe into Trump. The House January 6 committee voted unanimously to issue criminal referrals to the DOJ on former President Donald Trump. AP Photo/Patrick Semansky/FileTRUMP REFERRED TO DOJ FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION BY JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE\"In effect, it is theater because there it doesnt have any binding effect,\" McCarthy said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"I think the Justice Department will ignore it.\"\"The concern that the Justice Department has, or at least should have, is that they [the criminal referrals] can have the counterproductive effect of undermining whatever prosecution, if any, that the Justice Department decides to bring because they give former President Trump the ability to make the claim, if hes charged, that the charges are the result of political pressure rather than evidence,\" McCarthy added.\"Even if they brought criminal charges that were based solely on evidence that they believed was reliable, they would still have to combat an argument in the trial that a heavily dominated Democratic committee induced the Democratic Justice Department to bring criminal charges in order to sideline the sitting Democratic president\u2019s likely rival in the 2024 election, which is not a position to want to be in as a prosecutor,\" McCarthy said.Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley, another former prosecutor and professor at Georgetown University Law School, said Monday\u2019s business meeting that was heavily choreographed \"missed the mark\" in an effort to present a case that Trump should be criminally charged. The House January 6 committee will release its final report on Wednesday. Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesMIKE PENCE SAYS DOJ SHOULDNT BRING CHARGES AGAINST TRUMP AFTER JAN. 6 HEARINGS CONCLUDE\"The failure of the committee to offer any new and direct evidence of criminal conduct was telling,\" Turley said. \"The fact is that the [January] 6 Committee failed to change many minds largely because of what was on display in the final public meeting.

The poll, conducted by CBS News and YouGov from Dec. 27-Dec. 30 asked Americans \"What happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021?\" \"Descriptions of what happened are also similar to how they were a year ago after it happened,\" CBS News wrote in its article on Sunday. \"People widely call it a protest that went too far, but how much further becomes more partisan.

Meanwhile, the graphic showed that 47% of Republicans viewed Jan. 6 as \"patriotism\" and 56% viewed it as \"defending freedom,\" something less than 13% of Democrats agreed with. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.6 points. While CBS acknowledged in its report that Americans \"widely call it a protest that went too far,\" the liberal network significantly downplayed the bipartisan nature of that response. For starters, \"a protest that went too far\" was the overwhelming favorite of the 2,046 Americans who were polled with 76% agreeing with that characterization of Jan. 6. The second most popular result was \"trying to overturn the election and keep Donald Trump in power\" with 63%. Both of those options were omitted in the graphic bolstered by CBS.

We stood together and said an angry mob would not get veto power over the rule of law in our nation, not even for one night.\"McConnells comments came a week after the House voted to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection.\" Since his election defeat, Trump has refused to concede, claimed he won the election in a landslide and spread allegations of extensive election fraud despite courts repeatedly rejecting his claims.The culmination of his efforts to stop Biden from taking office came when he called his supporters to Washington on Jan. 6 and whipped up the crowd before they marched to the Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying Bidens win.The insurrection forced Congress to abruptly recess and take shelter.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the incoming majority leader, met with McConnell later Tuesday afternoon for about 30 minutes to discuss a new power-sharing agreement, Biden cabinet nominations and how to proceed on impeachment. \"All I\u2019m going to say is we discussed a whole lot of issues,\" Schumer said as he departed McConnells office.

Trump and those working with him spread false information about the outcome of the presidential election and pressured state officials to overturn the results, potentially violating multiple federal laws, the panel said.\"The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States,\" the committee wrote in a filing submitted in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesNANCY PELOSI JAN. 6 PODIUM GRABBER GETS TWO MONTHS IN PRISONThe 221-page filing marks the committee\u2019s most formal effort to link the former president to a federal crime, though the actual import of the filing is not clear. Lawmakers do not have the power to bring criminal charges on their own and can only make a referral to the Justice Department. The department has been investigating last year\u2019s riot, but it has not given any indication that it is considering seeking charges against Trump.The committee made the claims in response to a lawsuit by Trump adviser John Eastman, a lawyer and law professor who was consulting with Trump as he attempted to overturn the election. Eastman is trying to withhold documents from the committee.In a statement late Wednesday, Charles Burnham, Eastman\u2019s attorney, said his client has a responsibility \"to protect client confidences, even at great personal risk and expense.\"Burnham added, \"The Select Committee has responded to Dr. Eastman\u2019s efforts to discharge this responsibility by accusing him of criminal activity.\"The brief filed Wednesday was an effort to knock down Eastman\u2019s attorney-client privilege claims. In doing so, the committee argued there is a legal exception allowing the disclosure of communications regarding ongoing or future crimes.\"The Select Committee is not conducting a criminal investigation,\" Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, said in a statement. \"But, as the judge noted at a previous hearing, Dr. Eastman\u2019s privilege claims raise the question whether the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applies in this situation.\" Violent insurrectionists loyal to then-President Trump climb the west wall of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, FileTRUMPS NOT ON THE BALLOT BUT INT HE SPOTLIGHT AS TEXAS KICKS OFF PRIMARY SEASONThe filing also provides new details from the committee\u2019s interviews with several top Trump aides and members of former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s team, including chief of staff Marc Short and chief counsel Greg Jacob.The committee said it has evidence that Trump sought to obstruct an official proceeding \u2014 in this case, the certification of the election results \u2014 by trying to strong-arm Pence to delay the proceedings so there would be additional time to \"manipulate\" the results.\"The evidence supports an inference that President Trump and members of his campaign knew he had not won enough legitimate state electoral votes to be declared the winner of the 2020 Presidential election during the January 6 Joint Session of Congress, but the President nevertheless sought to use the Vice President to manipulate the results in his favor,\" the filing states.In a Jan. 6, 2021, email exchange between Eastman and Jacob revealed by the committee, Eastman pushed for Pence to intervene in his ceremonial role and halt the certification of the electoral votes, a step Pence had no power to take.Jacob replied: \"I respect your heart here. I share your concerns about what Democrats will do once in power. I want election integrity fixed. But I have run down every legal trail placed before me to its conclusion, and I respectfully conclude that as a legal framework, it is a results-oriented position that you would never support if attempted by the opposition, and essentially entirely made up.\"He added, \"And thanks to your bulls\u2014-, we are now under siege.\"The filing represents the most comprehensive look yet at the findings of the Jan. 6 committee, which is investigating the violent insurrection of Trump\u2019s supporters in an effort to ensure that nothing like it happens again. While the panel can\u2019t pursue criminal charges, members want to provide the public a thorough account of the attack, in which hundreds of people brutally beat police, pushed through windows and doors and interrupted the certification of Biden\u2019s win.

The panel has also sought out information from members of Congress and subpoenaed records and testimony from top social media platforms they believe had a hand in the spreading of election misinformation.The committee is expected to fully release its findings in a lengthy report or series of reports later this year, ahead of the midterm elections. The panel is also planning days or weeks of hearings starting in April with some of the witnesses who testified.In other transcripts released as part of the filing, former senior Justice Department official Richard Donoghue described trying to convince Trump that claims of election fraud were pure fiction. \"I told the President myself that several times, in several conversations, that these allegations about ballots being smuggled in a suitcase and run through the machines several times, it was not true, that we had looked at it, we looked at the video, we interviewed the witnesses, and it was not true.\"At one point, Donoghue said, he had to reassure Trump that the Justice Department had investigated a report that someone has transported a tractor-trailer full of ballots from New York to Pennsylvania. The department found no evidence to support the allegations, Donoghue said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe transcripts also shed colorful detail on a contentious Jan. 3, 2021, meeting at which Trump contemplated replacing his acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, with an assistant who promised to get to the bottom of the president\u2019s bogus claims of election fraud.That assistant, Jeffrey Clark, had been the department\u2019s top environmental enforcement lawyer for a period, a fact that led to some derision from colleagues at the meeting when it was pointed out that Clark had not been a criminal prosecutor.\"And he kind of retorted by saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve done a lot of very complicated appeals and civil litigation, environmental litigation, and things like that,\u2019\" Donoghue said. \"And I said, \u2018That\u2019s right.

I told my Uber driver to stay safe and went to work.\"It feels like a brand new day,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., gushed at a press conference in the Capitol shortly before noon.

Thankfully, the rioters never found us.Soon after, Capitol Police evacuated us to an \"undisclosed location.\" We were safe next door to the room where all the senators and their staff were located.But I will never forget the walk to the undisclosed location, the smell of pepper spray and tear gas outside the Chamber, and seeing garbage and debris strewn on the floor.

  "description": "Tucker Carlson rips comedian Stephen Colbert after his staffers breached the Capitol building and calls out the comedian's comments on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"",
  "text": "Tucker Carlson: Stephen Colbert sounds like a Biden flack Fox News host Tucker Carlson rips comedian Stephen Colbert following the arrest of his several staffers for breaching the Capitol on Tucker Carlson Tonight. So last Thursday, last week on Thursday, talk show host Stephen Colbert dispatched a group of seven of his employees to Washington, D.C. Their job? Break into the U.S. Capitol complex and harass lawmakers inside. So, the group dutifully arrived in the afternoon and were met almost immediately by uniformed Capitol Hill police officers who threw them out. But apparently on orders from Colbert, they returned. At about 4 p.m. on Thursday, the group reentered the building. Accounts vary as to what exactly happened next, but it seems clear that Colberts employees were led inside by an ally within the building, that would be a freshman member of Congress from Massachusetts called Jake Auchincloss. Once on federal property, Colberts employees did what they came to do, which was disrupt the business of Congress, and apparently they were not subtle about doing it. They pounded on doors and yelled. Whatever they did, it got peoples attention. It takes an awful lot for a police force controlled by Nancy Pelosi to arrest a group of left-wing entertainment figures, but thats exactly what happened next. Capitol Hill police arrested seven Colbert employees and brought them to jail. All seven of them were charged with unlawful entry. Now, thats the identical charge that hundreds of January 6 defendants have been prosecuted for. But unlike the January 6 defendants, Colberts employees were not sent to the DC jail for a year and a half in solitary confinement. No, they were released after only a night behind bars, and then they fled back to New York. Why is that? What exactly is the difference in the crime? As a legal question, we still dont know the answer. For some reason, Capitol Hill police have not released the surveillance tapes that would show exactly what Colberts employees did that so triggered the police force controlled by Nancy Pelosi that they were arrested, but whatever they did. Otherwise, sympathetic members of Congress are running away from it as quickly as they can. COLBERT STAFFERS ARREST: LATE-NIGHT HOST NOW ABOUT PUSHING POLITICS, BOOSTING DEMOCRATS, OTHER COMICS SAY Video\"We do not condone any inappropriate activity within the Capitol,\" Jake Auchincloss\u2019 office told us today. It was a factual matter. That is not true. In fact, Jake Auchincloss has a recent history of condoning criminal behavior in the Capitol. Just this March, surveillance cameras in the complex caught Jake Auchincloss\u2019 chief of staff, that would be a former Adam Schiff staffer called Tim Hyssop, vandalizing the front door of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greens Personal Office. Hyssop did this not once but several times violently, like a man obsessed. Capitol Hill police quickly filed an arrest warrant against him because Tim Haysom clearly posed a threat to a member of Congress. But Jake Auchincloss did not fire him. Instead, Jake Auchincloss defended Hyssop\u2019s vandalism as noble and justified. \"Our office is not going to apologize,\" read a long and self-righteous statement from Jake Auchincloss. In other words, \"We dont like Marjorie Taylor Greenes politics. Therefore, we can do whatever we want to her and we will.\" For the most part, the media ignored the story. So, Jake Auchincloss and Adam Schiff felt emboldened to go further. They invited Colberts employees to the Capitol to harass Marjorie Taylor Greene some more, which is what they were trying to do when they were arrested by Capitol Hill Police. FIVE LESSONS FOR JOE BIDEN FROM JIMMY CARTERS ONE-TERM PRESIDENCY Now, whatever you think of her politics, Marjorie Taylor Greene is a sitting member of Congress. Preventing her or any other member of Congress from carrying out official duties as a public representative is, by definition, an attack on democracy. So, how is what Stephen Colbert did different from what the protesters on January 6 have been convicted of doing? Thats a very good question and its a question that Colbert himself spent the weekend thinking about. His conclusion? Well, unlike Trump voters, Stephen Colbert is a very good person. Therefore, any comparison to Trump voters is not simply ridiculous. It is a moral crime. Watch. STEPHEN COLBERT: Now its predictable why these TV talkers are talking like this on the TV. They want to talk about something other than the January 6 hearings on the actual seditious insurrection that led to the deaths of multiple people and the injury of over 140 police officers, but drawing any equivalence between rioters storming our Capitol to prevent the counting of electoral ballots and a cigar-chomping toy dog is a shameful and grotesque insult to the memory of everyone who died and obscenely trivializes the service and the courage the Capitol Police showed on that terrible day. JOE IS NOT FINE: WATTERS RIPS MEDIAS LATEST CLEANUP FOR BIDEN AFTER BIKE TUMBLE Yeah, it was a toy dog. \"Its shameful.\" In other words, \"When you criticize me, youre really criticizing the brave Capitol Police officers who arrested the people who worked for me, the ones who committed the crimes I asked them to commit and I, for one, will not stand for that.\" Thats what he just said. Now, what you have there is not so much an explanation. In fact, it doesnt explain anything. Instead, its a masters class on whiny, rich, liberal self-righteousness. Its a distillation of a worldview that is so concise and so perfect, it is certain to be studied by cultural historians of the future, seeking to understand how our civilization collapsed. \"Not only am I not sorry, youre the criminal for bringing it up. Stop hitting me,\" he screams as he punches you in the face. That is passive aggression taken to the level of art. In any way, Colbert says, \"Shut up. Im a comedian with a toy dog, you cant criticize me.\" So, the question really is, is Stephen Colbert a comedian? Well, if youre one of the relatively few people still watching Stephen Colbert\u2019s show on CBS, youll have to admit it is hard to tell. Most nights, Stephen Colbert sounds like the notably unfunny Karine Jean-Pierre. He sounds like a Biden flack delivering whatever talking points the White House tells him to repeat and if you doubt that, heres what it looks like. JAN. 6 HEARING: ABCS DAVID MUIR, CHRIS CHRISTIE CLASH AFTER FORMER GOV INVOKES TREND OF DOUBTING ELECTIONS VideoSTEPHEN COLBERT: Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden did it. Hes our next president. STEPHEN COLBERT: The biggest story continues to be the one you were thinking about when you werent sleeping last night and its the one happening all over America, the protests in wake of the murder of George Floyd and please dont buy the false narrative that these are lawless mobs. The vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. STEPHEN COLBERT: Theres a simple, if extremely difficult solution, reduce the number of guns. Weve done it before and it worked. STEPHEN COLBERT: Russias invasion of Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis, but also it is a triumph of humanity. Take that, Putin. STEPHEN COLBERT: Okay, so I might have the most privilege of any White person youve ever met. How do I identify that in my own life? Because if I have White privilege, I want to be able to identify it. Give me some hints as to my White privilege. STEPHEN COLBERT: Vaccine! REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS CALL OUT REP. SCHIFF, ASK CAPITOL POLICE FOR INFO ON ARRESTS OF COLBERT SHOW STAFFERS \"Get the vax, peasants, surrender your guns, support Ukraine and remember, its called Kiev now.\" This isnt comedy. Its a very sad midlife crisis, but more than that, its information war being waged against television viewers on behalf of the Democratic Party. At least when the White House press secretary does it, she admits what shes doing. Colbert hides behind his former job as a comedian. \"It was all a joke. When people I dont like break into the Capitol, its insurrection. When we do it, its sketch comedy, right?\" Its getting harder to maintain that lie and heres how, you know, comedians have a sense of humor. It is, in fact, a job requirement, but Stephen Colbert does not. Stephen Colbert has lost his sense of humor along with the critical distance and perspective that make humor possible. At this point, hes just a partisan scold, and you know that for certain, because even as he watched the QAnon Shaman parade around the Capitol on January 6, Stephen Colbert did not laugh. Now, an actual comedian whatever is politics would have found that spectacle hilarious because\u2014lets be honest\u2014it was. THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: Hey man. Glad to see you guys. You guys are f------- patriots. Look at this guy. Hes gotten covered in blood. God bless him.

THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: Im good. Thank you. THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: Alight. THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: I got shot in the face. I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet. THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: Any chance I can get you guys to leave the same way? THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: We will, Ive been making sure they aint disrespecting the place. THE NEW YORKER JAN. 6 VIDEO: Ok, just want to let you guys know this is, like, the sacred-ist place. \"Hey,\" say the guy in the bear skin and the horn hat. Thats not hilarious? Yes, it is hilarious. \"No, hes a seditious insurrectionist,\" said Colbert, \"He needs to go to jail. Hes a terrorist,\" and when he was sent to jail, Colbert applauded. WILL CAIN ON WHITE HOUSES MANAGING OF BIDEN: WHAT YOURE WATCHING IS NOT LEADERSHIP Now, thats how Maoist countries act. Thats not how comedians act. So, Stephen Colbert may be a late-night host still for some reason, but he has zero sense of humor. He ought to step aside and let some young person who still gets the joke to have the job, but he wont. Heres Colbert on November 6, 2020. Watch. STEPHEN COLBERT: And if you did not know that Joe Biden was getting close to 270, Donald Trump just provided all the proof you will ever need. True story. Im wearing black tonight because I was getting dressed this afternoon and I thought he might try some shenanigans and it might be fitting to tell jokes while wearing something somber, if he goes down that dark path. STEPHEN COLBERT: So, we all knew he would do this. What I didnt know is that it would hurt so much. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT TUESDAY\u2019S ALABAMA AND GEORGIA RUNOFF ELECTIONS TEST OF HIS CLOUT VideoThose were real tears, the only real thing about that show. Were not trying to belabor the point, but the guys not a comedian. You watch a comedian, you think, \"that guys hilarious, Id love to meet him.\" Imagine eating a meal with Stephen Colbert. Chances are you somehow offend him over the course of a typical dinner by saying something he finds offensive. What are the chances of that? 100%. Stephen Colbert is a Karen. Hes a brittle, middle-aged woman whos always lecturing you about something. In fact, hes Elizabeth Warren. They even look alike. Have you seen them in the same room recently? No. Sad, he was talented at one point and so was Robert Smigel. Thats one of the coal bear employees who was also arrested last week. Simels been doing his dog puppet routine for 30 years. Thats the one that Colbert is now hiding behind.\" It was just a dog puppet.\" GREG GUTFELD: THE MEDIA IS DISTANCING ITSELF FROM JOE BIDEN BECAUSE THEY KNOW HE IS DONE The dog puppet was kind of funny during the Clinton administration. It is pure hackery now. Smigel keeps going because hes got a political message for him. \"Im going to beat you over the head with my political message.\" No one laughs at Robert Smigel anymore. Its pathetic. Whos funnier: Robert Smigel, or the guy who took pictures of himself at Nancy Pelosis desk on January 6? Be honest, its not even close. The guy at Pelosis desk is hilarious compared to the guy with the talking dog and none of them is half as funny. Again, sorry its true as Donald Trump and how do you know that? Show us the late night host who said anything half as amusing as Trumps Taco Bowl tweet. VideoEver? Any of them? No, never. These people are so afraid. Theyre so terrified, holding onto their stupid jobs late into middle age, that how do they respond to Cinco de Mayo? Fawning over the indigenous cuisine of the Latinx community. Nobody likes that and thats why in the end, Stephen Colbert has not a single Hispanic viewer. His audience is entirely self-hating White liberals like him. So, nobody watches anymore. Thats fine. Thats CBSs problem. But dont tell us youre a comedian and therefore exempt from the normal rules of behavior and the normal federal laws about trespassing because youre not. You did what they did, and you should be punished in exactly the same way. "

The letter was addressed to Pelosi, but was sent to other leaders like Sens. Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell; Reps.

This was a well-planned, coordinated insurrection at the United States Capitol,\" Sund wrote. \"The USCP does not have the manpower, the training of the capabilities to handle an armed insurrection involving thousands of individuals bent on violence and destruction at all costs.

Those MAGA events involved thousands of people but had a limited number amount of violence, injuries to officers and arrests, Sund said, adding that at no point at either of those events did people attempt to storm the Supreme Court building. Sund provided a timeline of his attempts to get a request for National Guard support on Jan. 6. He said he reiterated his urgent request for National Guard support to help shore up the perimeter of the Capitol in a call at 2:28 p.m., when Army Lt. General Walter Piatt allegedly stated, \"I don\u2019t like the visual of the National Guard standing a line with the Capitol in the background.\"When Sund said having Capitol police officers relieved from other posts to respond to the Capitol was not an option and that National Guard was needed, House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving said he would need to run the request up the chain of command at the Pentagon.\"The USCP needs more unilateral authority to implement its security planning and the ability to call in National Guard support when needed. Steps need to be taken to ensure National Guards ability to support USCP is seamless in the future,\" Sund wrote. He added, \"I also wish we had better intelligence and warnings as the possibility of this type of military-style armed insurrection. The entire intelligence community seems to have missed this.\"Before the National Guard arrived, more than 1,700 police officers from 18 nearby jurisdictions convened at the Capitol. Sund said he pushed for expedited delivery of helmets ordered for officers before the inauguration, and approximately 104 helmets were delivered on Jan. 4 to protect officers from individuals who might be armed in the crowds expected on Jan. 6. He recognized a \"number of systems broke down\" and that \"officials or officers who violated policies or directives, or even their oath, need to be held accountable.\"About a month has passed since the insurrection, and heightened security measures set in place before the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 still remain, including an eight-foot, barbed wire fence that stands around the heavily fortified Capitol complex. In an appearance on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, who alongside Sen. Lindsey Graham, has requested information about the insurrection from the Senate Sergeant of Arms, said he appreciated Sund for sending the letter and providing more of an insight into who knew what that day. \"I actually appreciate what the former chief of police of Capitol Police, Steven Sund, sent in the letter. And he lays out the diligence that he undertook to provide security around the capital,\" Johnson told Fox Business Networks Maria Bartiromo. \"It seems like he took pretty reasonable precautions. Hes obviously being one of the scapegoats here.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"Its a month has gone by and we still dont know. And yet we have these eight-foot tall fences with concertina wire completely surrounding the Capitol,\" he continued. \"Weve been told theyre going to be put in place since March at least.

I think we ought to take that fencing down and return to as normal of a position as possible,\" Johnson said. \"I think the fencing is being remade, is remaining in place to send a signal, a narrative that seventy-four million Americans had voted for President Trump are dangerous to our democracy.

Joshua Black, of Alabama, was shot in the face by a police projectile while breaching the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Court documents show him with blood on the side of his face while in the Senate chamber. Afterward, he also allegedly recorded YouTube videos with blood still on his cheek, recounting what happened. \"I had accomplished my goal. I pled the blood of Jesus on the Senate floor. You know, I praised the name of Jesus on the Senate floor,\" Black said in a video, according to an FBI affidavit. \"That was my goal.

Joshua Black shared YouTube videos recounting his experience entering the Capitol and the Senate floor, according to the FBI.

AP Photo/Susan WalshCommittee aides told Fox News the hearing will focus on the plot to pressure state officials to overturn valid election results, including how the Trump campaign drove a scheme to get \"fake electors\" transmitted to Washington, D.C., which set the stage for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The lawmakers will say President Trump was warned these false claims risked violence and undermining democracy. The hearing will feature Trump campaign officials and White House staff depositions, as well as state officials not on the in-person panels.TRUMP BLASTS JAN. 6 COMMITTEE, MIKE PENCE IN SPEECH TO EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN GROUPSLast weeks two hearings focused on the role Trump attorney John Eastman and others had in attempting to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn electoral college results. The other hearing featured testimony from Trump 2020 campaign aides and lawyers who said the president ignored their advice on Election Day and proceeded to push election fraud conspiracies that had no factual basis.During the Jan. 6 Committees first public hearing, held June 9 during primetime, the lawmakers focused on Trumps role in inciting the mob that attacked the Capitol.

The Jan. 6 committee, which includes Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kingzinger, will air their Thursday hearing during primetime.

Holder reportedly shot interviews with Trump and his inner circle both before and after the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Trump has not only rejected overtures to testify before the panel, but he has called on allies and former staffs to do likewise.MARK MEADOWS COMPLYING WITH DOJ SUBPOENA, TURNING OVER DOCUMENTS PREVIOUSLY SHARED WITH HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE Missing from the hearing will be testimony from Trump and other key players that where in the White House or Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. AP Photo/Evan Vucci Members of the committee, however, say their findings will speak for themselves.The hearing comes after the committees interview with Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, two weeks ago. Thomas voluntarily appeared before the committee after reports emerged she was allegedly in contact with the White House and lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin ahead of Jan. 6.The committees members, seven Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans, will each present a portion of their findings. Some will summarize the 15-month investigation, while others will focus on the alleged ties between Trump staffers and extremist groups that breach the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.While some evidence presented is likely to be new, few believe the committee has anything close to a smoking gun implicating Trump.GINNI THOMAS, WIFE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, AGREES TO JAN. 6 COMMITTEE VOLUNTARY INTERVIEWThat reality is something the panel is wrestling with as it holds what is likely its final hearing before the midterm election. Complicating the push for a clear resolution is that the panel has not heard testimony from Trump and other key players that were in the White House or Congress on Jan. 6.Not only has Trump refused to cooperate with the panel but so have the former presidents top congressional allies. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., has defied a congressional subpoena by the committee to sit for a deposition.\"The committee operates with the same kind of bias present at the Salem witch trials,\" said Biggs, who the committee alleges pressured state leaders in Arizona to decertify President Bidens 2020 election victory. \"Everyone is guilty and must demonstrate their innocence.\"Similarly defying the committees subpoenas have been Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Not only has Trump refused to cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel but so have the former presidents top congressional allies. Brent Stirton/Getty ImagesPerry is alleged by the committee to have been a key link between Trump and Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, who pushed for the DOJ to back the former presidents claim of electoral fraud in 2020. McCarthy, meanwhile, had a phone call with Trump as protesters stormed the capitol on Jan. 6.The committee has similarly had little luck in getting senior Trump administration staff to talk.Senior Trump White House official Peter Navarro, in particular, was indicted for contempt for Congress for defying the committees subpoena to testify. According to the committee, Navarro was responsible for spearheading Trumps efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\"He has written a book boasting about his role in planning and coordinating the activity of Jan. 6. We have many questions for Mr. Navarro,\" said Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel. Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, R-Pa., has refused to cooperate with the committee. Fox News Digital/Haris AlicNavarro, for his part, has cited executive privilege as the reason for his decision to not cooperate.Also likely missing from the committees hearing on Thursday will be former Vice President Mike Pence. The Indiana Republican, according to the committee, was the target of heavy pressure from Trump and allies to reject Electoral College votes from certain states while presiding over the tally on Jan. 6.Pence has said he would be open to testifying in front of the panel. The former vice presidents staff told Fox News Digital the committee had been in touch with the Pence legal team but that no progress has been made about him testifying.While key players in the Jan. 6 drama have been left out or refused to comply, the panel has found some success. Apart from gaining access to tens of thousands of documents, the committee has conducted nearly 1,000 interviews during its 15-month tenure. The Jan. 6 hearing is set to be televised with lawmakers unveiling new evidence and summarizing their 15-month investigation. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesApart from Thomas, those interviews were with high-profile White House figures, including Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, as well former Attorney General Bill Barr.Although the committee still could hold further hearings in preparation for the release of its final report later this year, the panel is quickly approaching its end date.The committee is set to disband at the end of this Congress unless lawmakers vote to reauthorize it next year. That likelihood is slim given that Republicans, who have refused to take part in the panels deliberations, are expected to win control of the House.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTop Republicans are even pledging to investigate the panels activities once in power. They say the committee has lacked legitimacy from its creation, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of the Republicans nominated to serve on the panel by McCarthy.\"It\u2019s the most political and least legitimate committee in American history,\" said McCarthy \"It has used congressional subpoenas to attack Republicans, violate due process and infringe on the political speech of private citizens.\" Haris Alic is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering Congress."

Because I saw video where Capitol officers were taking away barriers and unlocking doors for people.\" Several others seated with him agreed. Another man added, \"They opened the gates and let them in.\"Jordan followed-up: \"So it shouldn\u2019t be disqualifying for an elected official if they participate in January 6th?\" Most, if not all, either shook their heads or audibly responded, \"No.\"The male voter who answered the original question added, \"No, as long as he didn\u2019t strike anybody, he didn\u2019t hurt anybody.\" A female voter to his left brought up Ashli Babbitt, the U.S. Air Force Veteran who was killed by Capitol Police while trying to enter the inner chambers of the building. She said, \"And the only one that died was a protestor there, not a Capitol police officer.\" Another voter, elaborated, \"An unarmed female was shot by police.\" The female voter declared, \"That\u2019s the only one who died.\"Jordan rebutted the claim, stating, \"A police officer did die,\" and she received pushback. \"No,\" one responded swiftly, while another explained, \"He died of a heart attack.\" Another voter said, \"It was a stroke.\"She added, \"That\u2019s not on-site,\" referencing the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died from a stroke one day after allegedly being pepper-sprayed by rioters at the Capitol building. As Fox News Digital reported last year, \"the Washington, D.C., medical examiners office ruled that Sicknick suffered a stroke and died from natural causes. The determination of a natural cause of death meant the medical examiner found that a medical condition alone caused his death -- it was not brought on by an injury.\" More than 100 law enforcement members were injured that day during clashes with protesters.

But if you\u2019re there making your voice heard at the people\u2019s house no less, that\u2019s again, it\u2019s a fundamental constitutional right of an American citizen.

Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is signaling that she is poised to create a new committee to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, pushing closer to a partisan investigation of the attack after Senate Republicans blocked the creation of an independent probe.A person familiar with the matter said after a meeting with Democrats that Pelosi had told her colleagues that she would create a select panel. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private remarks. But Pelosi later denied that, telling reporters, \"No, I did not make that announcement.\"The new committee would come after the Senate voted earlier this month to block legislation to form a bipartisan, independent commission investigating the attack by former President Donald Trumps supporters. Pelosi said afterward that the House would step up investigations of the riot, in which a violent mob overran police, broke into the building and hunted for lawmakers to try to stop the certification of Joe Bidens election victory.\"No, I did not make that announcement.\" \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington, June 17, 2021. Associated Press NATIONAL GUARD MAY BE FORCED TO CUT TRAINING IF NOT REIMBURSED $521M IN COSTS SECURING CAPITOLA new select committee would put majority Democrats in charge of the investigation. More than three dozen Republicans in the House and seven Senate Republicans said they wanted to avoid a partisan probe, and they supported the legislation to form a commission, which would have been modeled after a similar panel that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Still, those numbers weren\u2019t strong enough to overcome GOP opposition in the Senate, where support from 1O Republicans is needed to pass most bills if all Democrats vote yes. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said he may hold a second vote after the legislation failed to advance last month, but there\u2019s no indication that Democrats can win the necessary support from three additional Republicans.Pelosi said earlier this month that the House \"can\u2019t wait any longer\" and would proceed with a probe. She said then that she was considering a select committee or having an existing committee conduct the investigation.Many Republicans have made clear that they want to move on from the Jan. 6 attack, brushing aside the many unanswered questions about the insurrection, including how the government and law enforcement missed intelligence leading up to the rioting and the role of Trump before and during the insurrection.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSome Republicans have gone so far as to downplay the violence, with one suggesting the rioters looked like tourists and another insisting that a woman, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the House chamber through a window was \"executed.\"Last week, 21 Republicans voted against giving medals of honor to Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police to thank them for their service that day. Dozens of those officers suffered injuries, including chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones.Seven people died during and after the rioting, including Babbitt, three other Trump supporters who died of medical emergencies and two police officers who died by suicide in the days that followed. A third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes."

Hank Johnson compared parents who protested at school board meetings to \"MAGA Republicans\" who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 during a committee hearing.Georgia Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson claimed \"MAGA Republicans\" descended on school board meetings in a similar manner to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot during a committee hearing.On Wednesday, the House Committee of the Judiciary met to discuss H. Res. 1238, which requested President Biden \"provide certain documents to the House of Representatives relating to the October 4, 2021 memorandum issued by the Attorney General entitled Partnership Among Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Law Enforcement to Address Threats Against School Administrators, Board Members, Teachers, and Staff.\"In October, Attorney General Merrick Garland originally sent a memorandum on ongoing protests at school boards regarding coronavirus guidelines and critical race theory. Garland\u2019s memo was in response to the National School Boards Associations NSBA letter that likened these protests to \"domestic terrorism,\" leading to intense backlash from parents and Republican lawmakers. By February, Fox News exclusively reported that the head of the NSBA had advanced notice of the memo, suggesting coordination between the NSBA and the federal government against protesters.

These school board meetings have become a place where MAGA extremists go to disrupt based on false and deceptive information imparted to them by the former president and his MAGA extremist followers, deception about what\u2019s being taught to our children,\" Johnson said.He added, \"It\u2019s really a travesty that we come today in Congress just a couple of months before a very important election that my MAGA supports on the other side of the aisle are intent on winning so they can take control of this body and then they will have the ability to harass and try to intimidate the administration with their oversight powers.\"He later compared parents who protested school board meetings to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots\"January 6, 2021, will never be forgotten, an infamous day in American history. MAGA Republicans descended upon the Capitol, engaged in an insurrection. They occupied the Capitol. Five people were killed, hundreds injured, including hundreds of Capitol Hill police officers attacked and bludgeoned. It was a day that we\u2019ll never forget,\" the lawmaker said. \"And people on the local level at affected school board meetings, they won\u2019t forget the MAGA Republicans descending on their school board meetings after January 6, like January 6, disrupting meetings.

Things had gotten so far out of hand. And by the way, there is not one scintilla of evidence, either direct or indirect, that there was any coordination between the Biden Administration and the National School Boards Association that caused that letter to be sent seeking federal assistance,\" Johnson said.However, he later admitted that the memo was \"indicating that there was going to be some coordination between the federal government and local governments to maintain order at school board meetings.\"Since President Biden\u2019s condemnation of \"MAGA Republicans\" as a threat to democracy, Democrats, including the president, have been vague on who falls under that category, instead pointing to broader issues such as pro-life policies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAlthough Johnson condemned both the parent protesters and Capitol rioters as a \"threat to democracy,\" he previously took part in a protest of his own outside a Senate building on July 2021.

Sund said he spoke to both Stenger and Irving about requesting the National Guard in the days before the riot, and that Irving said he was concerned about the \"optics\" of having them present. Irving denied that, saying Sund\u2019s account was \"categorically false.\"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News earlier this month that he is in favor of a 9/11-style commission to examine key details that contributed to last month\u2019s deadly riot at the Capitol.Republicans have signaled that evidence could show that Democrat leaders were aware of the threat and did little to prevent the Jan. 6 attack.Pelosi said the commission will \"investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex \u2026 and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.\"Earlier this month, Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, told Fox News\u2019 \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo\" that Trump issued a \"direct order\" to have up to 10,000 troops ready. Trump told Hilton that contrary to reports that have been circulating, he was not watching the riot in real-time and only began following the events later on when he heard about the chaos.Trump said he hated to see the riot but compared it to unrest that occurred in cities like Portland and Seattle.\"I hate to see any of that, but it is a double standard,\" he said.The Associated Press contributed to this report Edmund DeMarche is a senior news editor for FoxNews.com.

Jacob Chansley answered questions from \"60 Minutes Plus\" for an interview first aired on \"CBS This Morning,\" a day before a Washington, D.C., judge is set to hear arguments Friday over his pre-trial release. Prosecutors argued in a new filing on Monday that Chansley is a danger to the community, explaining he held a speared weapon as he confronted officers inside the Capitol, wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence and spoke about ridding the government of traitors.QANON SHAMAN CHARGED IN CAPITOL RIOT TO GET ORGANIC FOOD IN JAIL But Chansley categorized his actions on Jan. 6 differently, rejecting the notion that what he did was an attack on this country. He also claimed he remained peaceful after officers \"waved\" him into the Capitol building. \"My actions were not an attack on this country. That is incorrect. That is inaccurate entirely,\" he told \"60 Minutes Plus\" correspondent Laurie Segall, describing instead how he prayed, sang songs inside the building and prevented theft and vandalism. \"I sang a song and that\u2019s a part of Shamanism.

I regret entering that building with every fiber of my being,\" he added. \"But you don\u2019t regret the loyalty to Donald Trump?\" Segall asked. Chansley responded flatly, \"No.\"Authorities have said Chansley was allegedly among the first people to force their way into the Capitol building on Jan. 6, disobeyed orders to leave, refused an officer\u2019s request to use Chansley\u2019s bullhorn to tell rioters to leave the Senate chamber, called Pence a traitor and wrote a note to the then-vice president saying, \"It\u2019s only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"While prosecutors say the spear attached to a flagpole carried by Chansley into the Capitol was allegedly a weapon, his attorney has characterized the spear as an ornament.

They are hoping that these hearings will somehow alter their failing prospects.\" JAN. 6 HEARING: TESTIMONY FOCUSED ON TRUMPS UNFOUNDED CLAIMS OF WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUDTrump used much of the 12-page document to rehash his unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 Presidential Election was supposedly \"Rigged and Stolen.\" \"Politicians from both parties, but mostly the Democrats, worked in conjunction with corporate elitists to strip Americans of our right to elect our own leaders,\" Trump said.  File photo of former President Donald Trump. AP Photo/Andrew HarnikHe added: \"The Establishment is holding on as tightly as they can to their power as they watch it slip from their grasp. Our country is in a nosedive. Americans are struggling to fill their gas tanks, feed their babies, educate their children, hire employees, order supplies, protect our border from invasion, and a host of other tragedies that are 100% caused by Democrats who obtained power through a rigged election, and the people of our country are both angry and sad.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe rebuttal came on the second day of a House panel investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021. The nine-member panel is trying to make the case that Trump, and those allies who helped him, were deliberately lying as he pushed election falsehoods in the weeks ahead of the violent insurrection, that the rioters who broke into the Capitol that day and interrupted the certification of President Joe Bidens victory were echoing Trumps lies that he, not Biden, had rightfully won the election.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

  "text": "Fox News Flash top entertainment headlines for January 12 Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Check out whats clicking today in entertainment.The wives of two prominent country artists are speaking out after catching backlash for comments they made referencing the riot at the U.S. Capitol building last week.On Jan. 6, supporters of President Trump gathered in Washington, D.C., in a demonstration that led to riots in which hundreds of people breached the security at the U.S. Capitol building while the Senate was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s electoral college votes. Five people died as a result of the riots. As those involved begin to see legal ramifications, Brittany Aldean and Brittney Kelley are clarifying previous posts they shared about the rioters.Aldean, the wife of country singer Jason Aldean, shared her thoughts on the matter, including a repost of an image that made the since-debunked claim that two of the men who breached the Capitol building were not protesters for Trump, but members of Antifa. The Associated Press has since deemed claims that any known Antifa members were present at the Capitol Wednesday as false.JASON ALDEANS WIFE BRITTANY STANDS UP FOR FELLOW REPUBLICANS, TRUMP AFTER BACKLASH FROM BIDEN SUPPORTERSAccording to Rolling Stone, Instagram removed the image, prompting Aldean to take to her Instagram Story to complain about being censored.  Brittany Aldean and Brittney Kelley were criticized for seemingly supporting the Capitol riots. Getty Images, File\"Instagram wanted me to know that it was against their guidelines to post,\" she said in a video. \"It\u2019s getting so ridiculous the filters you put on everyone that\u2019s against your narrative. It\u2019s unbelievable and it\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s just really sad what this world\u2019s coming to.\"She further called for unity in her Story from Sunday. \"Apparently freedom of speech doesnt apply to everyone and thats the issue I have. I have AMAZING conversations with my liberal friends and we can agree to disagree. Its the people that arent willing to hear you that chap my a--,\" she said.Meanwhile, fans of Brittney Kelley, the wife of Florida Georgia Line\u2019s Brian Kelley, thought she expressed her support for the rioters last week by sharing a photo of herself and her famous husband driving in a convertible truck while waving an American flag. \"God please protect our Country & the people who fight for our freedom everyday,\" she captioned the image. \"Praying for peace and unity for all \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8.\"JASON ALDEAN RESPONDS TO CRITICISM OVER MASK-FREE DISNEY PICTURE: CHILL OUTHowever, in a follow-up post, Kelley made it clear to her 186,000 followers that she does not condone violence of any kind, regardless of political affiliation. \"I know all of my real folks here know where my heart is at and I appreciate the support,\" she began a comment on a photo of the Capitol building. Brittany Aldean has spoken out about her support of President Trump in the past. Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, FileShe continued: \"so many of you, scared to even speak out to say, \u2018you\u2019re praying\u2019 or state your opinions for fear of being \u2018canceled\u2019. I was taught to stand for what you believe is right. Holding the American flag and calling on God for peace is not a way of expressing what \u2018side\u2019 I\u2019m on.\"Kelley went on to say that she does not condone \"mobs/cults rioting or storming buildings. She also noted that she does not believe \"patriots\" are the people who stormed the Capitol.

Love you all.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRepresentatives for neither Aldean nor Kelley immediately responded to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.However, the situation caught the attention of fellow country artist Maren Morris who seemed to be commenting on the situation when she tweeted: \"And how do some singer\u2019s wives conveniently not know the difference between marching for racial injustice and Nazis breaching our Capitol because their guy didn\u2019t win?\" Tyler McCarthy covers entertainment at Foxnews.com."

In campaign materials, he described himself as a mortgage loan officer and said he and his wife run a teen center. He opposed requiring children to mask in school as a means to contain the coronavirus pandemic.In a note to families and school staff Wednesday, School Board President Carrie Thibodeaux announced Slaughter had resigned, and that his resignation would be discussed at Thursday nights board meeting.WASHINGTON CITY FORCED TO REMOVE TASTELESS KAREN-THEMED HALLOWEEN DISPLAY AFTER RESIDENTS COMPLAIN\"In my conversations with Rick, he expressed this decision was grounded in his love for his family,\" Thibodeaux wrote.She added: \"While we appreciate Rick\u2019s service to the District, we are also saddened by the hurt and frustration recent events have caused.\"Slaughters attorney, Joseph R.

According to an affidavit filed by an FBI agent based in Tacoma, Slaughter and Gottfried first came to the agency\u2019s attention on Jan. 7, when they disrupted a flight from Washington, D.C., to Seattle by refusing to wear masks and protesting the results of the presidential election.In an interview with agents, Slaughter acknowledged they were at the riot but denied seeing any crimes committed, saying, \"conservatives don\u2019t protest, they have jobs,\" the affidavit said.SERIAL KILLER HOAX?

Prosecutors say Tucker Weston, 34, and Jesse Watson, 33, are roommates in Lynnwood who traveled together to D.C. and who illegally entered the Capitol that day. Weston faces felony charges, including that he shoved police officers, while Watson is accused of misdemeanors.They made initial appearances in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Wednesday and were released pending futher hearings in D.C.

  "text": "Tucker: Jan. 6 was not a terrorist attack \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 host discusses the media\u2019s response to Jan. 6 on the eve of its one-year anniversary.Today is Jan. 5th \u2014 or as it will henceforth be known to all civilized peoples around the world, Jan. 6th Eve. Tonight at midnight, just hours from now, we will begin the first of many annual remembrances of the horrifying atrocities that took place exactly one year ago at the United States Capitol. How do you commemorate something like this \u2013 a history-changing event that\u2019s horrible to think about, yet so significant in the life of the country? Body counts are the traditional measure. When the nation was wracked by unimaginable loss in years past, that\u2019s how we remember it: 40,000 casualties at Gettysburg. 2,400 lost at Pearl Harbor. Nearly 3,000 Americans dead on 9/11. But this is a new time, a different age. Those antiquated metrics won\u2019t work as we observe a moment of silence for the fallen of January 6th. MEGHAN MCCAIN SAYS TREATING JAN. 6 LIKE PEARL HARBOR, 9/11 IS \u2018TOTALLY AND LOGICALLY INAPPROPRIATE\u2019On January 6th, there was\u2026 well, let\u2019s see, actually, there was just Ashli Babbitt. Ashli Babbit wasn\u2019t a Union soldier, or a deckhand on the Arizona, or even a heroic fireman rushing into a collapsing office tower. She was just a Trump voter. She was unarmed. She was shot to death without warning by a Capitol Hill police officer with a documented history of reckless behavior. Ashli Babbitt was the death toll on Jan. 6. But, honestly, so what? It\u2019s not really about the numbers, is it? It\u2019s not about how many people were killed on January 6th. In fact, the list of those who weren\u2019t killed that day is quite long. It includes all 535 members of Congress, as well as their staff and the entire press corps that covers them. None of them died. They\u2019re all still around. But, again, who cares? It\u2019s not about body counts.  Protesters at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 AP Photo/John Minchillo, FileIt\u2019s about feelings \u2014 how the survivors feel, especially the reporters who survived. The feelings of reporters in Washington matter a great deal in America. They certainly matter a lot more than how you feel at the moment. How you feel, as you\u2019ve probably realized by now, is totally irrelevant to anyone. No one cares. But the journalists of Capitol Hill? They do care. And they\u2019re upset. Many still haven\u2019t recovered from what they saw that day. As they lie down to sleep at night, the horrible images replay on a loop on the back their eyelids: The deafening thunder of cannon volleys. The smoke from the remorseless artillery fire, blotting out the sun. The screams of the mortally wounded calling out for their loved ones, echoing like some demonic soundtrack against the walls of the speaker\u2019s lobby. Hell in a very small place. TWO QUESTIONS FROM THE JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOTUnless you were there, you cannot possibly understand what it was like. Imagine the Tet Offensive, plus Fallujah, plus the night before Thanksgiving at Whole Foods. On Jan. 6th, you couldn\u2019t tell who the enemy was, unless you looked down and saw they\u2019d bought their shoes at Walmart. Then you knew. But otherwise, it was the fog of war, my friends. Kasie Hunt was there that day. Hunt is now something called the \"chief national affairs analyst\" over at CNN. As a veteran of the siege of the Capitol, Hunt took to Twitter today to give hope to her fellow survivors. \"Tomorrow is going to be a tough one for those of us who were there or had loved ones in the building. Thinking of all of you and finding strength knowing I\u2019m not alone in this\u2026.#January6th\"That was just a tweet. But, someday, you\u2019ve got to believe, because this is a hopeful country, Hunt and her fellow survivors of the insurrection massacre of Jan. 6 will come together in some more formal way: Annual reunions, held in the shadow of Washington\u2019s certain-to-be-built Jan. 6 memorial, the one they\u2019ll have to bulldoze the Washington Monument to construct. Hunt and graying grizzled veterans of the Washington Post and Bloomberg News, and Politico, and The Daily Beast and the Atlantic Magazine will raise their White Claws as one, and remember how they cheated death that terrible day.JEFFREY TOOBIN ACCUSES GARLAND OF \u2018BOTHSIDERISM\u2019 DURIN GJAN. 6 ADDRESS: ITS \u2018ONLY\u2019 GOP DEFENDING THE RIOTERSOk, we\u2019ll stop. It\u2019s way too embarrassing. We\u2019re feeling shame even making fun of it. And in fact, as a political matter, the anniversary of Jan. 6th is not a joke. It\u2019s a very serious thing. Pretending that a protest was actually a failed coup is the Democratic Party\u2019s entire strategy to win this year\u2019s midterm elections. At this point, it\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. Governing didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s why today, the attorney general of the United States, one of the most political men in Washington, announced the department of justice will continue to harass and arrest people voted for Donald Trump.MERRICK GARLAND: The Justice Department remains committed to holding all Jan. 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law \u2014 whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy. We will follow the facts wherever they lead.AG MERRICK GARLAND SAYS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS \u2018NO HIGHER PRIORITY\u2019 THAN INVESTIGATING JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT\"Everyone who was responsible.\" The Department of Justice already had the largest manhunt in history. John Dillinger is laughing from the pit of hell. Jan. 6 trumped him, and it trumped the manhunt after 9/11. It trumps all manhunts. So people who were just standing there taking pictures on their phone got picked up by the FBI, some of them got sent to jail, but it\u2019s not ending, there\u2019s still more to come.  Protesters climb the west wall of the the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, FileBut of course, Merrick Garland never speaks alone. The chorus always joins him, because they always move as one. Frank Figliuzzi, for example, was a high FBI official who now working at NBC News, tweeted this prediction/observation: \"AG references Watergate. Get it? Merrick Garland pledges pursuit of Jan 6 suspects at any level.\" A former NBC executive named Mike Sington wrote, \"Don\u2019t give up hope, Trump could still be arrested.\"Arrested for what? I guess there wasn\u2019t room in the tweet to explain. But just arrested. Bad people should be arrested, that\u2019s the point. What\u2019s interesting is there are a lot of actual criminals who got no space in the Garland speech. VideoGarland made no mention at all of the \"pipe bomber\" of Jan. 5. \u2013 We\u2019re observing the anniversary of the pipe bomber right now. That individual was caught \u2013 we would say man but we don\u2019t want to get to specific in the current environment - on surveillance tape. He used his phone several times. That\u2019s all traceable. Where is that person? But Merrick Garland didnt mention it. Heres what he focused on instead:MERRICK GARLAND: We have received over 300,000 tips from ordinary citizens, who have been our indispensable partners in this effort. The FBI\u2019s website continues to post photos of persons in connection with the events of Jan. 6th, and we continue to seek the public\u2019s assistance in identifying those individuals.Be sure to check the FBI website. They\u2019re posting photos, and not of people who actually work for them who were there that day. They\u2019re not only posting photos, they\u2019re taking them off the site, including the most wanted list. Remember Ray Epps? He\u2019s on video several times encouraging crimes, riots, breaches of the Capitol on January 6th. He was on the FBI website. Now he\u2019s gone. Hasn\u2019t been charged with anything, apparently. Why is that? That\u2019s a real question. No one in Congress seems to care, even supposedly conservative Republican senators. JAN. 6 ANNIVERSARY SPEECH: BIDEN TO CALL OUT TRUMPS \u2018RESPONSIBILITYWhat are they busy doing? Well, they\u2019re busy repeating the talking points Merrick Garland has prepared for them. SEN. TED CRUZ: We are approaching a solemn anniversary this week and it is an anniversary of a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol, where we saw the women and men of law enforcement demonstrate incredible courage, incredible bravery, risked their lives to defend the men and women who serve in this Capitol.Let\u2019s be honest, everyone who\u2019s conservative appreciates Ted Cruz. You may not like him, but you\u2019ve got to appreciate him. He\u2019s legitimately smart, and he\u2019s one of the more articulate people to serve in Congress, maybe the most articulate. He doesn\u2019t use a single word by accident. Every word Ted Cruz uses is used intentionally, he\u2019s a lawyer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHe described Jan. 6 as a violent terrorist attack. Of all the things Jan. 6 was, it was definitely not a violent terrorist attack. It wasn\u2019t an insurrection. Was it a riot? Sure. It wasn\u2019t a violent terrorist attack. Sorry. So why are you telling us it was, Ted Cruz? And why are none of your Republican friends who are supposed to be representing us and all of the people who were arrested during this purge saying anything? What the hell is going on here? You\u2019re making us think the Republican Party is as useless as we suspected it was. That can\u2019t be true. Reassure us, please, Ted Cruz.

  "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines for June 22 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democratic colleagues on Tuesday that she is creating a new committee to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a person familiar with her remarks.Pelosi made the announcement at a private leadership meeting and did not give additional details. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private remarks.The new committee comes after Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would form a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the attack by former President Donald Trumps supporters. Pelosi said earlier this month that the House would step up investigations of the riot, in which a violent mob overran police, broke into the building and hunted for lawmakers to try to stop the certification of Joe Bidens election victory.The new select committee would put majority Democrats in charge of the investigation. More than three dozen Republicans in the House and seven Senate Republicans said they wanted to avoid a partisan probe, and they supported the legislation to form a commission, which would have been modeled after a similar panel that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks. VideoBut those numbers weren\u2019t strong enough to overcome GOP opposition in the Senate, where support from 1O Republicans is needed to pass most bills if all Democrats vote yes as a bloc. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said he may hold a second vote after the legislation failed to advance last month, but there\u2019s no indication that Democrats can win the necessary support from three additional Republicans.\"We can\u2019t wait any longer,\" Pelosi said June 15. \"We will proceed.\"Many Republicans have made clear that they want to move on from the Jan. 6 attack, brushing aside the many unanswered questions about the insurrection, including how the government and law enforcement missed intelligence leading up to the rioting and the role of Trump before and during the insurrection.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSome Republicans have gone so far as to downplay the violence, with one suggesting the rioters looked like tourists and another insisting that a woman, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the House chamber through a window was \"executed.\"Last week, 21 Republicans voted against giving medals of honor to Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police to thank them for their service that day. Dozens of those officers suffered injuries, including chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones.Seven people died during and after the rioting, including Babbitt, three other Trump supporters who died of medical emergencies and two police officers who died by suicide in the days that followed. A third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes."

Mastriano, a state senator, filed a complaint in federal court Thursday challenging the legality of the panels ability to compel witnesses to sit for depositions. \"Central to this issue is the fact that this committee lacks a ranking minority Member, or any members designated by the minority party,\" the suit reads. \"Although courts have previously held that, despite this defect, the committee has the power to issue subpoenas, no court has ever examined the issue of whether this particular committee is able to comply with the deposition regulations which explicitly require certain actions to be taken by the ranking minority member.\" Mastrianos lawyers assert that they are not questioning the legality of the committee or its ability to issue subpoenas. Rather they say that without a ranking Republican member, the committee cannot guarantee witnesses being deposed a fair hearing.DOJ SAYS JAN. 6 COMMITTEE PUBLICITY, TERM INSURRECTION FOR CAPITOL RIOT WONT DENY OATH KEEPERS FAIR TRIAL State Sen.

The Republican nominee provided documents and offered to take part in a voluntary interview, but the committee insisted on a videotaped deposition. \"Throughout the course of this investigation, Doug Mastriano has always been fully open, cooperative, and transparent with law enforcement, including the FBI,\" said Mastriano attorney Timothy C.
