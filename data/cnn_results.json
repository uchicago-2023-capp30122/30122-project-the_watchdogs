  "title": "McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to January 6 Capitol security footage, sources say",
  "date": "2023-02-22T02:15:06Z",
  "text": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has granted Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to all of the US Capitol security footage from January 6, multiple sources told CNN.  The highly unusual move -- a House speaker handing over a massive trove of internal government materials to a friendly media outlet -- comes after the California Republican faced significant pressure from his right flank to relitigate the work of the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. During his bid for the speakership, McCarthy vowed to hold hearings on the security failures that led to the Capitol getting overrun, and he told the select committee to preserve all of its records for potential future review by the newly empowered GOP majority. Carlson has been one of the most prominent promoters of January 6 conspiracy theories. Most notably, he has devoted significant airtime to the false claim that liberal \"deep state\" partisans within the FBI orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former President Donald Trump. He has conducted sympathetic interviews with some of the rioters who were subsequently charged by the Justice Department. Several GOP lawmakers within McCarthy's ranks had hoped to review the material themselves, likely to hunt for footage that supports their controversial claims about the January 6 insurrection. By giving the videos to Carlson, McCarthy is essentially outsourcing the task to right-wing media, at least for the moment. Axios was first to report McCarthy's arrangement with Carlson. US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger confirmed in a statement to CNN that Capitol Police gave McCarthy the security footage from the Capitol attack to be released to Carlson. \"When congressional leadership or congressional oversight committees ask for things like this, we must give it to them,\" Manger said in a statement. Capitol Police cannot comment further \"because we have to stay out of politics,\" a department official told CNN. A Fox News spokesperson told CNN that the Axios report was accurate, but declined further comment. Carlson told Axios, \"there was never any legitimate reason for this footage to remain secret\" and that the videos will shed light on \"what actually happened on January 6.\"  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the chamber's top Democrat, was not consulted about the release of the security footage, a source familiar told CNN. Another source told CNN that McCarthy didn't consult with his GOP leadership team before making the decision. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson only learned that McCarthy had granted Carlson access when the news became public, a source familiar with the timeline told CNN.  Manger, the Capitol Police chief, did not know that McCarthy was giving Carlson access to the footage until Monday, which was after the arrangement had been made, the source said. The source explained that McCarthy, or any member of Congress, could request access to the footage and that USCP would generally grant it. A separate source told CNN that if McCarthy asked the Capitol Police for the footage, he would not have to state why he wanted it in order to receive it.  The now-defunct January 6 committee got access to all the security footage from US Capitol Police during its investigation, but did not release certain clips for security reasons. A source familiar with the panel's work told CNN that the unreleased footage was considered especially sensitive because it showed the movements of top officials while they evacuated to safety. Separately, the House Committee on Administration made a request for the security footage, another source familiar told CNN. The panel, which was tasked with taking custody of all January 6 select committee documents, per House rules, requested the same access to the footage that the select committee had, the source said. Pushback to the move   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, issued a letter to his colleagues Tuesday vowing to get to the bottom of how McCarthy transferred footage of the attack to Carlson's team. \"The apparent transfer of video footage represents an egregious security breach that endangers the hardworking women and men of the United States Capitol Police, who valiantly defended our democracy with their lives at risk on that fateful day,\" Jeffries wrote in the letter.  Tim Mulvey, a former January 6 committee spokesman, blasted McCarthy's move in a statement to CNN, saying, \"It's hard to overstate the potential security risks if this material were used irresponsibly\" by Carlson or others. \"When the January 6th Select Committee obtained access to US Capitol Police video footage, it was treated with great sensitivity given concerns about the security of lawmakers, staff, and the Capitol complex,\" Mulvey said. \"Access was limited to members and a small handful of investigators and senior staff, and the public use of any footage was coordinated in advance with Capitol Police.\" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee and former chair of the January 6 committee, later added in a statement that McCarthy, if he \"indeed granted\" Carlson access, \"owes the American people an explanation of why he has done so and what steps he has taken to address the significant security concerns at stake.\" When asked at a press conference last month about how some Republicans previously urged former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to publicly release the full January 6 security footage, McCarthy signaled his support, saying, \"yeah, I think the public should see what happened.\" In the courtroom, federal prosecutors have long tried to keep certain CCTV clips from the Capitol complex hidden from the public, saying in court that their release poses a national security risk and could give vital insight to bad actors who may be planning a future attack. US Capitol Police share the same concerns. January 6 defendants have access to thousands of hours of unreleased footage from the attack, as well from an online database, but the videos are tightly controlled by a protective order and defendants are not allowed to publicly release the clips. \"Once the capabilities of a U.S. Capitol interior surveillance camera, including its position and whether it pans, tilts or zooms, is disclosed to the public via the release of a single video from that camera, the cat is out of the bag,\" Justice Department prosecutors wrote in a July 2021 court filing. After more than a dozen news outlets, including CNN, sued for access to the videos in 2021, the chief judge of DC federal court ruled that the public has a strong interest in seeing some security footage from the attack. However, these video releases haven't been automatic or guaranteed. News outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis. Former DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was attacked during the January 6 riot, called McCarthy's decision to give Carlson access to security footage from that day a \"dangerous choice.\" It \"guarantees that it will be selectively edited to fit an extreme MAGA narrative without care for the safety of Capitol police, members of Congress and congressional staff. Airing footage of restricted areas of the Capitol and sensitive evacuation protocols all while spreading misinformation about the nature of the attack on the Capitol endangers everyone working in the building,\" Fanone, who is now a CNN contributor, said in a statement to CNN. This story has been updated with additional information. "

  "date": "2023-02-08T08:31:29.648Z",
  "text": "Our live coverage of President Biden's State of the Union has ended, but if you want to read and see more of how the night unfolded, you can... Read\u00a0our fact checks\u00a0of the speech.\nCatch up on the biggest takeaways from the night.\nRead\u00a0about the GOP response from Arkansas Gov. Sarah\u00a0Huckabee\u00a0Sanders.\nGo through\u00a0Biden's full speech transcript\u00a0and an\u00a0annotated version.\nSee the State of the Union\u00a0in pictures.\nRead about this year's \"designated survivor.\" When President Joe Biden took to\u00a0the House Chamber on Tuesday for his annual State of the Union address, his message was one of unadulterated optimism \u2013 even in the face of open hostility. The spectacle of Biden smiling and offering a pointed riposte through multiple rounds of heckling from some House Republicans was, in many ways, an apt illustration of his presidency and a useful preview of his likely 2024 candidacy. A majority of Americans say he hasn\u2019t accomplished much, many Democrats aren\u2019t thrilled at the prospect of him running for reelection and he faces clear disdain from most Republicans. But Biden\u00a0powered through. Delivering what was widely viewed as a test run for his reelection announcement, Biden claimed credit for progress made during his first two years in office while stressing the job isn\u2019t finished. He faced sometimes-unruly Republicans, with whom he spiritedly sparred from the podium on spending cuts. The feisty display drew cheers inside the White House and offered the best preview to date of the energy Biden hopes to bring to the campaign trail soon. The speech\u00a0carried a strain of populism rooted\u00a0in strengthening the middle class \u2013 vintage Biden, but delivered at a pivotal moment for his political future. No president enters his State of the Union wanting to recite a laundry list of accomplishments and proposals, but \u2013 almost inevitably \u2013 the speech often veers in that direction. Biden\u2019s was no different, even as the president sought to tie everything together with a refrain of \u201cfinish the job\u201d \u2013 a phrase that appeared 12 times in his prepared text. Here are some of the key takeaways: Connecting with Americans: If there is one political conundrum Biden\u2019s advisers are urgently working to solve, it is why so many Americans seem to believe he has accomplished so little. By all accounts, Biden has passed large, historic pieces of legislation that could have transformational effects on the US economy. But polls show large majorities aren\u2019t feeling them. Biden hoped in his speech to bridge that gap, to demonstrate he cares about what Americans care about and to identify the problems he\u2019s looking to fix. \u201cSo many of you feel like you\u2019ve just been forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you, watching at home\u2026 You wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\u201d Bipartisanship: Working across the aisle was a theme throughout Biden\u2019s speech. He started the address by acknowledging Congressional leaders from both parties, saying he is looking forward to working with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.  \u201cMr. Speaker, I don\u2019t want to ruin your reputation but I look forward to working together,\u201d Biden said as he launched into his speech. He acknowledged that over the first years of his presidency, \u201cwe disagreed plenty.\u201d But he appealed to his political rivals for cooperation. \u201cTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together in this Congress as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President,\u201d the president added. China: The country was included in the text of Biden\u2019s speech well before a suspected spy balloon slipped into American airspace. But the incursion, which has generated a diplomatic backlash from China and drawn second-guessing from Republicans, lent new urgency to Biden\u2019s message about competing with Beijing. Biden and his aides believe steps to counter China are one of the rare areas where he could find bipartisan support. He saw some success on that front with the passage of a law boosting US semiconductor production last year. Spars with Republicans: For the first 45 minutes of Biden\u2019s address, that appeared to be the play for both sides. But when Biden began castigating Republicans for plans that would slash Social Security and Medicare, the decorum dropped. His accusations seemed to provoke Republicans, who lobbed accusations of \u201cliar\u201d from their seats in the chamber. As lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene interrupted Biden, McCarthy was silent \u2013 but his glare into the crowd spoke for itself. Later he found himself shushing his conference multiple times at outbursts interrupting the president. Republicans look to \"new generation\": The GOP\u2019s choice to deliver their response to Biden\u2019s speech, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is \u2013 at 40 years old \u2013 the nation\u2019s youngest governor. Half the president\u2019s age, her selection was a clear choice to contrast a different generation of leaders. While she cited her tenure as White House press secretary to Donald Trump, she did not rely heavily on her association with the former president. Instead, she appeared to call for a changing of the guard \u2013 an appeal for generational change that could apply as much to Democrats and Biden as it could to Republicans and Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation to lead. This is our moment. This is our opportunity,\u201d she said. Watch CNN White House reporter Maegan Vazquez break down the speech on TikTok. ##Catch Up## CNN tracked approximately how many minutes President Joe Biden spent talking about different topics during his second State of the Union address. Here is a breakdown of the time Biden spent on each:  ##Catch Up## President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address hit on themes of bipartisanship and economic reform. It was widely viewed as a test run for his reelection announcement. See photos from the speech: Arkansas' GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that after former President Donald Trump left office, President Joe Biden inherited a \u201cworld that was stable and at peace.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: It\u2019s obviously ridiculous to claim that there was world peace when Trump\u2019s tenure ended, and calling the world \u201cstable\u201d is\u00a0a subjective claim.\u00a0 When Trump left the White House in 2021, there were still plenty of wars ongoing around the world \u2014 albeit not as many as under previous presidents, and very few of those conflicts directly involved American armed forces. \u00a0 For instance, Trump did not end the war in Afghanistan, which was still ongoing when Biden took office. There were thousands of US troops in the country when Biden was sworn in, before he withdrew them all in 2021. \u00a0 The long-running Yemeni civil war was still happening when Trump left office. (Under Trump and Obama, the US supported Saudi Arabia\u2019s military intervention in the war through arms sales. Biden ended that policy in 2021.)\u00a0 The Syrian civil war was also ongoing, though at a more isolated level than in past years. And a\u00a0war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region was in full swing. The drug war in Mexico was still leading to deaths and disappearances.\u00a0 Additionally, the war in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region was still unresolved. The war began in 2014, but had settled into a \u201cfrozen conflict,\u201d with Russian proxies occupying a large chunk of the eastern Donbas region, and Ukrainian troops dug into trenches. It escalated into a full-blown war when Russia invaded in February 2022, after Biden had already taken office.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## In the official Republican rebuttal to the State of the Union,\u00a0Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00a0suggested the Biden administration and Democrats have largely called to defund the police.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAfter years of Democratic attacks on law enforcement, and calls to defund the police, violent criminals room free,\u201d she said. \u00a0 Facts First: While some Democrats have joined calls for a radical shift in police policy, including a reduction in police budgets, Biden and top congressional Democrats have not\u00a0supported and even rejected calls to \"defund the police.\"\u00a0 It's worth noting that the slogan \"defund the police\" means different things to different\u00a0activists\u00a0\u2014 from the dissolution of police forces to partial reductions in funding. \u00a0 That being said, Biden in particular has explicitly stated his opposition to abolishing or defunding the police several times.\u00a0 During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden told\u00a0CBS, \"No, I don't support defunding the police.\" Rather, he said, \"I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.\"\u00a0 Attacking Biden and Democrats on police funding is not a new tactic from Republicans. Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, several ads from Republican candidates attempted to create the inaccurate impression that the Democratic candidates they were targeting supported defunding the police. Some of the Republican ads simply made things up. Other ads falsely described bills the Democratic candidates have supported. Still other ads tried guilt by association, noting that the candidates have supporters who have called to defund the police but not mentioning that the candidates themselves rejected defunding the police. ##Fact Check##\u00a0 Both Republicans and Democrats sounded off after a tense address from President Biden that included heckling from Republican members, who called him a \u201cliar\u201d at some points during the speech. Democrat Rep. Mark Takano told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that the outbursts were \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the decline in decorum. I\u2019ve been in this Congress for 10 years, and that was uncalled for, the level of disrespect,\u201d he added, noting it was a \u201cnew low.\u201d \u201cThis cannot be normalized. It\u2019s troubling,\" he added. \u00a0 Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the heckling \u201cafter what we saw in the speaker\u2019s race,\u201d but praised President Biden for his handling of the situation. \u201cJoe Biden owned that room. No matter what they did, he responded with a twinkle in his eye,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used humor when appropriate, he pushed back, he showed strength. And so it didn\u2019t matter what they yelled at him, he won that night in a big way.\u201d Republican Rep. Mark Alford told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, \u201cI\u2019m not into calling names. I grew up with three brothers and I always knew that when you\u2019re calling names, you\u2019re losing the argument.\u201d \u201cI prefer personally to debate someone on intelligent thought and try to win them over through great argumentation. But I\u2019m not going to judge my fellow Republicans on their actions, so I\u2019ll leave that up to them,\" he said.  Republican Rep. Anthony\u00a0D\u2019Esposito\u00a0did not go so far as to call the president a liar, instead saying that \u201che was definitely misunderstood.\u201d \u201cI think that there were definitely some instances where he did not have the facts, and he didn\u2019t understand or wasn\u2019t sure of the facts, but the facts are what we said \u2013 people are not better off today than they were when he took office,\" he told CNN.  \u00a0 President Joe Biden said that \u201cfood inflation is coming down, not fast enough, but coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last six\u00a0months, while take-home pay has gone up.\u201d\u00a0 Facts first: Biden's claims are true if he was comparing year-over-year growth rates to each other, but not if he was measuring inflation itself.  Food prices were up 10.4% in December 2022 from the year-before period, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Food price inflation, as measured by the CPI, has slowly declined since hitting a 40-year high of 11.4% in August 2022. \u00a0 Overall inflation, as measured by the CPI, was 6.5% in December 2022. The headline inflation rate has declined for six consecutive months since hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. \u00a0 The CPI, which measures the average change in the prices over time of a basket of consumer goods, is one of several closely watched inflation barometers that also have showed price increases to have moderated in recent months. Within CPI and other indexes, there are various measures to gauge inflation. Most notably,\u00a0\u201ccore\u201d inflation measures that exclude items with more volatile price increases. \u00a0 Biden\u2019s claim that take-home pay has gone up is true if you start the calculation seven months ago; \u201creal\u201d wages, which take inflation into account, started rising in mid-2022 as inflation slowed.  However, real wages are lower today than they were both a full year ago and at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency in Jan. 2021. That\u2019s because inflation was so high in 2021 and the beginning of 2022.\u00a0\u00a0 There are various ways to measure real wages. Real average hourly earnings declined 1.7% between December 2021 and December 2022, while real average weekly earnings (which factors in the number of hours people worked) declined 3.1% over that period.\u00a0 \u00a0##Fact Check## A 72% majority of Americans who watched President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address had a positive reaction to the speech, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, with a smaller 34% reacting very positively. That pattern of broad but tempered enthusiasm is similar to the reception for Biden\u2019s speech last year. In 2022, 71% of speech-watchers reacted positively to his address, with 41% saying their reaction was very positive. Good marks from speech-watchers are typical for presidential addresses to Congress \u2013 in past years, most viewers reported positive reactions to third-year addresses from former presidents Donald Trump (76% positive), Barack Obama (84% positive) and George W. Bush (84% positive). The 34% who reacted very positively to Biden\u2019s speech is the lowest in CNN\u2019s speech reaction polls dating back to 1998. Biden\u2019s speech received a particularly warm reception from Democrats (62% had a very positive reaction), liberals (57% very positive) and older speech-watchers (52% very positive among those age 65 or older). Among those younger than 45, though, just 21% reported a very positive reaction, even as speech-watchers in this age group were just as likely as those age 65 or older to say that Biden\u2019s policies would move the country in the right direction (75% younger than 45 said so, as did 76% of those age 65 or older).\u00a0 State of the Union addresses rarely have major, lasting impact on presidents\u2019 approval numbers, particularly in recent years. But Biden\u2019s speech did bolster confidence in his policies among some who tuned in. Following the speech, 71% of speech watchers said they felt the policies Biden proposed would move the country in the right direction, versus 29% who said they would move things in the wrong direction. In a survey conducted before the speech, those same people were closer to evenly split (52% right direction, 47% wrong direction). The biggest movement came among those who were skeptical of Biden to begin with. Among those who said in the pre-speech survey that they disapproved of the way Biden is handling his presidency, just 7% said before the speech that they thought Biden\u2019s proposed policies would move the country in the right direction, rising to 45% post-speech. And among political independents, the share saying Biden\u2019s policies would move the country in the right direction rose from 40% pre-speech to 66% afterwards. Overall, 66% who watched the address said that Biden\u2019s policies would move the country in the right direction on the economy \u2013 that\u2019s in comparison to 62% of speech-watchers who said the same about his economic policies following his speech last year, and 72% following Biden\u2019s first presidential address to Congress in 2021. The share of viewers this year who felt Biden\u2019s economic policies would mark a shift in the right direction rose 16 percentage points following his speech. That shift was also heavily concentrated among independents, who went from 38% saying his economic proposals would move things in the right direction pre-speech to 64% post-speech.\u00a0 A two-thirds majority also said that Biden\u2019s policies would move the country in the right direction on foreign affairs (67%) with somewhat more modest majorities saying the same of his policies on gun laws (63%), government spending (59%) and immigration (55%). The share of viewers who said Biden\u2019s immigration policies would move the country in the right direction rose 14 points post-speech.\u00a0 Roughly half of Americans who tuned in for the speech, 52%, said that Biden\u2019s proposals struck the right balance ideologically, with 38% calling them too liberal and 11% not liberal enough. Most Biden disapprovers, 68%, called his proposals too liberal. About two-thirds of all speech watchers, 67%, said Biden did enough to address racial injustice in his speech, though that was notably lower among people of color (58% said he did enough) than among White speech watchers (72%). Majorities overall said he did not do enough to address the US relationship with China (59%) or inflation (55%).\u00a0 Slightly over 6 in 10 speech watchers, 62%, said they had at least some confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to provide real leadership for the country, with 28% expressing a lot of confidence. Another 38% said they had no real confidence. More on the poll: Surveys were conducted by text message with 552 US adults who said they watched the State of the Union on Tuesday, and are representative of the views of speech-watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the speech, and were selected by a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of speech-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points.\u00a0 Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who plans to announce her 2024 presidential campaign next week, criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s border and economic policies as he delivered his State of the Union address.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJoe Biden spin: My economic plan is working. Reality: Americans still can't afford groceries,\u201d she said in the first of\u00a015 tweets\u00a0posted during the speech.\u00a0 The former South Carolina governor then tweeted a video that included news coverage of the record inflation seen under the Biden administration and her commentary on Fox News saying inflation is \u201cthe number one issue that American families are talking about.\u201d\u00a0 She also focused her attacks on Biden\u2019s border policies and posted a separate video showing media coverage of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.\u00a0 \u201cJoe Biden spent two years refusing to tackle the border crisis he created. Mr. President, stop spinning and start doing your job,\u201d Haley tweeted.\u00a0 She also attacked Biden over his policies related to China, claimed Russia was \u201cemboldened\u201d because of Biden and argued schools shouldn\u2019t have closed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN's Jake Tapper that Republicans were \"protesting too much\" during President Joe Biden's State of the Union Address. \"I think they were protesting too much,\" she said about Republicans jeering at Biden when he mentioned during his speech that some Republicans considered making cuts to Medicare and Social Security to avoid hitting the debt ceiling.  \"They knew that they had been\u00a0identified as putting Medicare\u00a0and Social Security on the\u00a0table, and they were trying to\u00a0dismiss that, but the fact is,\u00a0it still is part of who they\u00a0are,\" Pelosi said. \"They never really supported it to\u00a0begin with.\" The former House speaker famously tore up her copy of former President Donald Trump's  2020 State of the Union speech while sitting directly behind him. The act of protest happened at the conclusion of Trump's address, which began with the former president refusing to shake Pelosi's hand. Watch Pelosi's comments on CNN:     President Biden said, \"We\u2019ve already created, with your help, 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\"\u00a0 Facts First: Biden's figures are correct; however, the \"good-paying\" qualifier is\u00a0subjective and can't be independently verified for each of those 800,000-plus positions.\u00a0\u00a0 The US economy added 803,000 manufacturing jobs from Biden's first full month in office, February 2021, through January 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The job growth rate during Biden\u2019s first two years in office was 6.58%. The last time a comparable growth rate was higher was in 1979.\u00a0 The average hourly wage in the manufacturing industry was $31.57 for all employees and $25.84 for production and non-supervisory positions in January, preliminary BLS data shows. Nationally, the average hourly wage was a projected $33.03.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## Former President Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0released a\u00a0video\u00a0message recorded before president\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address where he criticized\u00a0the current\u00a0administration\u00a0for inflation, the ongoing border crisis and rising crime rates.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s the real State of the Union,\" Trump opened.  He accused Biden's administration of \"waging war on free speech,\" \"leading us to the brink of World War III\" and weaponizing the Department of Justice. \u201cOn top of all of that, he's the most corrupt president in American history,\" he said. \"And it's not even close.\" At the end of his two-minute video, Trump reminded viewers that he intends to run for president \"to end the destruction of our country and to complete the unfinished business of making America great again.\u201d Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin strongly criticized the Republican representatives who heckled President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, saying it was \u201cawful, childish\" and \u201cdistasteful.\" \u201cNo matter who does that, it\u2019s just not acceptable, awful, childish, it\u2019s not who we are as a country,\u201d Manchin said. He also said he \u201chopes\u201d Speaker Kevin McCarthy \u201csays something about it.\u201d\u00a0 Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin also added it was \u201creally unbefitting.\u201d McCarthy didn\u2019t comment to CNN when asked about the heckling from Republicans. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise wouldn\u2019t criticize his members, instead calling on Biden to stop his rhetoric about a GOP push to cut entitlements. Some context: The yelling started when the president accused some Republicans of wanting to cut Social Security and\u00a0Medicare. The White House has repeatedly accused Republicans of wanting to make cuts to the programs, but McCarthy explicitly said recently that those cuts were off the table.\u00a0 Former vice president and potential 2024 presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Twitter that President Biden\u2019s State of the Union shows that it\u2019s \u201ctime for new Republican leadership\u201d to get back to the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s \u201cstrength and prosperity.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTonight\u2019s #SOTU showed one thing: That it is time for new Republican leadership to get our Nation back to the strength and prosperity we had under the Trump-Pence Administration,\u201d Pence wrote on Twitter. He then went on to list what he called \u201cBiden\u2019s failed leadership at home,\u201d noting high inflation and gas prices, and Biden\u2019s \u201cfailed leadership abroad,\u201d pointing to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the \u201cdisastrous\u201d Afghanistan withdrawal. Pence also argued that Biden\u2019s police reform bill \u201cwould be a disaster for law enforcement and the American people they serve. It would leave an under-equipped, underfunded, and demoralized police force even worse off,\" he said in another tweet. \u201cIf we want to improve policing in America, we can\u2019t kneecap police in America. That will only make police more afraid to do their job and more likely to make a bad decision in the moment,\u201d he added. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney recounted a heated interaction during State of the Union with GOP Rep. George Santos. Romney said he told Santos that he doesn\u2019t belong in Congress. He strongly criticized Santos for standing in the front aisle \u201ctrying to shake hands\u201d with President Joe Biden and senators \u201cgiven the fact that he's under ethics investigation.\u201d He also told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that \u201cyes\u201d he\u2019s disappointed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy hasn\u2019t called on Santos to resign.\u00a0 \u201cHe should be sitting in the back row and staying quiet instead of parading in front of the President and people coming into the room,\u201d Romney said, noting that Santos may have responded to his remark but he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear.\u201d Romney, a Republican from Utah, continued to blast Santos saying: \u201cHe says he, you know, that he embellished his record. Look, embellishing is saying you got an A when you got an A-. Lying is saying you graduated from a college that you didn't even attend and he shouldn't be in Congress. And they're gonna go through the process and hopefully get him out \u2026 But he shouldn't be there and if he had any shame at all, he wouldn't be there.\u201d Rep. Juan Ciscomani from Arizona delivered the Republican Spanish-language response to the State of the Union address and said the country is at a \"critical point\" in its history. Here is what he said in Spanish: \u201cHoy estamos en un punto cr\u00edtico en la historia de nuestra naci\u00f3n. Ahora, m\u00e1s que nunca, necesitamos luchar agresivamente por los valores que han hecho posible el sue\u00f1o americano para tantos. Pero como podemos ver, el presidente Biden y su administraci\u00f3n contin\u00faan impulsando pol\u00edticas que lastiman a nuestras familias.\u201d\nHere are his comments in English: \u201cWe are at a critical point in our nation's history. Now, more than ever, we need to fight for the values that made it possible for so many to live the American Dream. Unfortunately, President Biden and his administration continue to push policies that hurt our families.\" More on Ciscomani: When he was elected in November 2022, Ciscomani\u00a0became the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona. He was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The tradition of a Spanish-language response started in 2004. This year will be the first Spanish response to the address since 2020.\u00a0 Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00a0delivered the GOP response\u00a0in English. Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called for a new generation of GOP leadership in her party's response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday night. She pointed to the economy and inflation, seeking to draw a generational contrast with Biden. \"It is time for a new generation\u00a0of Republican leadership,\" Sanders said. \"At 40 I\u2019m the youngest governor in the country. At 80 he is the oldest president in American history,\" she added. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders criticized President Joe Biden's foreign policies in dealing with China and US border security.  \"The Biden administration\u00a0refuses to secure the border\u00a0and save American lives. And\u00a0after years of Democrat attacks on law enforcement and\u00a0calls to defund the police,\u00a0violent criminals roam free while law-abiding families\u00a0live in fear,\" she said Tuesday in the Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address.\u00a0 \"Beyond our border, from\u00a0Afghanistan to Ukraine, from\u00a0North Korea to Iran, President\u00a0Biden's weakness puts our nation\u00a0and the world at risk,\" she said. \"And the president's refusal\u00a0to stand up to China, our most formidable adversary, is\u00a0dangerous and unacceptable. \"President Biden is unwilling to\u00a0defend our border, defend our\u00a0skies and defend our people.\u00a0He is simply unfit to serve as\u00a0commander-in-chief,\" she added. In calling to revive the Democrats\u2019\u00a0enhancement of the child tax credit in 2021, President Biden pointed to the\u00a0fact\u00a0that the provision helped slash the child poverty rate that year.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s restore the full child tax credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Facts First: This is true. The child poverty rate was cut nearly in half in 2021, and the expanded child tax credit was the major factor. The enhancement accounted for the bulk of the reduction.\u00a0\u00a0 The child poverty rate fell from 9.7% in 2020 to 5.2% in 2021, according to the US Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which takes into account certain non-cash government assistance, tax credits and needed expenses.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s a reduction of 46%, sending the rate to the lowest level since the supplemental measure began in 2009.\u00a0 The child tax credit \u2013 both the traditional credit and the enhancement \u2013 reduced the child poverty rate from 9.2% to 5.2%, or 43%, according to the Census Bureau. Without the beefed-up credit, the rate would have only fallen from 9.2% to 8.1%, or 12%.\u00a0 As part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act that passed in March 2021, Congress enhanced the child tax credit for one year, beefing up payments to $3,600 for each child up to age 6 and $3,000 for each one ages 6 through 17, for lower- and middle-income families. For the first time, half the credit was paid in monthly installments from July through December, while parents could claim the other half when they filed their 2021 taxes this year.\u00a0 Also, more low-income parents became eligible for the full amount because lawmakers made it fully refundable.\u00a0 \u00a0##Fact Check## President Joe Biden called for an assault weapons ban during his State of the Union address.  Biden made an impassioned plea to renew the assault weapons ban as he recognized heroic efforts by Brandon Tsay, who disarmed the Monterey Park shooting suspect last month in California and was invited to attend the address.  \"Ban assault weapons now, once and for all. We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994. In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After we let it expire in a Republican administration, mass shootings tripled. Let's finish the job and ban these assault weapons,\" Biden said.  Watch his remarks on gun violence, below: \u00a0 While touting his efforts to stand up to authoritarian leaders in China and Russia, President Biden painted himself as a champion of freedom and inaccurately claimed that democracy was spreading under his watch. \u00a0 \u201cIn the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAutocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Facts First: This claim is at odds with data from Freedom House, a leading nonprofit that tracks democracy and human rights around the world. They say democracy has been in global decline over the past few years. \u00a0 The group\u2019s most recent annual report on the state of global democracy, released in February 2022, was aptly titled, \u201cThe Global Expansion of Authoritarian Rule.\u201d Their 2021 report was called, \u201cDemocracy under Siege.\u201d \u00a0 Getting into the data, Freedom House says 60 countries experienced democratic backsliding in the previous year, while only 25 countries improved their position. The group highlighted backsliding in Sudan, Nicaragua and Afghanistan, where the Taliban reclaimed power when Biden withdrew all American troops from the country. \u00a0 Freedom House\u2019s most recent report is one year old, with a new report likely coming out soon. And to be fair, Biden could merely be expressing his view that autocratic regimes have lost prestige on the world stage. \u00a0 But the trends appear to be holding. For instance, after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine last year, he initiated a domestic crackdown that rolled back the few remaining civil liberties that existed in Russia. \u00a0 Freedom House is largely funded by grants from the US government. \u00a0 ##Fact Check## Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders rebuked President Joe Biden's State of the Union address and agenda in her GOP response. \"Being a mom to three young children taught me not to believe every story I hear. So forgive me for not believing much of anything I heard tonight from President Biden,\" Sanders said.  She continued, \"From out of control inflation and violent crime to the dangerous border crisis and threat from China. Biden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it. And it is time for change.\" GOP Rep. Bob Good told CNN that he was one of the hecklers who called out President Joe Biden as a \u201cliar\u201d \u2014 and said Biden deserved it for his comments about Republicans saying they want cuts to Social Security and Medicare. \"The president gave a very dishonest speech, he didn't take responsibility for the harm that he's caused the country, and in particular he was lying tonight when he said Republicans are calling for cuts in Social Security and Medicare. He can't name the Republicans who are saying that ... because it's simply not true,\" Good said.  \"I think the greater offense is for the president to lie to the American people about something so important,\" Good said on the optics of Republicans heckling the president. Freshman Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, also defended his comments in the chamber. Ogles shouted \u201cit\u2019s your fault\u201d when Biden brought up fentanyl deaths. \u201cFor him to stand there with a straight face, and tell us that he has a solution when with a stroke of a pen he could have shut down the border \u2026 that offends me,\u201d Ogles said, linking fentanyl deaths to problems at the southern border. \u201cHe has not done a damn thing about it.\u201d\u00a0 Asked whether he thought it was appropriate to heckle Biden during his speech, Ogles said it was just a \u201cvisceral response\u201d and that a number of his GOP colleagues had also vocally pushed back on Biden. \u201cIt just so happened, as they were getting quiet, I got louder, so my timing, cadence might have been slightly off,\u201d he said. McCarthy, who had urged his Republican members to be mindful of their behavior during the speech, was seen trying to shush members during that moment in the chamber. Arkansas Gov.\u00a0Sarah Huckabee Sanders is now delivering the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. In a statement announcing that Sanders will give the response, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sanders was a representative for a new generation of Republicans. She gained national prominence when she served as White House press secretary under former\u00a0President Donald Trump, but she was no stranger to politics with her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, serving as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. Sanders worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father\u2019s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 White House bid.  She\u00a0made history last year\u00a0as the\u00a0first woman elected\u00a0as governor of Arkansas. Within 48 hours of being sworn in as governor, Sanders signed a flurry of executive orders, with one targeting critical race theory \u201cto prohibit indoctrination\u201d in schools and another\u00a0banning the use of the term \u201cLatinx\u201d\u00a0in official state documents. The\u00a0parents\u00a0of\u00a0Tyre\u00a0Nichols\u00a0received an\u00a0extended\u00a0standing\u00a0ovation\u00a0during the State\u00a0of\u00a0the Union address, marking an\u00a0emotional\u00a0moment\u00a0for police reform during the president\u2019s prime-time address.\u00a0 \u201cPublic safety depends\u00a0on\u00a0public trust. But too\u00a0often that trust is violated,\u201d Biden said. \u201cJoining us tonight are the\u00a0parents\u00a0of\u00a0Tyre\u00a0Nichols,\u00a0who had to bury him just last week.\u201d RowVaughn and Rodney Wells,\u00a0who came as first lady Jill Biden's guests, stood up and\u00a0received bipartisan applause. \u201cThere are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief\u00a0of\u00a0losing a child. But imagine\u00a0what it\u2019s like to lose a child at the hands\u00a0of\u00a0the law,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Biden sought to use his remarks to make the case for police reform, using the bully pulpit as his advisers said he would, to pressure Congress\u00a0into getting something passed though reform faces an uncertain\u00a0path. The president spoke\u00a0of\u00a0his own privilege\u00a0of\u00a0not needing to have \u201cthe talk,\u201d with his children, that \u201cso many Black and Brown families have had with their children. Bipartisan support for his remarks began building\u00a0when Biden touched\u00a0on\u00a0the shared values members have for public safety. \u201cJust as every cop\u00a0who pins\u00a0on\u00a0that badge\u00a0in\u00a0the morning has the right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there,\" he said, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joined\u00a0in\u00a0on\u00a0the applause. \u201cWhat happened to\u00a0Tyre\u00a0in\u00a0Memphis happens too\u00a0often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the real training they need,\u201d he said. \u201cHold\u00a0on\u00a0to higher standards. Help them succeed\u00a0in\u00a0keeping us safe.\u201d Biden\u00a0received another\u00a0standing\u00a0ovation\u00a0when he said, \u201ccops are good people.\" Nichols' parents stood up to applaud\u00a0when Biden said, \u201cwhen police\u00a0officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.\u201d A tear was visible\u00a0on\u00a0RowVaughn Wells\u2019 face. Biden erroneously called\u00a0Tyre\u00a0\u201cTyler,\u201d but called\u00a0on\u00a0Congress to commit themselves to making her words come true: \u201cSomething good must come from this.\u201d In a statement after the president's speech, the NAACP said Black Americans need \"more than words.\"  \"We demand action. Black America is grieving and continues to experience profound injustice at the hands of our nation\u2019s broken systems. Far too many Black people have lost their lives due to police violence and yet I cannot name a single law that has been passed to address this issue,\" wrote Derrick Johnson, NAACP President and CEO. \"While President Biden signed an executive order, we still need strong policies signed into law that will finally end the horrors of police brutality and hold officers accountable for their misconduct.\" ##Police Reform## Marjorie Taylor Greene repeatedly yelled back at President Joe Biden throughout the speech \u2014 on everything from his comments on fentanyl to entitlement cuts.  She yelled out \u201cliar\u201d at Biden over suggesting some Republicans wanted cuts to Medicare to Social Security. She also stayed seated when Biden introduced Tyre Nichols\u2019 parents and the Ukraine ambassador. White House officials are thrilled by the off-script back and forth between President Joe Biden and Republicans.\u00a0 \u201cCouldn\u2019t have written a better moment,\u201d one official said. More than the substantive back and forth, one official notes how it appeared to animate Biden in real time \u201cHe gets energy from his audience,\u201d the official said. It\u2019s not a new view on how Biden operates \u2014 his advisers constantly talk about how he finds his energy from engaging with people\u00a0 But to watch it happen during the speech, on the biggest prime-time stage of the year, was a moment White House officials are basking in right now. Some background: The president was speaking about the national debt \u2013 a debt he said took \u201c200 years to accumulate,\u201d but was increased by 25% under the last administration.\u00a0 \u201cThose are the facts, check it out,\u201d Biden said, as boos and chatter started in the chamber. \u201cCheck it out!\u201d he continued over the ruckus.\u00a0 Democrats cheered while Republicans quieted. But when the president accused some Republicans of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, the protests erupted again.\u00a0 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green appeared to stand and shout, \u201cyou lie.\u201d\u00a0 The White House has repeatedly accused Republicans of wanting to make cuts to Social Security and Medicare, but McCarthy explicitly said recently that those cuts were off the table.\u00a0 The president said he was \u201cglad to see\u201d the reaction, adding,\u00a0\u201cI enjoy conversion.\u201d People had doubts about President Joe Biden going into the State of the Union address and the president proved himself, according to CNN political commentator Van Jones. \"You saw him going back and forth in real time with some of the top politicians in the country and getting the best of them and being a unifier in doing it,\" Jones said Tuesday night.  He described Biden as \"strong-minded\" and relatable in the speech.  \"I thought Joe Biden did really well tonight relating to the American people and if you had doubts about him, look, he was as sharp tonight as he could be,\" he said. \"I thought he did a great job.\" But the most powerful aspect of Biden's speech, Jones said, was his ability to invoke reactions out of Democrats and Republicans.  \"He got both parties on their feet, not once but twice, on police reform,\" he said. \"The open wound on this country is police reform and Republicans and Democrats stood together twice to honor the family and also to honor policies that would make a difference. That was unexpected.\"  ##Analysis## President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address drew mixed reactions from the lawmakers in the room. Here are some scenes from the inside of the House Chamber:  We tracked the approximate length of President Joe Biden\u2019s second State of the Union speech. By CNN\u2019s tally, the president was about 15 minutes shy of Bill Clinton\u2019s 2000 address, the longest in recent history. Here is how Biden's address compares to past presidents:  ##Catch Up## President Joe Biden concluded his second State of the Union address with a message about the current state of the country.  \"So I've come to fulfill my constitution obligation to report the state of the union and here's my report: Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the state of the union is strong,\" Biden said to applause.  During the more than hourlong speech, Biden appealed to bipartisanship, telling Republicans he wants to work together instead of \u201cfighting for the sake of fighting.\" President Joe Biden addressed US-China relations following last week's incident involving  a suspected Chinese spy balloon \u2014\u00a0and he gave Beijing a warning.  \"Today, we are in the strongest\u00a0position in decades to compete\u00a0with China or anyone else in\u00a0the world \u2014\u00a0anyone else in the world.\u00a0And I am committed \u2014I am committed to work with\u00a0China where we can advance\u00a0American interests and benefit the world advance\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but make no mistake about it,\u00a0as we made clear last week, if\u00a0China threatens our sovereignty\u00a0we will act to protect our\u00a0country \u2014\u00a0and we did,\" the President said referencing how the US shot down the suspected spy balloon.  More background: US military fighter jets shot down the\u00a0suspected Chinese surveillance balloon\u00a0over the Atlantic Ocean off the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed Saturday. The operation ended a remarkable public drama that prompted a diplomatic fallout between Washington and Beijing, as the American public tracked the balloon\u00a0from Montana all the way to the Carolinas. Biden\u00a0approved the downing of the balloon, Austin said in a statement, which a US official previously told CNN was a plan that was presented and supported by US military leaders. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Kevin Liptak, Oren Liebermann and Phil Mattingly contributed reporting to this post.\u00a0 President Joe Biden reiterated his calls for Americans to bolster democracy and speak out against extremism, discussing how a recent politically motivated attack against Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \"never should have happened.\"  In the room where he was speaking, Biden recalled, democracy \"has been threatened and attacked, put at risk,\" when insurrectionists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Just a few months ago, Biden said, an assailant \"unleashed political violence\" in Pelosi's home, using \"the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on January 6th.\" The attack \"never should have happened,\" Biden said.  Pelosi, who was severely injured during the attack, sat above the House chamber as a guest in the first lady's box during the State of the Union.  \"We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America,\" the president continued, later adding that \"we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\" \"Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It's an American issue,\" Biden added.  President Biden claimed that a new law, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, will produce hundreds of thousands of new jobs. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investment in American manufacturing over the next few years.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Biden\u2019s prediction about future job creation is obviously beyond the scope of a fact check. But his claim about companies having announced $300 billion in manufacturing investments during his presidency is accurate; the White House provided CNN with a list of these publicly announced investments. (It\u2019s worth noting that companies sometimes end up investing less than they initially announce.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The majority of the manufacturing investments that have been publicly announced under Biden to date have been investments in semiconductor facilities. The Biden administration has emphasized the importance of US semiconductor manufacturing, and Biden signed a bill in August that has helped to generate major investment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0##Fact Check## President Joe Biden regained control of an increasingly rowdy House chamber \u2013 and even managed to quickly turn heckles into a standing ovation from most Republicans, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2013 during his State of the Union speech Tuesday night.\u00a0 The president was speaking about the national debt \u2013 a debt he said took \u201c200 years to accumulate,\u201d but was increased by 25% under the last administration.\u00a0 \u201cThose are the facts, check it out,\u201d Biden said, as boos and chatter started in the chamber. \u201cCheck it out!,\u201d he continued over the ruckus.\u00a0 \u201cHow did Congress respond to all that debt?\u201d Biden asked. \u201cThey did the right thing, they lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Democrats cheered while Republicans quieted. But when the president accused some Republicans of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, the protests erupted again.\u00a0 \u201cSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage, I get it, unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are,\u201d Biden said. \u201cInstead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I'm not saying it's a majority,\u201d he said to a rising chorus of boos.\u00a0 \"Anybody who doubts it, contact my office, I\u2019ll give you a copy of the proposal.\u201d\u00a0 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green appeared to stand and shout, \u201cyou lie.\u201d\u00a0 The White House has repeatedly accused Republicans of wanting to make cuts to Social Security and Medicare, but McCarthy explicitly said recently that those cuts were off the table.\u00a0 The president said he was \u201cglad to see\u201d the reaction, adding,\u00a0\u201cI enjoy conversion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a majority of you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even a significant \u2013 but it\u2019s being proposed by individuals. I\u2019m politely not naming them but it\u2019s being proposed by some of you,\u201d Biden said. Someone from the crowd shouted \u201cliar,\u201d among other heckles. McCarthy shook his head and appeared to shush his members.\u00a0 The president continued, saying he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cbe moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don\u2019t respond.\u201d \u201cFolks \u2013 as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right? They\u2019re not to be touched,\u201d he said, to what turned into claps. \u201cWe\u2019ve got unanimity!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s all agree, and apparently we are, let\u2019s stand up for seniors,\u201d he said, encouraging lawmakers to stand up. \u201cStand up and show them! We will not cut Social Security; we will not cut Medicare.\u201d\u00a0 He added: \u201cif anyone tries to cut Social Security \u2013 which apparently no one is going to do \u2013 I\u2019ll stop them. I\u2019ll veto it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cApparently it\u2019s not going to be a problem,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Biden then said when he brings his budget proposal to Congress, he wanted to \u201csit down together and discuss our mutual plans together. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d McCarthy stood and clapped. The new House Republican majority has constructed a figurative wall in front of President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative priorities. But White House officials made a point of including the most politically salient of them in his State of the Union address anyway. Junk fees. Non-compete agreements. Labor organizing. Paid family leave and an expanded Child Tax Credit. Expanding the cap on insulin prices to all Americans after enacting a cap for Medicare recipients last year. Each of these policies is viewed inside the White House as widely popular across the country. They have reams of polling data to prove it. They rally Democrats and elevate the party\u2019s close union allies. They also have little to no prospects of getting to Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law in the 118th Congress. But they mark a clear contrast for Biden to highlight, even as he seeks to underscore his desire to extend an olive branch of bipartisanship to his Republican counterparts. White House officials are well aware of the aspirational nature of the proposals. But they view the contrast as critical for the months ahead. There is, after all, another election coming up in 2024. And it won\u2019t just be lawmakers in the chamber up for reelection.\u00a0\u00a0 All signs point to Biden\u2019s name being on the ballot as well. President Joe Biden said there is \u201cnear record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Biden\u2019s claims are accurate.\u00a0\u00a0 The Black or African American unemployment rate was 5.4% in January 2023, just above the record low of 5.3% set in August 2019. (This data series goes back to 1972.) The rate was 9.2% in January 2021, the month Biden took office.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate was 4.5% in January 2023, not too far from the record low of 4.0% that was set in September 2019 \u2014 though the 4.5% rate in January 2023 was a jump from the 4.1% rate in December 2022. (This data series goes back to 1973.) The rate was 8.5% in January 2021.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## President Biden criticized the fiscal management of former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 saying that \u201cnearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by just one administration alone \u2013 the last one.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim is correct. The national debt, now more than $31 trillion, increased by just under $8 trillion during Trump\u2019s four years in office, in part because of Trump\u2019s major tax cuts. It\u2019s important to note, though, that some of the increase in the debt during the Trump era was because of the trillions in emergency Covid-19 pandemic relief spending that passed with bipartisan support. The national debt spiked in the first half of 2020 after increasing gradually during Trump\u2019s first three years in office, and because of spending required by safety-net programs that were created by previous presidents. A significant amount of spending under any president is the result of decisions made by their predecessors.\u00a0\u00a0 Charles Blahous, a researcher at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who authored the 2021 paper \u201cWhy We Have Federal Deficits,\u201d wrote that the impact of recent legislation on the long-term structural fiscal imbalance is\u00a0dwarfed by the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and increases to Social Security, all of which occurred between 1965 and 1972.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Despite all the political rhetoric expended today to cast blame for skyrocketing federal\u00a0deficits on either the Joseph R. Biden Jr. administration or the Donald J. Trump administration, on either congressional Democrats or congressional Republicans, the largest drivers of the structural federal fiscal imbalance were enacted roughly a half-century ago,\" Blahous wrote.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0##Fact Check## President Joe Biden emphasized the United States' support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion as the war approaches its one-year anniversary. \"Together, we did what America always does at our best,\" Biden said. \"We led. We united NATO. We built a global coalition. We stood against Putin\u2019s aggression. We stood with the Ukrainian people. Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.\" President Joe Biden is talking about the war in Ukraine during his State of the Union address \u2014\u00a0a cause the US has pledged more than $29 billion dollars since it began, according to the Pentagon.  Biden announced the latest package worth more than $2.17 billion Friday that includes longer-range missiles for the first time.  Last month, the US committed to provide Ukraine with 31 advanced M-1 Abrams tanks, a decision made in concert with European countries providing German-made Leopard 2 tanks. It was a reversal of a red line previously held by the US and other Western countries, like Germany. The tanks are powerful new tools, allowing Ukraine to go on the offensive and retake territory seized by Russia.  At the time of the announcement, Biden insisted the tanks should not be viewed by Moscow as an \u201coffensive threat.\u201d However, last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the West was threatening Moscow \u201cagain\u201d with German-made Leopard fighter tanks. One thing that still remains off the table for the US is fighter jets. Biden previously answered \"no,\" he would send jets to Ukraine. US and allied officials say jets would be impractical, both because they require considerable training and because Russia has extensive anti-aircraft systems that could easily shoot them down. All this comes as Kyiv has ramped up pressure on allies to send more aid and weapons \u2014 especially fighter jets \u2014 ahead of a possible Russian offensive in the spring. Even now, heavy fighting continues in eastern Ukraine, with Russian attacks often targeting civilian targets. CNN has reported that US and Western officials are urging Ukraine to shift its focus from the brutal, months-long fight in the eastern city of Bakhmut and prioritize instead a potential offensive in the south, using a different style of fighting that takes advantage of the\u00a0billions of dollars in new military hardware\u00a0recently committed by Western allies,\u00a0 One year of war: Biden is considering making a trip to Europe around the one-year anniversary of\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0next month, two senior administration officials tell CNN. One of the officials said that one stop under consideration is Poland, a key NATO ally currently housing thousands of American troops that also serves as a hub for Western weapons transfers to Ukraine. US service members are also training Ukrainian troops there.  It is highly unlikely that Biden would travel to Ukraine as part of this trip, however, one of the officials said, given the ongoing security concerns. As he walked into the chamber for the State of the Union address, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney told embattled GOP Rep. George Santos: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d according to a member who witnessed the tense exchange. The moment happened as members of Congress began entering the chamber for President Joe Biden's address.  President Joe Biden said Tuesday discussions of policing differ along racial lines in America, admitting he's never had to have \"the talk\" \u2013 how to conduct oneself around police   \u2013 that many Black and brown families have to have with their children.   \"If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don\u2019t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car,\" he said.  The mother of Tyre Nichols, the unarmed Black man killed by police in Memphis, was in attendance at the State of the Union address and told the president how she continues to find the courage to carry on and speak out, Biden said.  \"With faith in God, she said her son 'was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.' Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It\u2019s up to us, to all of us. We all want the same thing. Neighborhoods free of violence. Law enforcement who earn the community\u2019s trust. Just as every cop, when they pin on that badge in the morning has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there.  Our children have a right to come home safely,\" Biden said. The president added, \"Equal protection under\u00a0the\u00a0law\u00a0is a covenant we have with each\u00a0other in America.\u00a0We know police officers put their lives on\u00a0the\u00a0line every\u00a0single night and day and we\u00a0know we asked them in many\u00a0cases to do too much,\u00a0counselors, social workers,\u00a0cycle ecologists responding to\u00a0mental health crises and so much more,\u00a0in one sense we ask too much of\u00a0them.\" \"I know most cops and their\u00a0families are good, decent,\u00a0honorable people, the vast\u00a0majority,\" he said.  ##Police Reform## President Biden just recognized the mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, who are among the first lady\u2019s guests at the State of the Union address. They stood up during the speech and received a standing ovation.  Nichols\u2019 death days after being beaten by police in Memphis last month has renewed calls for police reform and reignited a national conversation on justice in policing. Biden hosted members of the Congressional Black Caucus at the White House last week to discuss police reform, which has stalled in Congress multiple times and faces an uncertain path forward. Nichols' parents have been among those calling for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to be passed to change policing on a federal level. But, Biden has a long way to go in term of police reform legislation, especially now with a divided Congress. The George Floyd Justice in Policing, originally introduced in 2020 and again in 2021, would set up a national registry of police misconduct to stop officers from evading consequences for their actions by moving to another jurisdiction. The bill twice cleared the House under Democratic control \u2013 in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 largely along party lines. But it never went anywhere in the Senate, even after Democrats won control in 2021, in part, because of disagreements about\u00a0qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being sued in civil court. What the president can do: After the bill failed, Biden signed\u00a0a more limited executive order\u00a0to overhaul policing on the second anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death. It took several actions that can be applied to federal officers, including efforts to ban chokeholds, expand the use of body-worn cameras and restrict no-knock warrants, among other things. But the president cannot mandate that local law enforcement adopt the measures in his order; the executive action lays out levers the federal government can use, such as federal grants and technical assistance, to incentivize local law enforcement to get on board. Now, the road for police reform has only become more challenging in the new Congress now that House Republicans, who have placed their priorities\u00a0elsewhere, are in the majority. Watch:  ##Police Reform## We're tracking the approximate length of President Joe Biden's remarks. Here's how it compares to the longest and shortest State of the Union addresses since 1964. So far he's doubled President Richard Nixon's 1972 address, which is the shortest in recent history. ##Catch Up## President Joe Biden zeroed in on the economy and infrastructure in the first 25 minutes. Here's how many minutes Biden spent talking about different topics during the first part of his State of the Union speech: ##Catch Up## President Joe Biden said that \u201cover the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start new businesses.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Facts First: This is true. There were about 5.4 million business applications in 2021, the highest number since 2005 (the first year for which the federal government released this data for a full year), and about 5.1 million business applications in 2022. Not every application turns into a real business, but the number of \u201chigh-propensity\u201d business applications \u2014 those deemed to have a high likelihood of turning into a business with a payroll \u2014 also hit a record in 2021 and saw its second-highest total in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump\u2019s last full year in office, 2020, also set a then-record for total and high-propensity applications. There are various reasons for the pandemic-era boom in entrepreneurship, which began after millions of Americans lost their jobs in early 2020. Among them: some newly unemployed workers seized the moment to start their own enterprises; Americans had extra money from stimulus bills signed by Trump and Biden; interest rates were particularly low until a series of rate hikes that began in the spring of 2022.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## For weeks the White House has claimed Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare.\u00a0 For weeks Republicans have said that\u2019s not true.\u00a0 House Speaker Kevin McCarthy explicitly said entitlement cuts or changes were not on the table in exchange for a debt ceiling increase. His colleagues agreed.\u00a0 But White House officials, keenly aware Republicans hadn\u2019t laid out their own plan, elevated the issue anyway.\u00a0 The conditions were set for a State of the Union clash \u2014 one Biden\u2019s advisers quietly hoped would come to fruition.\u00a0 Mission accomplished.\u00a0 Biden made a point of caveating his claim Republicans wanted to cut Medicare and Social Security, noting it only applied to \u201csome\u201d Republicans.\u00a0 But the Republican response was immediate \u2014 and fierce, with several, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, seen on camera yelling \"liar.\u201d\u00a0 Far from offended, Biden played along with the backlash.\u00a0 \u201cI tell you, I enjoy conversion,\u201d Biden said with a smirk as he veered away from his prepared remarks.\u00a0 \u201cSo folks, as we all\u00a0apparently agree, Social\u00a0Security, Medicare is off the\u00a0books now, right?...\u00a0Alright.\u00a0We got unanimity,\u201d Biden ad-libbed. Reflecting on the pandemic, and the country's recovery from the virus, President Joe Biden paused to remember the human toll of Covid-19. \"We will remember\u00a0the toll and pain that's never\u00a0going to go away. More than 1 million Americans\u00a0lost their lives to Covid,\" Biden said during his State of the Union address. \"Families grieving, children orphaned.\u00a0Empty chairs at the dining room\u00a0table constantly reminding you\u00a0that she used to sit there.\" Still, the president touted his administration's ability to re-open up the country. \"While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people and the ingenuity of medicine, we've broken the Covid grip on us,\" Biden said.  The administration has said it will end the public health emergency this spring, but the president said Congress still needs to \"remain vigilant\" and fund some efforts to \"monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.\" The mood shifted markedly in the room as President Joe Biden attacked the GOP over the debt ceiling standoff before singling out some unnamed Republicans, contending they are looking to slash and sunset Medicare and Social Security. \u201cLiar!\u201d at least Republican blurted out but it was unclear who yelled out at him. When Biden he said some Republicans want to end the programs after five years, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Troy Nehls jumped to their feet and yelled back, but it was unclear what they said. Many shook their heads no. It\u2019s been a tense mood since Biden has been touting all the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. As President Joe Biden\u2019s transformative legislative agenda looked all but dead, White House officials made a strategic decision to ditch its well-worn moniker: Build Back Better. It was banned inside the West Wing. Not a joke, as Biden himself might say.\u00a0 It worked. Maybe the correlation wasn\u2019t exactly a straight line, but Biden and his team resuscitated a scaled back version of the economic and climate proposals that served as the cornerstone of the proposal.\u00a0 Flash forward to Tuesday night, and Biden had a new frame for what that agenda created: \u201cWe\u2019re building back pride.\u201d\u00a0 At the heart of Biden\u2019s economic theory of the case is reconnecting communities hollowed out by decades of international trade and technology.  Industrial policy, once considered a pejorative, sits at the heart of many of major legislative wins. Rebuilding those communities \u2013 and reconnecting their residents to the pride in their individual hometowns \u2014 may seem trite or idealistic in its intent.\u00a0 Yet it\u2019s central to Biden\u2019s agenda and tonight, central to his State of the Union address. President Joe Biden has a series of go-to sayings that his advisers acknowledge people might not understand. Yet those sayings are an animating feature of his conversations privately \u2013 and every once in a while they make an appearance in a public setting. That\u2019s exactly what happened when Biden went off script as he described the push by some Republicans to undo his cornerstone economic and climate law known as the Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cAs my football coach used to say, \u2018Lots of luck in your senior year,\u201d Biden said veering off his prepared remarks with a grin. He translated the line a moment later. \u201cMake no mistake, if you try\u00a0anything to raise the cost, I\u00a0will veto it,\u201d Biden said, providing a reference point for the flashback to his high school football days. A shorter version of a saying he brings out every few months: \"Good luck, guys. You have no shot. Lots of luck in your senior year.\" \u00a0 President Joe Biden said, \u201cIn the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion \u2014 the largest deficit reduction in American history.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Biden\u2019s boast leaves out important context. It is true that the federal deficit fell by $1.7 trillion under Biden in the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, including a record $1.4 trillion drop in 2022 \u2014 but it is highly questionable how much credit Biden deserves for this reduction. Biden did not mention that the primary reason the deficit fell so substantially was that it had skyrocketed to a record high under then-President Donald Trump in 2020 because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when\u00a0the spending expired as planned. Independent analysts say Biden\u2019s own actions, including his laws and executive orders, have had the overall effect of adding to current and projected future deficits, not reducing those deficits.\u00a0 Dan White, senior director of economic research at Moody\u2019s Analytics \u2014 an economics firm whose assessments Biden has repeatedly cited during his presidency \u2014 told CNN\ufffd\ufffds Matt Egan in October: \u201cOn net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it.\u201d The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group, wrote in September that Biden\u2019s actions will add more than $4.8 trillion to deficits from 2021 through 2031, or $2.5 trillion if you don\u2019t count the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill of 2021.\u00a0 National Economic Council director Brian Deese wrote on the White House website in January that the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill \u201cfacilitated a strong economic recovery and enabled the responsible wind-down of emergency spending programs,\u201d thereby reducing the deficit; David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, told CNN in October that the Biden administration does deserve credit for the recovery that has pushed the deficit downward. And Deese correctly noted that Biden\u2019s signature legislation, last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, is expected to bring down deficits by more than $200 billion over the next decade.\u00a0 Still, the deficit-reducing impact of that one bill is expected to be swamped by the deficit-increasing impact of various additional bills and policies Biden has approved.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## Just moments after issuing a call to unity with Republicans to work together, President Biden called out members of the GOP who voted against the bipartisan infrastructure law when it was being considered by Congress.   After highlighting the progress that's been made to fund projects around the country through the infrastructure law, the president jabbed Republicans who voted against the bill but continue to ask to have their projects funded through the law's provisions.  \"I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law and my Republican friends who voted against it as well. But I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well,\" Biden said. \"But don't worry. I promised I'd be the president for all Americans. We\u2019ll fund these projects. And I\u2019ll see you at the ground-breaking.\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who opposed bill when he was minority leader and it was considered by the House, was sitting behind Biden during the State of the Union remarks.  President Joe Biden called for the passage of the \"Billionaire Minimum Income Tax\" during his State of the union address.  \"No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter,\" he said.  The tax would require households worth more than $100 million to pay at least $20 on their full income, including unrealized investment income.  Biden also said he proposes \"that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage longterm investments instead.\" \"They will still make a considerable profit,\" he added.  \"Look I'm a capitalist, but pay your fair share. A lot of you at home agree with me and many people know the tax system is not fair. It is not fair,\" Biden said to applause.  ##Economy## President Joe Biden called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling during his State of the Union address.  Biden made his case and said that his administration \"cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion \u2014\u00a0the largest deficit reduction in American history.\"  He highlighted that under the administration of Donald Trump, \"America\u2019s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.\" An eruption of boos ensued from some Republicans following Biden's remarks. Biden added, \"Nearly 25% of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone \u2014 the last one. They are the facts, check it out. Check it out. How did Congress respond to that debt? They did the right thing. They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis. They paid America\u2019s bills to prevent an economic disaster to our country.\"  \"So, Tonight, I\u2019m asking this Congress to follow suit. Let's commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned,\" the president said.  ##Economy## The US\u00a0hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January, forcing the Treasury Department to start taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills and escalating pressure on Capitol Hill to avoid a default later this year. The White House and the new House GOP majority have been at odds over how to resolve a way\u00a0to raise the debt limit. President Joe Biden and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy met last week to discuss a possible agreement. House Republicans continue to demand that lifting the borrowing cap be accompanied by spending cuts. In January, McCarthy rejected Democratic calls for a clean debt ceiling increase without any conditions attached, something he said he reiterated to the president during their meeting. The\u00a0White House has said\u00a0it will not negotiate or offer concessions and has pushed McCarthy to show the president his budget. Though the debt ceiling was originally designed to make it easier for the federal government to borrow, the limit has become a way for Congress to restrict the growth of borrowing \u2014 turning it into a political football in recent decades. What is the debt ceiling: Established by Congress, the debt ceiling is the maximum amount the federal government is able to borrow to finance obligations that lawmakers and presidents have already approved \u2013 since the government runs budget deficits and the revenue it collects is not sufficient. Increasing the cap does not authorize new spending commitments. The debt ceiling, which currently stands at $31.4 trillion, was created more than a century ago and has been modified\u00a0more than 100 times since World War II. What would happen if the US defaults on its debt: The Treasury Department said it expects extraordinary measures\u00a0to last until early June. Once these measures and cash on hand are exhausted, the debt ceiling crisis would start having very real impacts. If the government is no longer able to borrow, it would not have enough money to pay all its bills in full and on time \u2014 including interest on the national debt. So it would likely have to temporarily delay payments or default on some of its commitments, potentially affecting Social Security payments, veterans\u2019 benefits and federal employees\u2019 salaries, among others. ##Economy## President Joe Biden, touting progress against inflation, said: \u201cHere at home, gas prices are down $1.50 since their peak.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim is correct. He didn\u2019t mention, however, that gas prices are still significantly higher today than they were when he took office. And it\u2019s important to note that presidential policy has a limited impact on gas prices, which are determined by a complex global interplay of supply and demand factors.\u00a0 As of the day of the State of the Union, the national average for a gallon of regular gas was $3.457, per data from the AAA. That was indeed down more than $1.50 from a record high of $5.016 in mid-June. But it was still up from a national average of $2.393 on Biden\u2019s Inauguration Day in January 2021. Biden has taken steps to lower gas prices. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which contributed to a spike in gas prices, the Biden administration released 180 million barrels of oil from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The administration also issued an emergency waiver that allowed the sale of E15 gasoline, a blend that contains 15% ethanol, last summer. But as we regularly note \u2014 whether a president is boasting about a decline in gas prices or his critics are blasting him for an increase in gas prices \u2014 presidential policy is not a primary factor in the price of gasoline.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSimilar to why the primary reason for the rise in price isn\u2019t due to the president, the same holds true for declines,\u201d Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CNN in a message this week. \nAsked about the role of the president in the decline since the peak of mid-2022, De Haan said, \u201cWhile the president may have had a minimal role in lowering prices through easing regulation, and occasionally using waivers, the bulk of the decline is simply due to supply and demand changes, and Russian oil and refined products that are still being exported, providing needed supply to the global market.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 De Haan said Biden\u2019s releases of oil from the strategic reserve \u201cput some downward pressure on the price of oil, but I would not call it materially significant.\u201d\u00a0 ##Fact Check## During tonight's address, President Joe Biden announced a new standard that would require all construction material used in federal infrastructure projects be made in America.  \"Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cable. And on my watch, American roads, bridges, and American highways are going to be made with American products as well,\" Biden said.  Biden went on to directly speak to the American people, stating that his economic plan is about \"investing in places and people that have been forgotten ... Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind and treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you, watching from home.\" \"You remember the jobs that went away. You remember them don't you? The folks at home remember them. You wonder whether a path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without moving away. I get that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building an economy where no one's left behind,\" he said. \"Job's a coming back. Pride is coming back because choices we made in the last several years.\" President Joe Biden telegraphed his intent to highlight bipartisanship in his State of the Union address, but one key statistic is viewed inside the West Wing \u2013 and underappreciated.\u00a0 \u201cI signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President,\u201d Biden said near the start of his remarks as he highlighted a record of bipartisan wins.\u00a0 To be clear, many of those wins are on bills that fly under the news radar \u2013 or even the radar of many members of Congress. But in each, White House officials have sought to identify rank-and-file GOP member priorities and get them to Biden\u2019s desk.  Has it had an effect on the partisan warfare in Washington? Even White House officials acknowledge the answer is no.\u00a0 But do they matter to those individual members? And will those members remember that effort from the White House legislative affairs team in some future negotiation?  That\u2019s the long game bet.\u00a0 ##Analysis## It\u2019s not surprising that Republicans didn\u2019t give a rousing ovation for President Joe Biden when he entered the chamber, or when he praise Nancy Pelosi for her tenure as House Speaker \u2014 but they also had a mixed and tepid reaction for Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell when the president recognized McConnell for being the longest-serving party leader in Senate history. Many House Republicans remained seated \u2014 including hardliners like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The reason? Lingering frustration over his support for bipartisan bills in the last Congress \u2014 even as House Republicans largely opposed them. Also, McConnell\u2019s rock-bottom relationship with former President Donald Trump has eroded his standing in the MAGA-aligned House GOP Conference. Democracy remains \"unbroken\" despite hardships and challenges in the past two years, President Joe Biden said in his State of the Union address. \"Two years ago, democracy faced its greatest threat to the civil war, and today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken,\" he said, referring to the events of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The president also talked about the challenges that came with the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 schools and businesses were shut down, stunting the economy. He said the US was still able to overcome, touting his administration's job creation. President Joe Biden said in his State of the Union address that his administration has \"created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs \u2014 more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Biden\u2019s number is accurate: the US economy added 12.1 million jobs between Biden\u2019s first full month in office, February 2021, and January 2023. That number is indeed higher than the number of jobs added in any previous four-year presidential term. However, it\u2019s important to note that Biden took office in an unusual pandemic context that makes meaningful comparison to other periods very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0 Biden became president less than a year after the economy shed nearly 22 million jobs over two months, March and April 2020, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The jobs recovery then began immediately after that, under then-President Donald Trump, but there was still an unprecedented hole to fill when Biden took office.\u00a0\u00a0 Biden is free to argue that his stimulus legislation and other policies have helped the country gain jobs faster than it otherwise would have. (As always, it\u2019s debatable precisely how much credit the president deserves for job-creation.) Nonetheless, it is clear that there could only be such an extraordinary number of jobs added in 2021 and 2022 because there was such an extraordinary number of jobs lost in early 2020.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## We're tracking the approximate length of President Joe Biden's second State of the Union speech. Here's how it compares to the longest and shortest SOTU addresses since 1964. President Joe Biden started his State of the Union address Tuesday by congratulating new, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. This is the first time Biden is addressing a GOP-controlled House. \u201cMr. Speaker, I don't want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you,\u201d Biden said. McCarthy and Vice President Kamala Harris are seated behind Biden. The president also congratulated Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries as the first Black House Minority leader, as well as Sen. Mitch McConnell for being the longest-serving Senate leader. \"I want to give special recognition to someone who I think is going to be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,\" Biden added, which was met by cheers from Democrats as Pelosi blew the president a kiss from her seat in the chamber. Biden is expected to focus on bipartisanship throughout the address. President Biden issued a call to bipartisan call to unity during the opening remarks of the State of the Union address, telling Republicans in the House chamber that he's eager to continue working together in the new session of Congress.  Since taking office, Biden said, \"we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\" Together, he said, both parties came together to defend Europe, and passed a massive infrastructure bill as well as more than 300 other bipartisan pieces of legislation over the last two years.  \"To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well,\" the president said. \"You all are as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere. That\u2019s always been my vision of our country and I know its many of yours.\" President Joe Biden is now delivering his second State of the Union address at the US Capitol. The remarks come roughly at the halfway point of his term after Republicans regained control of the House chamber. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Vice President Kamala Harris are sitting directly behind the president. According to excerpts released ahead of the speech, Biden will tell congressional Republicans that he wants to work together instead of \u201cfighting for the sake of fighting\u201d and will reiterate his focus on middle class jobs. Biden is also expected to address concerns from Congress and the nation as his administration faces an uncertain economic picture, renewed calls for police reform, a war in Ukraine and escalating tensions with China \u2013 all while Democrats and the GOP\u00a0eye 2024 Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00a0will deliver\u00a0the Republican response to Biden\u2019s address.  President Joe Biden has entered the House chamber to deliver his second State of the Union address. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is the designated survivor while President Joe Biden delivers his State of the Union address.  Walsh is expected to depart the Biden administration soon after being offered a job heading the NHL\u2019s Players\u2019 Association. His departure wasn't expected to be announced until after Biden\u2019s address. What is the designated survivor? At least one top official is expected not to be in the US Capitol building during the president's speech, participating instead in an obscure ritual in order to maintain the line of presidential succession in the rare case that disaster strikes. That person is the designated survivor. Last year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was the designated survivor for Biden\u2019s first State of the Union address, staying away from the Capitol in an undisclosed and secure location during the president\u2019s prime-time remarks. How it started: According to\u00a0the National Constitution Center, the tradition of a designated survivor during the State of the Union speech began in the 1950s as a result of fears of a nuclear attack during the Cold War. But the federal government did not publicly name the designated survivor until 1981 when President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Education Secretary Terrel Bell assumed the designation for an address to a joint session of Congress. After the vice president, the speaker of the House, the Senate president pro tempore, and the secretaries of State, Treasury and Defense are next in the line of succession. Data analyzed by CNN shows that the attorney general, seventh in the line of succession, has been the highest-ranking Cabinet member known to have been appointed to be designated survivor. A Justice Department head has been selected for the role three times. While not as well known, the National Constitution Center states that designated survivors have also been used during inaugurations and presidential speeches to joint sessions of Congress. Members of Congress also have been designated to skip the State of the Union as a precautionary measure, according to the center. President Joe Biden is about to give his second State of the Union address. See photos of arrivals and other scenes from before the speech. A majority of the Supreme Court is in attendance at this year's State of the Union address.  Members of the court just walked into the chamber, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 which is her first time attending.  Members of the Supreme Court usually attend the State of the Union, though they do not play an official role.\u00a0Roberts has said in the past that he is not always content attending the event that is so geared around politics, but he is the only sitting justice to go to every address since joining the court in 2005. Over the years, some combination of justices have always crossed the street to attend the speech, but others have refrained either due to scheduling conflicts or the feeling that the event has devolved into what the late Justice Antonin Scalia referred to as a \u201cchildish spectacle.\u201d\u00a0 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor\u00a0are not in the chamber this year. The last time all nine sitting justices attended the speech was in 1977.\u00a0 CNN's Ethan Cohen and Melissa DePalo contributed reporting to this post.  President Joe Biden tweeted just moments before he's set to make his State of the Union address.  \"Two years ago, our country's economy was reeling,\" he said in a video posted to Twitter. \"COVID controlled our lives and our democracy faced one of its greatest threats. And folks, in the past two years, we've proven again that with every crisis our country always emerges stronger.\" See the president's tweet: Tyre Nichols' family has entered the House chamber just as the Memphis City Council voted unanimously to pass several public safety reforms in the first city council meeting since the release of the video of the beating of Nichols. The reforms included resolutions in support of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, as well as an ordinance for the Memphis Police Department to conduct an annual independent review of the police training academy and all training techniques. The family will be seated in First lady Jill Biden's box and President Joe Biden is expected to address police reform in his speech tonight.  CNN's Nick Valencia and Pamela Kirkland contributed reporting to this post. There is a lot of buzz in the House chamber and energy in the room as members take their seats and their guests fill up the upstairs gallery.\u00a0 It\u2019s a much different feel to the last few years when Covid-19 put a damper on the mood in the room. Also GOP Rep. George Santos is sitting currently in the center aisle where President Joe Biden will arrive and is chit-chatting with several conservative members of Congress.  He will be able to shake hands with Biden. Rep. Juan Ciscomani of Arizona will give the Spanish-language GOP response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. Here are some excerpts released from his remarks: \u201cHoy estamos en un punto cr\u00edtico en la historia de nuestra naci\u00f3n. Ahora, m\u00e1s que nunca, necesitamos luchar agresivamente por los valores que han hecho posible el sue\u00f1o americano para tantos. Pero como podemos ver, el presidente Biden y su administraci\u00f3n contin\u00faan impulsando pol\u00edticas que lastiman a nuestras familias.\u201d\nEnglish Excerpt:\n\u201cWe are at a critical point in our nation's history. Now, more than ever, we need to fight for the values that made it possible for so many to live the American Dream. Unfortunately, President Biden and his administration continue to push policies that hurt our families.\"\n[\u2026]\n\u201cNecesitamos un gobierno que rinde cuentas a sus ciudadanos. No uno con l\u00edderes que siempre tengan excusas y se enfoquen m\u00e1s en criticar al otro partido que en buscar soluciones reales. Podemos hacer mejor. Debemos hacer mejor.\u201d\nEnglish Excerpt:\n\u201cWe need a government that is accountable to its citizens. Not leaders with excuses and their focus on criticizing the other party than finding real solutions. We can do better. We must do better.\u201d\u00a0 He is also expected to talk about the American Dream. In 2022, he\u00a0became the first Latino Republican\u00a0elected to Congress from Arizona. He was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, and previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00a0was tapped to deliver the GOP response\u00a0in English. President Joe Biden spent most of Tuesday rehearsing his State of the Union address with senior aides, going over the lengthy remarks carefully in an effort to make his forthcoming delivery on Capitol Hill seamless.\u00a0 The rehearsal is not surprising \u2014 given this is Biden's style with any major address, putting in a significant amount of practice beforehand.\u00a0 But Biden has a clear goal tonight, a senior aide said, to make an appeal for more bipartisan progress while drawing a clear line between Democrats and Republicans on key economic issues.  His top White House aides believe this is shaping up to be the single biggest distinction with GOP lawmakers at this point in his presidency, and tonight is his chance to make it obvious.\u00a0 President Joe Biden has spoken repeatedly to advisers and allies over the last several weeks about his disdain for \u201climousine liberals.\u201d They are the upper class elites from big cities often identified as central to the Democratic coalition. In his State of the Union address, Biden will make an explicit call to those that have moved sharply away from Democrats in recent cycles \u2014 blue collar and rural voters that have seen jobs and industry\u2019s depart their home towns in recent decades, according to speech excerpts.  \u201cToo many people have been left behind or treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it,\" he is expected to say.  It\u2019s a constituency central to Biden\u2019s theory of the case \u2014\u00a0and a primary audience advisers say he\u2019s targeting not just with his speech tonight, but with his entire agenda.\u00a0 Vice President Kamala Harris has entered the House chambers and will be seated next to  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.  Harris shook McCarthy's hand before taking her seat. Both will be seated behind President Joe Biden during the State of the Union address.  President Biden has departed the White House and is headed to Capitol Hill to deliver his second State of the Union address.  Reporters asked Biden how he was feeing and he responded, \u201cGood.\u201d\u00a0 Asked \u201cwhat is the state of the union,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cGreat shape, getting better,\u201d as he entered the car.  Traveling with the president are the first lady and the second gentleman. Watch:  President Joe Biden is expected to return to themes of his 2020 campaign several times throughout his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Things like the \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation,\" an \u201ceconomy built from the bottom up and middle out,\u201d \u201crebuilding the backbone of America\u201d and \u201cuniting the country\u201d \u2013 all 2020 themes, all in tonight\u2019s speech, Democrats briefed on the matter told CNN.\u00a0 The reason, advisers said, is Biden\u2019s steadfast belief in the agenda he ran on. As one adviser pointedly added, it is also an agenda he \u201creceived 80 million votes for,\u201d making it the animating feature of his administration.\u00a0 It will appear that the president will rehash some of the same old lines, an adviser said, adding, \u201cBut this isn\u2019t about you. This is about connecting to the people outside of Washington.\" The themes are the core of a populist economic message designed to engage blue collar voters, a foreign policy based on steadfast and long-standing alliances and a political system where unity replaces a fabric that has for years been tearing at the seams. Biden\u2019s pitch will seek to attack his campaign themes to the progress made in his first two years and argue to Americans that he can \u201cfinish the job\u201d in the two \u2014 or six\u2014 years ahead. Final edits and tweaks to his second State of the Union address reveal that President Joe Biden is keenly aware of the need to overcome a disconnect with the public.\u00a0 In the final hours of preparations and edits to the president\u2019s remarks, there has been one constant focus \u2014 sharpening each section to best connect his policies with real people, according to advisers.\u00a0 It\u2019s a reality that underscores how aware White House officials are of a clear disconnect between their accomplishments and an American public that remains uneasy and dissatisfied.\u00a0 It\u2019s long been an almost obsessive behind-the-scenes issue for Biden. Aides tell stories of being sent out of meetings by an unsatisfied president to try explanations out on executive assistants and people on the street. There will not be a better moment to shift that view than tonight with tens of millions of viewers in prime time. As one adviser put it, \u201cThis is a night when people who don\u2019t otherwise pay attention to politics tune in. We can\u2019t miss that moment.\u201d The speech itself will be long \u2013 more than an hour without factoring in the applause and standing ovations from lawmakers \u2014\u00a0but the length underscores Biden\u2019s view that there is much he needs to tell the American people and this is the best moment to do just that. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she hopes to hear about the implementation of key legislation from president Joe Biden in his State of the Union address.  \"I hope to hear a really strong vision from the president about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" she told CNN's Dana Bash ahead of the president's address. She noted that \"there still is implementation\" and \"execution\" to be done on legislation passed like the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan. \"I'm really looking forward to hearing a lot of specificity around how we plan to implement legislation that we in Congress were successfully able to pass,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.  This will be her first time in the chamber where she is a member of the minority. Still, Ocasio-Cortez said she has an expectation that Biden will also mention some of the \"audacious plans on taxing the rich\" and \"stock buybacks\" in his address.  \"I think that these are really strong markers that are important for us to put down because they are, even though they are progressive, they're also overwhelmingly popular among independents, Democrats and even some Republicans as well,\" she said.  The congresswoman said she does believe some Republicans may be willing to work with the Biden administration.  \"I do believe that (Speaker) Kevin McCarthy has already demonstrated a struggle in keeping his caucus together, which again, all of that plays into potential openings in the next one to two years for Democrats to exploit.\" As for her, Ocasio-Cortez said she \"would enthusiastically support [Joe Biden] if he were the Democratic nominee.\" She said the American people will need to \"see what the plan is for our future\" from and potential presidential candidate. And should Biden make his case for second term in tonight's address, she said: \"I think we are going to have to hear a very forceful, big, animating, exciting vision.\" At the halfway point of his first term in office, one of the biggest questions facing President Joe Biden: Is America still listening? That is a central concern hanging over the White House, with even many loyal Democrats \u2014 including those who supported and still genuinely like Biden \u2014 unsure whether he is the best choice to lead the party and the nation.\u00a0 Spending the day talking to Democrats in battleground Wisconsin, a sense of strong admiration emerges, but also clear signs of trepidation about Biden\u2019s future. \u201cIt would be lovely if we could have somebody who\u2019s not in their 70s and 80s running for president,\" a woman who voted for Biden told CNN's Jeff Zeleny. It was a common sentiment. Never mind winning over his critics, tonight\u2019s address is designed to inspire \u2014 and re-energize \u2014 those who sent him to the White House in the first place. It\u2019s also intended to show that he has the vigor to run again \u2014 a challenge that is unique for Biden, the oldest president in American history. Democratic congressional leaders previewed President Joe Biden's State of the Union address during a roundtable Tuesday on Capitol Hill, predicting he will lean into\u00a0the narrative that Democrats can deliver and defend democracy while drawing a sharp contrast with House Republicans.\u00a0 \u201cThe contrast will be on full display,\u201d Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, while Sen. Chuck Schumer added that Biden shouldn't have to\u00a0respond to all the charges and investigations launched by the new GOP majority.\u00a0 While highlighting how the State of the Union is often one of the biggest television audiences a president can address, Schumer said Americans shouldn't expect a \"campaign rally-style speech,\" but instead a \u201cserious\" and focused one.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we communicate, we win,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 Pressed about\u00a0polls that show Americans don't feel the impact of Biden's agenda, the two Democrats argued that will change and predicted Biden's approval numbers will rise as legislation is implemented. Jeffries said it will take time\u00a0for people to feel the effects, likening it to Roosevelt's New Deal.\u00a0 On police reform: Both lawmakers acknowledged the difficult road ahead for legislation, though\u00a0Schumer and Jeffries expressed cautious optimism about police reform talks, noting that discussions between Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Tim Scott have started again.  Sen. Dick Durbin meanwhile is talking to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who they predicted could potentially be more open than his GOP colleagues have been. Schumer wouldn\u2019t say if qualified immunity, which has been a past sticking point, should be part of any deal, instead leaving that up to those doing the negotiating.\u00a0 The Biden administration told the Supreme Court Tuesday that its intent of letting the coronavirus public health emergency expire in May will moot the ongoing case over a Trump-era border restriction.\u00a0The filing came just hours before President Biden was set to deliver his second State of the Union address.  \u201cAbsent other relevant developments, the end of the public health emergency will (among other consequences) terminate the Title 42 orders and moot this case. The government has also recently announced its intent to adopt new Title 8 policies to address the situation at the border once the Title 42 orders end,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in a filing submitted to the high court. The Trump administration invoked Title 42 at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The public health authority allows border officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border in the name of Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0 Title 42 has been the subject of ongoing litigation.  Last year, Republican-led states, which had already filed suit in a separate court, requested to intervene in a case, arguing the program should be left in place.  The Supreme Court agreed to leave the program in effect and said it would hear arguments on March 1 on whether the GOP-led states can intervene.\u00a0The administration\u2019s brief was filed in advance of those scheduled arguments, which could potentially be impacted. \u201cThe anticipated end of the public health emergency on May 11, and the resulting expiration of the operative Title 42 order, would render this case moot: Because the Title 42 order would have \u2018expired by its own terms,\u2019 this suit seeking only prospective relief would 'no longer present' a \u2018live case or controversy,'\" the filing read.\n\u201cIn that event, the government will ask the court of appeals to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss private respondents\u2019 suit as moot,\u201d it read. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has privately told his members that the country will be watching their actions closely and he doesn't want a distracting gaffe to undermine their party's image with millions of Americans for the first time seeing their party in power, according to people who have spoken with him.\u00a0 Realizing that this is the first time many Americans will have tuned into the happenings on the House floor since his messy election to speaker, McCarthy is aiming to project a middle-of-the-road image for his party.  This has been a project for McCarthy for several cycles, attempting to recruit more ethnically diverse members for moments like this: To show the country that Republicans reflect America.\u00a0 McCarthy has told his members he will be acting responsibly when sitting behind Biden, applauding politely and repeatedly noting he won't replicate Nancy Pelosi's infamous 2020 moment when she tore up Donald Trump's speech.\u00a0 Republicans don't want a replay of 2009 when GOP Rep. Joe Wilson yelled out \"You Lie\" during former President Barack Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on health care.\u00a0 It's unclear if the hardliners will listen to him.\u00a0 GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was spotted in the Capitol carrying a white balloon \u2014 a symbol of the Chinese spy balloon that flew across the United States last week.  CNN has reached out to see if she will bring that balloon into the chamber \u2014\u00a0several Republicans are hoping she doesn't. \"Please no,\" one House Republican told CNN. White House officials view tonight\u2019s address as a primetime moment to lay out in detail a laundry list of accomplishments they view as transformative to the US economy.\u00a0 But they\u2019re also aware many still need to be implemented \u2014 and aren\u2019t being felt by the broader public.\u00a0 That\u2019s the driving force behind three words you\u2019ll hear several times in tonight\u2019s address, advisers say: \u201cFinish the job.\u201d As one adviser put it: \u201cHe wants to tell the country why the state of the union today is strong \u2014 but lay out his plans for an even better union a year or two from now.\u201d\u00a0 Of course, it\u2019s not lost on White House officials that in that time period, President Biden plans to be in the middle of a heated reelection battle.\u00a0Tonight marks a critical moment to lay that groundwork for what comes next.\u00a0 When President Joe Biden returns to the House chamber to deliver his second State of the Union address soon, the former longtime senator will be addressing his one-time congressional colleagues as a guest.  Two seats on the dais behind the president are reserved for the vice president and the House speaker. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is also the president of the Senate, will sit to the right behind Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be seated to his left. Presidents and first ladies typically invite about two dozen guests to sit in the House gallery. State of the Union guests help put a human face on a president\u2019s message for both policymakers and viewers at home. The president\u2019s Cabinet, Supreme Court justices who choose to attend, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, former members of Congress and members of the diplomatic corps are seated in front of lawmakers. House members aren\u2019t assigned seats. Instead, seats in the chamber are doled out on a first come, first served basis the day of the speech. House members must stay seated in the spot they choose until the address begins, according to the Congressional Research Service. Senators join their House colleagues in the chamber, sitting at the front, the report from the Congressional Research Service states. Here's at look at where everyone will be in the chamber: Multiple House members are bringing guests related to police reform to Tuesday's State of the Union address, using stories of police violence in their states to call for legislation. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a tweet Monday that she has invited the father of Amir Locke, a man killed by Minneapolis police serving\u00a0a no-knock warrant. She said in the a tweet that she is also planning to introduce reform legislation titled the Amir Locke End Deadly No-Knock Warrants Act. Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia also said on Twitter that he is joining other members of the Congressional Black Caucus to call for police reform. He invited Wayne Lynch, the father of Donovon Lynch, as his guest to the address, the tweet said.  Donovon Lynch died after he was shot in the torso and thigh by a Virginia Beach police officer in March 2021. Officers were responding to a series of shootings on\u00a0the night Lynch was shot. Biden is expected to address police reform in his speech and acknowledge some of the guests in the chamber. The president hosted members of the Congressional Black Caucus at the White House last week to discuss police reform, which has stalled in Congress multiple times and faces an uncertain path forward. The mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, are among the first lady\u2019s guests on Tuesday.\u00a0Nichols was killed last month by police in Memphis, Tennessee. The video of the deadly confrontation sparked protests across the country and prompted activists and Nichols' parents to call for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to be passed. CNN's Betsy Klein\u00a0and\u00a0Arlette Saenz contributed reporting to this post. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night. The speech will give Sanders a prominent national platform to speak to the country and counter Biden after the president highlights his priorities and agenda to the nation. In a statement ahead of the speech, Sanders previewed her message to the American public, saying, \u201cI am grateful for this opportunity to address the nation and contrast the GOP\u2019s optimistic vision for the future against the failures of President Biden and the Democrats.\u201d Sanders released the following excerpts from her speech:  \"In the radical left\u2019s America, Washington taxes you and lights your hard-earned money on fire, but you get crushed with high gas prices, empty grocery shelves, and our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race, but not to love one another or our great country.\u00a0\n\u00a0[\u2026]\n\u00a0\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day. Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn\u2019t start and never wanted to fight.\n\u00a0\"Every day, we are told that we must partake in their rituals, salute their flags, and worship their false idols\u2026all while big government colludes with Big Tech to strip away the most American thing there is\u2014your freedom of speech. \n\"That\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s crazy, and it\u2019s wrong.\n\u00a0[\u2026]\n\"Republicans believe in an America where strong families thrive in safe communities. Where jobs are abundant, and paychecks are rising. Where the freedom our veterans shed their blood to defend is the birthright of every man, woman, and child.\" This year\u2019s State of the Union will take place with Republicans newly in control of the House, a position of power the GOP is using to launch congressional oversight investigations aimed at the Biden administration. Sanders is expected to make the case that Republicans are now in positions to hold the Biden administration accountable, according to the governor\u2019s office. Sanders is expected to argue that Biden is not defending the border, not defending the skies, and not defending the people of America.  President Joe Biden's second State of the Union address is a national platform for the commander-in-chief to showcase the progress he's made on key policies and offer a glimpse into his vision for the future of the country.  Here are some key topics to watch:  China: Following the president's recent decision to have the military shoot down a Chinese surveillance balloon floating over the United States, Biden has an opportunity to spell out his approach to the American people. \nUkraine: The war in Ukraine is approaching its one-year anniversary. Expect Biden to call on Congress to continue providing Ukraine with consistent aid, even as many Republicans \u2014 now the majority in the House of Representatives \u2014 are unenthusiastic about giving as much aid as the federal government provided when Democrats were in charge. \nAreas to work together and red lines: The White House has said the president will use his speech to highlight areas where he can work together with Republicans. Biden will also draw lines in the sand, particularly when it comes to GOP proposals to cut entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. \nAcknowledging guests in the room: Paul Pelosi, the spouse of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was the victim of a politically motivated attack in his home, will be a guest of the first lady. Brandon Tsay, who disarmed a shooting suspect during\u00a0Lunar New Year celebrations in Monterey Park, California, is a guest of the first lady's as well. The mother and stepfather of Tyre\u00a0Nichols, a 29-year old unarmed Black man who was beaten by police in Memphis and died as a result of his injuries, will also attend. As Biden characterizes the state of the nation, expect him to acknowledge their stories. \nA campaign pitch: Throughout tonight's speech, expect Biden to use the platform as a soft launch for his likely 2024 reelection campaign. He'll talk about accomplishments from his first two years in office, progress made to achieve other policy goals and his pitch for the future of the country under his leadership.  In his first State of the Union address to a divided Congress, President Joe Biden will tell congressional Republicans that he wants to work together instead of \u201cfighting for the sake of fighting\u201d and will reiterate his focus on middle class jobs, according to excerpts of his remarks released by the White House Tuesday evening.  \u201cTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together in this new Congress,\u201d Biden is expected to say. \u201cThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere. And that\u2019s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America: the middle class, to unite the country. We\u2019ve been sent here to finish the job!\" As expected, Biden will also talk about his economic plan \u201cinvesting in places and people that have been forgotten,\u201d and \u201cbuilding an economy where no one is left behind.\u201d He will also address strong economic recovery since the pandemic. In his speech, Biden will seek to connect with his audience by saying he understands their plight. \"Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades too many people have been left behind or treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it,\" he will say. Read the full excerpts from his speech: \u00a0 \"The story of America is a story of progress and resilience\u2026We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it. That is what we are doing again. Two years ago our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs \u2013 more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\" _ \"My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades too many people have been left behind or treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away. And you\u00a0wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives. \u2014 \"To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together in this new Congress. The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere. And that\u2019s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America: the middle class, to unite the country. We\u2019ve been sent here to finish the job!\" Rahmat Mokhtar, a former Afghan interpreter who is advocating for the passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act, is among the various guests arriving in Washington, DC, to attend President Joe Biden\u2019s second State of the Union address. Mokhtar is a guest of Democratic Rep. Scott Peters, who\u00a0said on Twitter\u00a0on Monday that he is bringing Mokhtar to \u201camplify the need for Congress to pass [the Afghan Adjustment Act] now.\u201d\u00a0 Mokhtar worked with US Marines for roughly four years starting in 2010 and arrived in San Diego in 2016 under the Special Immigrant Visa program, he told CNN on Monday.  As an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, Mokhtar said it was difficult for him to find work in Afghanistan after graduating college \u2014\u00a0but the US military didn\u2019t care \u201cabout the inter-ethnic dynamics in Afghanistan,\u201d they just cared that he could do the job.\u00a0 More on the Afghan Adjustment Act: The act was heavily advocated for by\u00a0former senior military leaders\u00a0and service members alike, who were pushing for Congress to include the provision in the omnibus spending bill in December. It ultimately did not make it into the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing opportunity,\u201d Mohktar said of coming to the State of the Union address. \u201cAnd also I was overwhelmed with the heavy responsibility on my shoulders as an Afghan, as an American. When war happens, there are a lot of costs that people, ordinary citizens, [don\u2019t] realize. \u2026 This is a great opportunity to have this tough situation to briefly pitch to the people who are in power, and in control, and have influence, to really beg for their attention on this big issue.\u201d\u00a0 While Mokhtar said his original plan when he began working with the military wasn\u2019t to come to the US, life in Afghanistan began getting too dangerous for him because of his job. So despite still having family in Afghanistan and hope in his country, he came to the US on the SIV program and quickly made a life for himself.\u00a0 His wife joined him in San Diego just a few months later; the couple now has two boys, and Mokhtar said he became a US citizen just two months after the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. He has also started working with #AfghanEvac, a non-profit focused on fulfilling promises to Afghan allies.\u00a0 Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, called Mokhtar an \u201cabsolute patriot and American citizen\u201d who works daily to help other refugees. He met with officials at the White House and State Department on Tuesday, VanDiver said, to make a case with his own words about the Afghan Adjustment Act.\u00a0 \u201cHe is an absolutely incredible human being who gives so much of himself,\u201d VanDiver said. Speaking with CNN on Monday, Mokhtar said he had a clear message to Congress and the Biden administration: The time to take action is now. \u201cI am an Afghan who has been impacted by this,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not talking for any ideologies or any political party. This is a bipartisan issue \u2026 We still, I think, have some time to save the lives of thousands of Afghans that are fighting for survival in Afghanistan.\u201d This year Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be delivering the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.  The tradition of the opposing party response dates back to 1966.  The first official \"response\" to the State of the Union by the opposing party was delivered by Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen and Rep. Gerald Ford in 1966.  Each television network offered a half-hour slot for response time, although the slots were not \"roadblocked\" (i.e. did not air at the same time on all networks) and did not air immediately after the President's address.  In 1976, television time was available for the opposing party's response immediately following the State of the Union.  The choice of speaker usually rotates between the opposing party's House and Senate leadership, although on several occasions, party leaders have chosen multiple speakers.\u00a0 CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post.  State of the Union addresses are supposed to be a high mark of sorts for a president. The president has the nation\u2019s attention as he describes his accomplishments and agenda going forward.  And while President Joe Biden will certainly do those things Tuesday night, he faces a tall task. Biden\u2019s poll numbers (both in terms of his approval rating and his 2024 prospects) continue to be lackluster heading into the beginning of the 2024 primary season. Three polls were released in the\u00a0past five days\u00a0regarding how Americans view the job Biden is doing as president, and they all say basically the same negative thing.  Polls from ABC News/Washington Post, AP-NORC and CBS News/YouGov all have Biden\u2019s approval rating in the low to mid 40s and his disapproval rating in the mid to high 50s. The best polls that Biden has received (and that meet CNN\u2019s standards for publication) over the past few weeks still have Biden\u2019s disapproval rating above his approval rating. Indeed, Biden has sported a negative net approval (approve - disapprove) rating since the end of the summer of 2021, just months into his administration. That\u2019s nearly a year and a half in which more Americans have disliked than liked the job Biden has been doing as president. The only other president who had a negative net approval rating for that long during this early part of his presidency was Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump. The good piece of news for Biden is that his approval rating does not seem to be falling. Biden\u2019s approval rating\u00a0seemed to be on a steady upclimb\u00a0for much of December and into January. Then it dropped after classified documents were found at his Wilmington, Delaware, home and a Washington, DC, office he used after serving as vice president. It now looks to be up slightly, again. Further, Biden\u2019s base seems to be sticking with him. Almost every single poll has his approval rating with Democrats in the 80s. No president has ever faced\u00a0any real challenge for renomination\u00a0when his approval rating among his own party was above 75%. But there are other signs ahead of 2024 that are far from encouraging. Even as most Democrats like the job Biden is doing as president, they\u2019re not ready to commit to him being the party\u2019s standard bearer in the coming presidential cycle. Read more of Enten's analysis here.  Members of the Supreme Court usually attend the State of the Union address and sit in the House of Representatives chamber in the front-row, center.  Chief Justice John Roberts is the only sitting justice to attend every address since joining the court in 2005. Justices Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh had attended each address since they joined the court until 2021.  Roberts was the only justice invited that year due to pandemic capacity restrictions on attendance. That limitation also prevented Justice Amy Coney Barrett (who joined the court in 2020) from having the opportunity to attend her first presidential address to Congress. Retired Supreme Court Justice Breyer has attended the speech 24 times. He only missed four speeches since joining the court in 1994 (2000, 2019, 2020, 2021). He was the sole representative of the high court during the 2001, 2003 and 2004 addresses.\u00a0 The last time all nine sitting justices attended the speech was in 1977. Retired Justice John Paul Stevens attended seven of the first eight speeches after he joined the Supreme Court in 1975 but skipped every speech for the remainder of his 26 years on the bench. CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post. When President Biden delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, he\u2019ll speak in front of nearly every influential federal official in Washington \u2013 including members of Congress, top military brass, US Supreme Court justices and senior officials within his administration. But at least one top official is not expected to be in the US Capitol building for Biden\u2019s speech, participating instead in an obscure ritual in order to maintain the line of presidential succession in the rare case that disaster strikes. That person is the designated survivor. Last year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was the designated survivor for Biden\u2019s first State of the Union address, staying away from the Capitol in an undisclosed and secure location during the president\u2019s prime-time remarks. How it started: According to\u00a0the National Constitution Center, the tradition of a designated survivor during the State of the Union speech began in the 1950s as a result of fears of a nuclear attack during the Cold War. But the federal government did not publicly name the designated survivor until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Education Secretary Terrel Bell assumed the designation for an address to a joint session of Congress. After the vice president, the speaker of the House, the Senate president pro tempore, and the secretaries of State, Treasury and Defense are next in the line of succession. Data analyzed by CNN shows that the attorney general, seventh in the line of succession, has been the highest-ranking Cabinet member known to have been appointed to be designated survivor. A Justice Department head has been selected for the role three times. While not as well known, the National Constitution Center states that designated survivors have also been used during inaugurations and presidential speeches to joint sessions of Congress. Members of Congress also have been designated to skip the State of the Union as a precautionary measure, according to the center. Ahead of President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, House Speaker Kevin\u00a0McCarthy warned members during a closed-door meeting to\u00a0behave\u00a0themselves, reminding them that the \u201cmics are hot\u201d and the \u201ccameras are on,\" according to a source in the room.  House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik issued a similar warning. McCarthy\u00a0also told members to be cognizant that photographers can see their phones so be aware of what they are looking at on their screens \u2014 and be aware that boom mics can pick up their conversations, per source in room.  The source also said that\u00a0McCarthy\u00a0said he would not tear up Biden\u2019s speech as Rep. Nancy Pelosi did after one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. McCarthy also discussed and outlined the three main things he spoke to Biden about during his White House meeting last week including; that he\u2019s not willing to raise taxes, he won\u2019t pass a clean debt ceiling, and that Congress needs to spend less money, according to a person in the room. \u201cI was very clear to him: we\u2019re not going to raise taxes, we\u2019re not going to pass a clean debt ceiling,\u201d he said. \u201cI told the president we\u2019re going to spend less money, and we also care about policy as well.\u201d McCarthy\u00a0added that he saw Biden the next day at the national prayer breakfast, and the president remarked to him how good he thought their first meeting was. As you prepare to listen to President Joe Biden's address tonight, catch up on some notable State of the Union milestones and facts:  Former President Barack Obama is the only Black American in history to address a joint session or joint meeting of Congress. Over the years, several Black speakers from other countries have addressed a joint meeting of Congress. Among the notable examples are Nelson Mandela in 1990 and 1994 and Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2006.\u00a0\nAlthough former President Woodrow Wilson holds the record for most speeches delivered before Congress (26), former President Franklin Roosevelt holds the record for the most State of the Union/annual message addresses (12). Ten were delivered in person before a joint session of Congress; two submitted in written form to Congress, though he read one of them from the White House over the radio as a \"fireside chat.\"\nTwo presidents never delivered any type of State of the Union or annual message: William Henry Harrison and James Garfield. Harrison died after only 32 days in office; Garfield after only 199 days.\nThe first annual message broadcast nationally on radio was former President Calvin Coolidge's speech on Dec. 6, 1923. A year earlier, former President Warren Harding's annual message was broadcast on radio to a very limited audience, including Mrs. Harding, who listened from the White House while recovering from an illness. \nThe first televised State of the Union/annual message was delivered by former President Harry Truman on Jan. 6, 1947.\nThe first primetime State of the Union/annual message was delivered on Jan. 4, 1965. Former President Lyndon Johnson moved the speech from its traditional mid-day time slot to the evening to attract a larger television audience.\nThe first State of the Union/annual message to be streamed live on the Internet was former President George W. Bush's 2002 address.\u00a0\nThe first high-definition TV broadcast of the State of the Union/annual message was in 2004.\nThe first official postponement of a State of the Union/annual message occurred in 1986. Former President Ronald Reagan was scheduled to deliver his address on January 28, 1986, the same day as the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.\u00a0 CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post. US Capitol Police have been tracking social media posts about attacking the Capitol as the agency and other law enforcement around Washington\u00a0increase\u00a0security for Tuesday's State of the Union address.\u00a0 Among the security measures taken ahead of the address, authorities erected a non-scalable fence around the Capitol over the weekend \u2014 over the objection of the Republican House sergeant at arms \u2014  as security remains a political debate on Capitol Hill. Intelligence analysts still\u00a0believe the US remains in a heightened threat environment with possible violence directed toward lawmakers and law enforcement, according to a Capitol Police Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division bulletin circulated in recent days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Within the last month, elected officials, government buildings, and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States were targeted by violent actors,\" the bulletin said.\u00a0\u00a0 The bulletin also noted that calls on social media for violence targeted toward the Capitol remains prevalent.\u00a0\u00a0\"January 6 supporters perpetuate antagonistic commentary in social media platforms and several have called for aspirational targeting of the SOTU,\" the bulletin said.\u00a0\u00a0 Among the examples of concerning social media posts included a post comparing the Jan. 8, 2023,\u00a0insurrection in Brazil to the January 6, 2021,\u00a0insurrection at the US Capitol, and criticizing the Jan. 6 rioters for failing to \"finish it.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"This was the problem with J6. You can't do it halfway,\" the user posted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other posts speculated about the return of former President Donald Trump and called for the execution of\u00a0officials in\u00a0President Joe Biden's administration as well as\u00a0Biden\u2019s\u00a0arrest by the House Sergeant at Arms.\u00a0\u00a0 The bulletin also noted that increased scrutiny of police in the wake of incidents,\u00a0such as\u00a0the death of\u00a0Tyre Nichols,\u00a0could make the State of the Union a focal point for demonstrations.\u00a0\u00a0 The bulletin did point out there were no\u00a0specific\u00a0credible threats related to the\u00a0event.\u00a0\u00a0 The fence was erected after House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland voted last week against it, according to a source familiar with the Capitol Police Board vote. The other two members of the Capitol Police Board, Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson and Architect of the Capitol\u00a0J. Brett Blanton, voted for putting up the fence. McFarland, recently appointed by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, didn\u2019t think the fence was necessary\u00a0given a lack of intelligence suggesting a credible threat or large protests planned, the source said. Previous State of the Union addresses have been secured without a fence, the source added, and the cost \u201cto make the campus look like a military fortress was unnecessary.\u201d \u00a0Two years removed from the Jan. 6 riot, the Capitol Police Board is now split, with the Democratic appointed Senate Sergeant at Arms and the Republican House Sergeant at Arms. Blanton was appointed by former President Trump in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0 The political split will push different opinions about security onto the Capitol Police Board agenda, and the State of the Union presented the first test of the functioning of the new board.\u00a0 President Biden will deliver his second State of the Union address tonight. Here's a look at what we can expect,\u00a0according to someone who's been briefed on the speech: Expect democracy to come up: Biden will discuss the importance of a strong democracy and how it needs to be constantly defended. He'll say the country must remain united behind making sure American democracy remains strong.\nOne phrase you'll hear a lot: He'll use the phrase \"finish the job\" several times.\nBipartisanship will be a theme: He'll remind people (more than once) that he was elected to represent all of America \u2014 not red states or blue states. When he\u00a0talks about bipartisanship he'll make the point that Washington doesn't need to have conflict for the sake of conflict or power struggles for the sake of power struggles.\nHow he'll present economic issues: When he talks about deficit reduction, he'll link that to plans that would make wealthier Americans and businesses pay more, which is the billionaire tax. He'll argue the country can continue to invest without cutting Social Security and Medicare.\nConnecting to the middle class: The entire speech has a populist strain, going back to working for the middle class. The White House wants people to walk away from the speech believing Biden understands their issues, cares about what they care about and is actively working to make their lives better.\nA campaign theme coming back: He will return to the campaign theme of \"restoring the soul of the nation\" to argue for police reform, an assault weapons ban, and protecting abortion rights. The fallout over the decision to\u00a0shoot down\u00a0a suspected\u00a0Chinese surveillance balloon\u00a0over the Atlantic Ocean this weekend presents new logistical and diplomatic priorities for the United States. Politically, questions surrounding the balloon \u2013 should it have been shot down earlier? was it able to collect any intelligence? what should the US response be? \u2013 loom large over\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0as he prepares for his\u00a0State of the Union address\u00a0Tuesday evening. The response in Washington has unfolded predictably, with Republicans calling Biden\u2019s response delayed and Democrats rushing to defend\u00a0the White House\u2019s approach. House Republicans are\u00a0weighing the passage of a resolution condemning the Biden administration for its handling of the suspected surveillance balloon, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona. \u201cLetting a Chinese surveillance balloon lazily drift over America is like seeing a robber on your front porch and inviting him in, showing him where you keep your safe, where you keep your guns, where your children sleep at night, and then politely asking him to leave. It makes no sense,\u201d GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin told Fox News Sunday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the administration\u2019s decision to shoot the Chinese spy balloon on Saturday \u201ctoo late\u201d and said the US let China \u201cmake a mockery\u201d of US airspace. But Democrats aren\u2019t rolling over. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the GOP critiques \u201cpremature\u201d and \u201cpolitical.\u201d \u201cOur friends are playing politics with US intelligence. We sent a clear message to China that this is not acceptable. We protected civilians. We gained more intelligence while protecting our own sensitive information. And the bottom line here is shooting down the surveillance balloon over water wasn\u2019t just the safest option, but it was the one that maximized our intelligence payload,\u201d he said. A Gang of Eight briefing \u2013 with the top leaders in both chambers and key intelligence committee members \u2013 on the suspected Chinese spy balloon is expected to occur soon. Schumer also announced the full Senate would receive a comprehensive briefing on China. But this isn\u2019t the first Chinese surveillance balloon Congress has been briefed on. The Pentagon briefed Congress on previous balloons during the Trump administration that flew near Texas and Florida, GOP Rep. Michael Waltz said in a statement to CNN. The new details about previous balloons flying near Florida and Texas were confirmed by two additional sources familiar with the briefings, CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb and Zachary Cohen reported Sunday evening. But the transiting of those three suspected balloons during the previous administration was only discovered after Biden took office, a senior administration official told CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand on Sunday. The official said that the intelligence community is prepared to offer briefings to key Trump administration officials about the Chinese surveillance program, which the Biden administration believes has been deployed in countries across five continents over the last several years. Read more about the suspected Chinese balloon incident here.  President Joe Biden\u2019s economic message during the State of the Union address on Tuesday will focus on highlighting the progress made in improving the state of the economy while also contrasting his policies with the GOP proposals the White House sees as fiscally irresponsible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brian Deese, the outgoing director of the National Economic Council, outlined Biden\u2019s economic State of the Union themes, saying at the White House press briefing on Monday that the president \u201cwants this economic conversation to focus on how we can keep reducing costs for the American people,\u201d while contrasting that with Republicans \u201cdoing things like cutting taxes for the very wealthiest people in the country and increasing the deficit.\u201d\u00a0 Biden will \u201ctalk about progress\u201d made economically since he took office, underscoring that it\u2019s been \u201ca consistent vision since the campaign,\u201d Deese said.\u00a0 According to a White House fact sheet, Biden is expected to preview the budget he will send to Congress on March 9, \u201cwhich will build on the historic economic progress of the past two years by continuing to invest in America and its people, continuing to lower costs for families\u2014from child care to housing to college to health care \u2013 protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and reducing the deficit through additional reforms to ensure the wealthy and largest corporations pay their fair share.\u201d\u00a0 And during his speech, Biden will announce proposed guidance \u201cto ensure construction materials from copper and aluminum to fiber optic cable, lumber, and drywall, are made in America,\u201d the White House says. Biden is slated to acknowledge that more work needs to be done in order to continue making economic inroads and implement the landmark legislation signed into law during his first two years in office.\u00a0\u00a0 Biden will both hone in on areas of potential areas of bipartisan compromise and \u201cdraw some clear lines,\u201d Deese previewed. The American people will hear the president \u201coutline specific ideas\u201d on how to keep lowering costs for American families, including building on prescription drug reforms and lower the costs of child and elder care. And, when asked about his approach to the debt ceiling, Deese said Biden will express his \u201copenness and eagerness to have a conversation about the fiscal and economic priorities of the country and find common ground.\u201d\u00a0 The president is expected to acknowledge continued economic anxieties amongst Americans.\u00a0 Amid acknowledgements of continued concerns about the economy, Deese said he believes the country will \u201chear the president is optimistic about America\u2019s future because he believes in the American worker and the greater resilience of the American people.\u201d\u00a0 The longest State of the Union/annual message in terms of minutes was delivered by former President Bill Clinton in 2000. It clocked in at 1 hour, 28 minutes, 49 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara.  Clinton spoke before a joint session of Congress on nine occasions over the course of two terms. CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post. The tradition of the Spanish response to the president\u2019s annual address or State of the Union speech dates to 2004, when then-Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico rebutted George W. Bush on the impact the president\u2019s policies had on the Hispanic community and immigration in the US.  Since then, a Spanish response to the address has become almost standard. The years 2009, 2021 and 2022 are the only times since 2004 without a Spanish response. Republican party leaders announced that Rep. Juan Ciscomani will deliver the Spanish-language response to this year's address.  This year will be the first Spanish language response to the address since 2020. Previous responses: Florida GOP Rep. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart gave the first Republican Spanish response to a State of the Union address in 2010.  In 2013, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio became the first official to give both the English and Spanish response. He pre-taped the Spanish version before his live response in English.\u00a0 CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post.  President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address included a binder and a sweet treat.  The president posted a photo on Twitter Monday of a binder with what appeared to be a draft of the speech, alongside a plate of cookies and mugs with the Camp David seal. \"Getting ready,\" Biden tweeted alongside the photo.  CNN reported Biden was set to spend part of his weekend working on speech preparations, joined by presidential historian Jon Meacham.\u00a0 See Biden's tweet:  US Capitol Police ramped up security for the State of the Union, including a non-scalable fence addition around the Capitol grounds, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\u00a0\u00a0 Intelligence officials in the police department warned in an email circulated\u00a0to the force Friday\u00a0that the threat\u00a0level\u00a0remains elevated ahead of\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0State of the Union\u00a0address. While there are no specific credible threats to the event, the Capitol Police bulletin notes that \u201crecent incidents targeting politicians and law enforcement agencies within the past month indicate that there is a heightened threat toward government officials.\u201d\u00a0 Split opinions on security came into focus last month when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy removed the magnetometers leading to the House floor. The metal detectors, installed following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, were a sore spot for Republicans who felt they were a largely meaningless security measure.\u00a0 The issue bubbled up again last week. On Wednesday,\u202fmore than a dozen Democrats wrote to House and Senate leadership\u202fin attempt to raise alarm about security.\u00a0 \u201cWe write with urgent concern for the safety and security of the President, other dignitaries, and guests at the upcoming State of the Union Address,\u201d the Democrats said in the letter.\u00a0Citing the removal of the magnetometers and threats to lawmakers, they wrote that \u201cthe security of the House complex is today precarious.\u201d\u00a0 One law enforcement source said lawmakers will not undergo any additional screening before entering the House chamber\u202ffor Biden\u2019s address. Another source pointed out the magnetometers outside the House chamber were removed for the last two presidential addresses \u2013 the Joint Session in 2021 and State of the Union in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The State of the Union is\u202fconsidered a \u201cNational Special Security Event,\u201d\u202fa designation that puts the US Secret Service in charge of much of the planning and unlocks significant resources for security plans. Capitol Police control most of the security apparatus on the Capitol grounds in cooperation with the Secret Service and other agencies.\u00a0 Capitol Police declined to describe\u202fspecific\u202fsecurity plans.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor safety reasons, we cannot provide the public details about potential security measures or any potential resources that are put into protecting the Members of Congress,\u201d a\u202fdepartment\u202fspokesperson told CNN.\u00a0 The State of the Union is traditionally delivered in the chamber of the House of Representatives, before members of both the House and the Senate, as well as justices of the Supreme Court, members of the president's cabinet and the diplomatic corps.  This year\u2019s State of the Union will be the first since 2020 to have no Covid-19 precaution measures.  The arrival of the president is announced by the\u00a0House Sergeant\u00a0at\u00a0Arms (William McFarland). The speaker of the House (Rep. Kevin McCarthy) will then introduce the president. Traditionally, Senate and House Leadership escort the president into the chamber. This year, those members will be:  Senate:  Senate Majority Leader: Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) \nSenate Majority Whip: Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL)\nSenate Minority Leader: Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY)\nSenate Minority Whip: Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  House:  House Majority Leader: Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA)\nHouse Majority Whip: Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN)\u00a0\nHouse Minority Leader: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY)\u00a0\nHouse Minority Whip: Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA) Seated behind the president are the top members of each chamber of Congress: the president of the Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris) and the speaker of the House.  Note: If there is no vice president, or if the vice president does not attend, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate sits in the vice president's seat. CNN's Jake Tapper is getting ready for tonight. Check out the video below to see what he's looking for in Biden's speech: CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post.  A look back at public opinion following presidential addresses to Congress reveals two long-standing, seemingly contradictory trends. First, audience reactions to these speeches are almost unvaryingly positive. And second, it\u2019s increasingly rare for them to have a notable effect on the president\u2019s overall approval ratings.\u00a0 Much of this disconnect comes down to the viewership for these addresses, which tends to be highly unrepresentative of the full US public. People are more likely to tune in for politicians they already support than for those they oppose, meaning that Democratic presidents find themselves speaking to an audience that\u2019s disproportionately composed of Democrats, and vice versa for Republican presidents.  Last year, the viewing audience of Biden\u2019s speech was about 11 percentage points more Democratic than the public as a whole, CNN\u2019s polling found. That dynamic ensures a relatively friendly reception, but helps make it unlikelier that any single address will lead to a broader public reevaluation of the president who delivers it.\u00a0 Since 1998, CNN has gauged the public reaction to 21 State of the Union speeches and first-year presidential addresses to Congress. All were rated positively by most Americans who tuned in to watch, and most garnered a \u201cvery positive\u201d reaction from more than half of the viewing audience.\u00a0 Biden\u2019s two addresses to Congress so far both followed that pattern, receiving generally warm audience reviews \u2014 78% positive for his initial speech in 2021, and 71% positive for his State of the Union speech last year. Just 41%, however, viewed Biden\u2019s 2022 address\u00a0very\u00a0positively, tying with George W. Bush in 2007 for a low on that metric in CNN\u2019s reaction polls over the past 25 years.\u00a0 State of the Union speeches also tend to make at least a brief positive impact on audience assessments of presidential policies \u2013 in polls taken following the speech, viewers are more likely say that the president\u2019s proposed policies will move the country in the right direction than they were to say the same prior to the address. Following Biden\u2019s 2022 address, 67% of US adults who watched his speech said they believed his policies would move the country in the right direction, up from 52% among the same group prior to his address.\u00a0 Yet, across the speeches since 1952 for which polling is available, presidents' approval ratings changed by an average of roughly two-tenths of a percentage point post-speech, well within the margin of sampling error of a typical poll \u2013 and not always in a positive direction. Addresses after a president\u2019s inaugural year have been even less likely to produce any notable bounce. (Timing, of course, does not guarantee correlation -- any movement could be a result of the speeches, but could equally be a result of other events happening simultaneously.)\u00a0 Some past presidents have seen a shift in their ratings following an address to Congress. For instance, that happened to Bill Clinton, whose approval rose 10 percentage points following his 1998 speech. But that may be becoming increasingly uncommon. The most recent president to see a post-address approval rating shift of more than 3 percentage points was Barack Obama, following his initial speech to Congress in 2009.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither of Biden\u2019s previous speeches produced a noticeable effect on his approval rating overall. In both 2021 and 2022, his approval rating remained effectively stable, shifting by only 1 percentage point in the weeks following the address.\u00a0 Rep. Juan Ciscomani, who represents Arizona's 6th District, will deliver the Republican Spanish-language response to the State of the Union address, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced last week in a news release.  Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was tapped to deliver the GOP response in English.  In 2022, Ciscomani became the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona. He was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, and previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. \"My message will be simple and straightforward: the American Dream is a dream worth fighting for. The people of my district in Arizona and Americans across our country want accountability, responsibility and sensibility restored in our nation\u2019s capital,\" Ciscomani said in the statement announcing he would deliver the Spanish response.  McCarthy called Ciscomani \"inspirational.\" He said in the statement that he looks \"forward to hearing his response where I know he will share with viewers Republicans\u2019 Commitment to America to\u00a0empower\u00a0the\u00a0American\u00a0people\u00a0and hold\u00a0the\u00a0Biden administration accountable.\u201d President Biden will deliver his second State of the Union tonight at 9 p.m. ET, and his third address to a joint session of Congress.  Tuesday's address will be his first in front of a divided Congress, after Republicans won control of the House in November.  While all US presidents are constitutionally obligated to deliver an annual update on the state of the country to Congress, for most of American history they were delivered as written messages.  This will be the 106th time a president has delivered either address as an in-person speech before Congress. The US Constitution requires the president to brief Congress on the state of the union. Article II, Section 3, Constitution says:  \"He [the President] shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" Some historical background: The idea for a State of the Union address originated from a ritual from the British monarchy. The king or queen gives a speech from the throne at the opening session of the British Parliament.  The US State of the Union address used to be known as \"the President's Annual Message to Congress.\" Franklin Roosevelt titled his 1934 speech, \"Annual Message to Congress on the State of the Union,\" according to his papers.  According to the House Clerk's office, the speech was informally referred to as \"the State of the Union\" from 1942 to 1946. It was first officially called the \"State of the Union\" address in 1947 under Harry Truman.  George Washington delivered the first \"annual message\" on Jan. 8, 1790, at Federal Hall in New York.\u00a0 Washington and his successor, John Adams, both delivered their annual messages as speeches before Congress. Thomas Jefferson, the third president, discontinued this practice in 1801, saying the elaborate, formal ceremony (which included a \"president's throne\") too closely resembled a king addressing his subjects. Instead, Jefferson's private secretary carried the written message to Capitol Hill, and it was read to the chamber by the Clerk of the House. The practice of written annual messages continued for 112 years. President Woodrow Wilson resumed the practice of addressing Congress in person in 1913. Two presidents, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1945 and Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, sent written messages to Congress but also delivered radio addresses to the nation that summarized their congressional notes.\u00a0 See visual history of the State of the Union here:. CNN's Robert Yoon, Adam Levy and Liz Stark\u00a0contributed reporting to this post.  Arkansas Gov.\u00a0Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00a0will deliver the Republican response to\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0State of the Union address, according to an announcement from GOP congressional leaders last week.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced Thursday that Sanders will give the Republican address to the nation from Little Rock, Arkansas, after the conclusion of Biden\u2019s speech.  In a joint statement, McConnell and McCarthy both touted Sanders as a representative for a new generation of Republicans. Sanders expressed gratitude in the statement for the opportunity to give her party\u2019s response and \u201ccontrast the GOP\u2019s optimistic vision for the future against the failures of President Biden and the Democrats.\u201d \u201cWe are ready to begin a new chapter in the story of America \u2013 to be written by a new generation of leaders ready to defend our freedom against the radical left and expand access to quality education, jobs, and opportunity for all,\u201d she said. More about Huckabee Sanders: he gained national prominence when she served as White House press secretary under former\u00a0President Donald Trump, but she was no stranger to politics with her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, serving as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. Sanders worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father\u2019s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 White House bid. She\u00a0made history last year\u00a0as the\u00a0first woman elected\u00a0as governor of Arkansas. Within 48 hours of being sworn in as governor, Sanders signed a flurry of executive orders, with one targeting critical race theory \u201cto prohibit indoctrination\u201d in schools and another\u00a0banning the use of the term \u201cLatinx\u201d\u00a0in official state documents. Paul Pelosi, Tyre Nichols\u2019 parents, U2 star Bono, Monterey Park shooting hero Brandon Tsay, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova and a Holocaust survivor are among those headed to the US Capitol Tuesday evening where\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0is set to deliver his State of the Union address. Biden\u2019s remarks will both touch on\u00a0key themes of his presidency and offer a preview\u00a0of a 2024 reelection message. And the guest list for first lady Dr. Jill Biden\u2019s box offers a blueprint for what to expect. The first lady\u2019s 26 guests represent key administration priorities and accomplishments like infrastructure, mental health, climate and health care. They also represent issues the administration has confronted in the past year: support for Ukraine in the face of Russian invasion, antisemitism, the overdose epidemic, support for same-sex marriage, increased political polarization, mass shootings, a renewed national conversation on justice in policing and women\u2019s reproductive health. \u201cEach of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s policies at work for the American people,\u201d the office of the first lady said in a statement.

They also represent issues the administration has confronted in the past year: support for Ukraine in the face of Russian invasion, antisemitism, the overdose epidemic, support for same-sex marriage, increased political polarization, mass shootings, a renewed national conversation on justice in policing and women's reproductive health. \"Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration's policies at work for the American people,\" the office of the first lady said in a statement. Here are the guests and the stories they represent:  US support for Ukraine  Dr. Biden has invited Markarova as a guest for a second year in a row \"in recognition of sustained U.S. support for Ukraine,\" the White House said. Markarova received a standing ovation as she sat in the first lady's box during last year's State of the Union just days after Russia launched its war on Ukraine. The president is likely to highlight ongoing US assistance for Ukraine, including billions of dollars for both military and humanitarian aid.  Infrastructure There are multiple guests who have been impacted by the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021 that has begun to be implemented in recent months.  Saria Gwin-Maye is a union member of the Ironworkers Local 44 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and among those employed as a result of the bipartisan infrastructure act that the administration is working to implement with states and localities across the country. Gwin-Maye is working on the Brent Spence Bridge that has long been a chronic symbol of America's crumbling infrastructure. Biden traveled to the bridge alongside Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to highlight bipartisanship as the infrastructure law is set to invest more than $2 billion in the nation's bridges.  Deanna Branch, a Milwaukee mother who has worked to raise awareness about toxic lead pipes after her son suffered from lead poisoning due to unsafe levels in their drinking water and home, is also invited.  Job growth The first lady invited multiple guests who highlight job growth during the Biden administration, statistics the president frequently highlights as he makes an economic pitch to Americans, with last month's unemployment rate at a low 3.4%.  Biden is expected to highlight Maurice \"Dion\" Dykes who is training to become a teacher in Knoxville, Tennessee, through a registered apprenticeship program after spending more than two decades working in graphic design. Kate Foley, a 10th grader from Rolling Meadows, Illinois, will also be in attendance. Foley is studying computer-integrated manufacturing at a public high school that seeks to build career pathways for students through community college and local employer partnerships. The AIDS epidemic The first lady also invited a well-known celebrity with philanthropic ties: Irish rock legend Bono. The cofounder of the ONE campaign, Bono also worked to build support for the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. The Inflation Reduction Act The president is expected to highlight the sweeping climate and health care bill signed into law last August.  Fort Myers Beach, Florida, Chamber of Commerce President Jacki Liszak, owns a small business and met the president and first lady in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. Paired with the infrastructure law, the bill is working toward \"lowering energy costs and making communities like Fort Myers more resilient to extreme weather events through record funding to strengthen and weatherize our nation's power grid, roads, bridges, homes, public water systems and more,\" the White House said.  Combating extremism and political violence Biden has repeatedly sought to speak out against political violence, including a major speech on extremism and democracy one week before the midterm elections. Tuesday, the first lady is hosting former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul, who continues to recover from a politically motivated, violent attack at their California home. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for Nancy Pelosi and last fall, a male assailant attacked the then-speaker's husband with a hammer, shouting: \"Where's Nancy?\" -- a \"similar chant of those responsible for the January 6th Capitol insurrection,\" the White House said.  And the first lady has invited Monterey Park Lunar New Year shooting hero Brandon Tsay, the man who wrestled a gun from the California shooting suspect at Alhambra dance hall. Tsay, the White House said, \"is credited with preventing the gunman, who had killed 11 people and injured 10 others, from carrying out a second attack in Alhambra.\" The president previously called Tsay to thank him for his act of bravery.  Justice in policing The mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, are among the first lady's guests on Tuesday. Nichols' death days after being beaten by police in Memphis last month has renewed calls for police reform and reignited a national conversation on justice in policing. Biden hosted members of the Congressional Black Caucus at the White House last week to discuss police reform, which has stalled in Congress multiple times and faces an uncertain path forward. Women's reproductive health The president has taken multiple executive actions in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade and has forcefully spoken out against the decision. On Tuesday, Amanda and Josh Zurawski of Austin, Texas, will be in the first lady's box. Amanda Zurawski, the White House said, was unable to receive medical help when her water broke at 18 weeks pregnant because \"her doctors were unable to intervene to help her because they were concerned that providing the treatment she needed would violate the Texas abortion ban, which prohibits abortion care unless a woman's life is in danger.\" Zurawski, the White House said, \"developed sepsis and nearly died because of the delay in receiving treatment\" and \"continues to suffer from medical complications due to the delay.\" Combating antisemitism Second gentleman Doug Emhoff's special guest is Holocaust survivor Ruth Cohen of Rockville, Maryland. Cohen and her family were forced from their home during the Nazi regime. Cohen was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and was liberated in 1945, ultimately immigrating to the US three years later. Emhoff, the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, recently returned from a trip to Poland and Germany, where he marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day with a visit to Auschwitz and other key sites aimed at countering antisemitism. CHIPS and Science Act The president is also expected to herald the CHIPS and Science Act passed last year, a bill aimed at boosting domestic production of semiconductor chips. The first lady will host Paul Sarzoza of Phoenix, Arizona, the owner of a small facilities services company that services a major semiconductor manufacturing company, TSMC. TSMC is expanding in Phoenix due to the legislation and \"to keep up with the increased demand for his company's services, Sarzoza plans to hire 150-200 employees in the next year,\" the White House said, demonstrating the \"economic plan at work.\" Same-sex marriage Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill codifying protections for same-sex marriage, into law late last year. On Tuesday, same-sex marriage advocates Gina and Heidi Nortonsmith will be among the first lady's guests. The Nortonsmiths were plaintiffs in Goodridge vs. Department of Public Health, where Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court struck down a ban on same-sex marriage in the state.  Mental health Biden has outlined addressing the mental health crisis as a key aspect of his agenda.  Guest Harry Miller, a current senior and former football player at The Ohio State University, \"announced he would no longer continue to be a student-athlete to prioritize his mental health and has since become an advocate for mental health and emotional wellness,\" per the White House.  Cancer  The first lady has invited several guests who have been impacted by cancer, including breast cancer survivor Darlene Gaffney of North Charleston, South Carolina, who worked with a cancer support ministry at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church to help educate the community about early detection. Biden also invited Maurice and Kandice Barron of New York City, whose daughter Ava is in remission from a rare form of pediatric cancer. Maurice Barron wrote a letter to the president sharing their family's experience. Lynette Bonar, a registered member of the Navajo Nation and former sergeant and medic in the Army who worked as a registered nurse and executive at the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation, will also be in attendance. The first lady appeared with Bonar at the opening of the first cancer center on a Native American reservation in 2019. Addiction and the overdose epidemic Doug Griffin became a key advocate for American families battling addiction after his 20-year-old daughter Courtney overdosed on fentanyl. Griffin, the White House said, is \"raising awareness about the stigma associated with addiction, and calling for better access to substance use disorder treatment services.\" The president has put forth a National Drug Control Strategy aimed at \"(beating) the overdose epidemic.\" Supporting US troops  Other guests include a mother and daughter duo -- Kristin Christensen and Avarie Kollmar of Seattle, Washington -- who have worked with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to advocate for \"Hidden Helpers,\" military and veteran children in caregiving homes. Christensen became a caregiver to her husband after he medically retired from the Navy due to combat-related injuries. Immigration reform Mitzi Colin Lopez of West Chester, Pennsylvania, a Dreamer and immigration reform advocate who came to the US from Mexico when she was three years old, is among the guests. Biden has put forth his own immigration plan and has called repeatedly on lawmakers to find a bipartisan solution, but there is an uphill battle ahe"

  "title": "Opinion: Meta's big mistake on Trump",
  "date": "2023-01-28T17:26:25Z",
  "text": "On Wednesday, Meta justified its decision to restore Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts by claiming that the risk to public safety \"has sufficiently receded.\"    It's a statement that will come to haunt Meta executives \u2014 and one that ignores the growing body of evidence linking Trump's invective on social media to real-world political violence.   Earlier this month, a draft report from the House of Representatives' Jan. 6 select committee was leaked to the press. The 122-page document, \"Social Media & the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol,\" concludes that the risk former President Trump poses on social media \"has not abated.\"   Meta at one point agreed. When it first suspended Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, the company said that his posts about the insurrection \"contribute to, rather than diminish, the risk of ongoing violence.\" In upholding the decision, Facebook's Oversight Board later added that Trump's posts \u2014 especially those denying the election results \u2014 \"created an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible.\"    The company's decision to de-platform Trump and his allies appears to have had the desired effect. Following the former president's departure from mainstream social media sites, one comprehensive study found that online discussions about election disinformation declined by 73%.    The select committee's draft report found that Trump and his supporters used Facebook, among other social media platforms, to closely track \"his claims about a stolen election and subsequently his calls to descend on DC to protest the Joint Session of Congress on January 6th, 2021.\"    The draft report also condemned Facebook for its \"refusal to adequately police the spread of disinformation or violent content on Stop the Steal groups despite their known nexus to militia groups.\"   Since leaving office, Trump's views have become even more unhinged. He has continued to spread election lies on his own platform Truth Social. He has also boosted other conspiracy theories. Recent research by media watchdog group Media Matters for America finds that Trump amplified accounts that support the QAnon conspiracy 65 times during the 2022 midterms week, including 50 mentions on Nov. 14 and 15 just prior to announcing his 2024 presidential bid.   This track record should serve as a dire warning for Meta executives who think they can rein in Trump's erratic and dangerous behavior. Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said in a blog post on Wednesday that users \"should be able to hear what their politicians are saying \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly \u2014 so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box.\"    He also said the company has put in place \"new guardrails\" to prevent public figures who were suspended relating to civil unrest from continuing to violate its rules, including being subject to steeper penalties for repeat offenses and removal altogether for up to two years at a time.    Yet guardrails are nothing but a fresh public relations distraction unless they are actually enforced \u2014 and Meta, unfortunately, has in recent years failed to act against rule breakers, including those who repeatedly spread hate speech and certain disinformation, according to Free Press research released just before the 2022 midterms. And under its newsworthy content policy, it can carve out exceptions for the most powerful among us.    Indeed, Clegg wrote on Wednesday that under its newsworthy content policy, Meta may leave Trump's posts in place that violate its community standards, so long as the public interest in knowing about the statement outweighs any potential harm. It may then restrict distribution, leaving them visible only on Trump's page.    For content that does not violate its community standards, but \"contributes to the sort of risk that materialized on January 6,\" Meta may remove the \"reshare\" button, or stop them from running as ads or being recommended. But such efforts to switch off users' ability to amplify false content \u2014 such as \"stop the steal\" messaging, for instance \u2014aren't foolproof.    As CNN reported in 2021, pro-Trump groups simply altered their profiles, or changed the names of their groups, allowing them to continue to repurpose and spread Trump's 2020 election falsehoods while blending in with permitted Facebook activity.       Basic fairness would dictate that Trump play by the same rules as the rest of us. The patterns show us that violence doesn't just ignite overnight; the slow-burning embers of hate and lies that Trump has continued to stoke on Truth Social can incite another insurrection if they reach Meta's massive mainstream audience.    Yet Meta still has a chance to learn from its many mistakes, though that window is quickly closing. It can start by ending special exemptions for Trump and other prominent politicians who inflame hate, incite violence and spread anti-democratic lies.    Free Press, through our work with the Change the Terms coalition, has mapped a better path forward for Meta and other social media giants. This includes adopting and enforcing model policies to reduce hate and disinformation online and prevent actual violence in the real world.    No Meta user \u2014 no matter how powerful \u2014 should be allowed to use the company's services to engage in or facilitate hateful activities. The platform must ensure that toxic hate and disinformation are not present in any language or in any country where the company does business.   Meta executives bear full responsibility for any real-world harm that follows Wednesday's reckless decision. They can no longer claim ignorance about the political violence that can result when they allow access to an online megaphone to a dangerous figure like Trump."

  "title": "Jan. 6 Committee failed to hold social media companies to account for their role in the Capitol attack, staffers and witnesses say",
  "date": "2023-01-27T00:23:41Z",
  "text": "\"There might be someone getting shot tomorrow.\"  That was the warning from Twitter staff at an internal meeting on Jan. 5, 2021, the eve of the deadly attack on the US Capitol. It wasn't the only stark warning Twitter management received ahead of the insurrection, according to two former Twitter employees who spoke to the House Jan. 6 Committee.  But now these witnesses, along with some committee staff, are frustrated, saying the committee failed to adequately hold major social media companies to account for the role they played in the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years.   It was a \"real missed opportunity,\" Anika Collier Navaroli, a former Twitter employee turned whistleblower who gave evidence to the committee, told CNN in an interview last week. \"I risked a lot to come forward and speak to the committee and to share the truth about these momentous occasions in history,\" Navaroli said.   CNN spoke to half a dozen people who interacted with and were familiar with the Jan. 6 Committee's so-called \"purple team\" -- a group that included staff with expertise in extremism and online misinformation. Some witnesses and staff said the committee pulled its punches when it came to Big Tech, failing to include critical parts of the team's work in its final report. The discontent has poured into public view, with an unpublished draft of the team's findings leaked and obtained by multiple news organizations, including CNN.  One source familiar with the probe acknowledged that the committee obtained evidence that social media companies like Twitter largely ignored concerns that were raised internally prior to Jan. 6, but while those platforms should have done something at the time, the panel was limited in its ability to hold them accountable. A lawyer who worked on the committee said the panel did its job and focused on the unique and malign role of then-President Donald Trump in an unprecedented attack on American democracy. They also said the final report outlines structural issues across social media and society that need to be studied further.    Disagreement about social media companies' role in the Jan. 6 attack comes as 2023 looks to be a pivotal year for Silicon Valley firms in Washington, DC. Spurred in part by the release of Elon Musk's so-called \"Twitter Files,\" House Republicans are set to investigate purported Big Tech censorship, particularly as it pertains to social media companies' handling of a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden and his laptop. Facebook parent company Meta's high-stakes decision Wednesday to reinstate Trump on its platforms is also expected to stoke further scrutiny of tech companies' influence in elections. At the Supreme Court, justices are set to rule this year on a case that could strip key protections afforded to tech companies moderating online speech.  A missed opportunity  It isn't just Navaroli who has taken issue with the committee's findings. Three of the committee's own staff members, part of the so-called purple team, published an article earlier this month, sharply criticizing the decisions made by social media companies in the lead up to the attack.  The final report's \"emphasis on Trump meant important context was left on the cutting room floor,\" they wrote.  \"Indeed, the lack of an official Committee report chapter or appendix dedicated exclusively to these matters does not mean our investigation exonerated social media companies for their failure to confront violent rhetoric,\" they wrote.  In wake of the decision, CNN has reviewed thousands of pages of deposition transcripts and other supporting documents the committee has publicly released that provide insight into Silicon Valley's action and inaction in the critical period between Election Day 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021.  Navaroli, who worked on Twitter's safety policy team, told the committee she had repeatedly warned Twitter's leadership in the lead-up to Jan. 6 about the dangers of not cracking down on what she said was violent rhetoric.   Navaroli pointed to Trump's infamous \"stand back and stand by\" message to the Proud Boys at the first 2020 presidential debate as one instance that incited more violent rhetoric on Twitter.   Navaroli initially appeared before the committee as an anonymous whistleblower. Part of her testimony was played during the public committee hearings last summer, with her voice distorted to protect her identity. However, she later decided to go public, testifying before the committee for a second time, and speaking to The Washington Post.   In an interview with CNN, Navaroli said she is speaking out now because she believes it is important for the \"truth to be on the record.\" She warned that without a full reckoning of social media's role in the Capitol attack, political violence could once again ignite in the United States and elsewhere around the world, pointing to recent unrest in Brazil where supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the country's top government offices.  A leak  The final report from the Jan. 6 Committee stated, \"Social media played a prominent role in amplifying erroneous claims of election fraud.\"  But a far more blistering assessment was laid out in an unpublished draft document prepared by committee staff that was obtained by several news organizations, including CNN. Its key findings included:  \"Social media platforms delayed response to the rise of far-right extremism\u2014and President Trump's incitement of his supporters\u2014helped to facilitate the attack on January 6th.\" \n\"Fear of reprisal and accusations of censorship from the political right compromised policy, process, and decision-making.\" \n\"Twitter failed to take actions that could have prevented the spread of incitement to violence after the election.\" \n\"Facebook did not fail to grapple with election delegitimization after the election so much as it did not even try.\"  Tech companies would broadly dispute these findings and have repeatedly said they are working to keep their platforms safe.   Twitter's previous management repeatedly outlined steps it said it was taking to crack down on hateful and violent rhetoric on its platform prior to Jan. 6, 2021, but stressed it didn't want to unnecessarily limit free expression. Under Musk's leadership, Twitter no longer has a responsive communications team, and the company did not respond to CNN's request for comment.   Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, pointed to an earlier statement from the company where it said it was cooperating with the committee.    Jacob Glick, an investigative counsel who conducted multiple depositions for the Jan. 6 Committee, including Navaroli's, told CNN he believes the committee did its job to show \"the American public the dangers posed by President Trump's multilayered attack on our democracy.\"  He said the lack of awareness he believes tech companies have shown about their role in the attack was \"stark.\"   \"I don't think social media companies recognize they were dealing with a sustained threat to American democracy,\" he said.  Glick, who now works at the Georgetown Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, said the purple team's report had not been fact-checked, contains some errors, and should not have been leaked.   Another source familiar with the committee's work told CNN, \"It couldn't be clearer that Trump was at the center of this plot to overturn the election. Not everything staff worked on could fit into this extensive report and hearings, including some who wanted their work to be the center of the investigation.\"   Culture wars and content moderation  How social media platforms write and enforce their rules has become a central and ongoing debate, raising the key question of what power the companies should wield when it comes to politicians like Trump.  While some, including Navaroli, insist Trump repeatedly broke social media platforms' rules by inciting violent rhetoric that should have resulted in his removal before Jan. 6, others including Musk and Twitter's previous management, argue that what politicians say should be made available to as many people as possible so they can be held to account.  Meta and Twitter have both reversed their bans on Trump. \"We're moving backwards and it's concerning to me,\" Navaroli said of the return of prominent election conspiracy theorists to major tech platforms. \"History has taught us what happens when political speech on social media companies is allowed to fester unchecked.\" "

  "title": "Brazil security failings on January 8 draw growing scrutiny",
  "date": "2023-01-17T20:33:25Z",
  "text": "A police sniper peeked out of a helicopter as it performed a low flyby just a few meters above the Ministries Promenade in Brasilia. He was one of hundreds of officers deployed to secure the enormous grass patch -- which sits in front of the Brazilian Senate and Congress and is surrounded by most of the country's ministries -- where protestors were expected to gather last week. Authorities took no chances ahead of the planned demonstration last Wednesday by supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro -- in stark contrast to the now-infamous January 8 insurrection, when Brasilia's security forces were outnumbered and even maybe unwilling to defend several government buildings against the ire of pro-Bolsonaro rioters. \"Today, the same security officers showed that the capital is safe,\" Ricardo Capelli, the caretaker head of security for Brasilia told CNN, as he oversaw the large security operation on the ground.  On January 8, hundreds of protesters broke into Brazil's Congress building, Supreme Court, and presidential palace, breaking windows, damaging priceless artwork and spraying profanity on walls in scenes reminiscent of the January 6th insurrection in the United States.  Security forces have since come under scrutiny not only for failing to stop protesters from advancing on the buildings, but, in some cases, for failing to react. Some pictures and video posted on social media paint the picture of a seemingly passive approach by law enforcement to the increasingly violent protestor presence on Sunday \u2014 and top Brazilian government officials have accused the military police and federal police of turning a blind eye. \"There were a lot of colluding agents. There were a lot of people from the Military Police colluding. A lot of people from the Armed Forces here were colluding,\" Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Lula told journalists in Brasilia last week. \"I am convinced that the door of the Planalto Palace was opened for these people to enter because there is no broken door. It means someone facilitated their entry here,\" he said. Federal District Security Chief Ricardo Capelli meanwhile says he believes that, even if some individual officers may have been negligent or cooperated with protesters, security forces as a whole were set up to fail by their then-commanders on January 8. \"What happened on the 8th, and [Wednesday's] operation clearly demonstrates that, was the absence of leadership,\" he say, referring to the fact that Anderson Torres, his predecessor, was travelling when the riots occurred.  \"[Torres] changed the core of the leadership, travelled and left the office without command, allowing the unacceptable actions of the 8th to take place,\" Capelli argued.  Torres, who denies any wrongdoing, was arrested over the weekend and faces a number of allegations related to the insurrection, including attempted coup and terrorist acts.  On Tuesday, dozens of military personnel were also dismissed from their positions at the Alvorada Palace, the official residency of the Brazilian President. No reason has been given publicly for their firing, but both Lula and first lady Rosangela da Silva have been publicly critical of the military police's conduct during the insurrection, accusing some of those tasked with guarding not just the Palace but the other attacked buildings of colluding with rioters. The military police and armed forces have declined CNN's request for comment and more than a week later have not publicly addressed the security operation on the day of the riots.   Former policeman and law enforcement researcher Cassio Thyone says it's difficult to say exactly what went wrong, but, from what he saw, some officers may have conducted themselves inappropriately.  \"I don't believe it was incompetence, maybe some negligence. It wasn't all of them but some police officers ended up thinking there was no risk of an invasion,\" Thyone said.  After more than 20 years with the Brasilia Civil police, Thyone is now a lecturer and researcher on public security, heading the law enforcement research NGO Brazilian Public Security Forum. He believes that political pressure could also have influenced the behavior of some officers.  \"We have to understand that as part of the process of the last four years we've had a big ideology influence inside our policy, an ideology from the right,\" he explained. \"I believe that, in some way, it has influenced some of the decisions they've made.\" A study carried out by his Brazilian Public Security Forum in 2022, found that police officers were generally \"more conservative\" group than the average of the Brazilian population. \"We've seen results that between 50% and 60% of the police force were Bolsonaro sympathizers,\" Thyone said.  A previous study by his Brazilian Public Forum in 2021 found that 38% of police officers interacted in pro-Bolsonaro digital environments, and 21% were involved in more radical groups where the possibility of overturning the election was publicly discussed.  Still, support for Bolsonaro does not mean support for political violence. Thyone's research shows that law enforcement officers still reject any kind of institutional rupture, he says. \"The fact they sympathise with Bolsonaro doesn't mean they are against democracy,\" Thyone explains. \"Because for police officers there's a mission, they'll have to comply [with the constitution] regardless of their personal convictions.\" For Capelli, who has been tasked with rooting out any acts of collusion between the January 8 rioters and Brasilia's security forces, personal politics are irrelevant to his investigation into what happened. \"Police officers have every right to make their political choice, that doesn't interest me, for me that's not important,\" he says. \"What is important is the respect for the constitution, it's that them, in exercising their public duty comply with and respect the constitution.\""

  "title": "Opinion: The terrible outcome if the fringe runs Congress",
  "date": "2023-01-07T15:39:11Z",
  "text": "If Republicans can finally agree on a speaker, the same GOP leaders who spread former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election -- and who have consistently downplayed the grave threat to the nation posed by the January 6, 2021 insurrection carried out in his name -- will take the reins of power in the House.    Whoever assumes the role will be the leader of what the last few days have shown is likely to be a fractious, even ungovernable, Republican caucus.    But they'll be getting no sympathy from me: This week marks two years since the most violent day of my law enforcement career, when I almost died defending the US Capitol from armed insurrectionists who tried to overthrow our government -- the same violent uprising that House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and many others in his party continue to downplay. The violent insurrectionists who attacked the Capitol two years ago, almost taking my life, ignored my pleas that I have kids.   Unfortunately, the nation faces as great a risk from political violence as ever, fueled by inflammatory speech and a refusal by many politicians on the right to acknowledge the ongoing spasms of extremism and conspiracy.    And the conspiracists have a sizable swath of the public on their side: Politically-motivated attacks are on the rise across the nation and millions of Americans now believe that the use of force would be justified to restore Trump to the presidency. It's important to reverse this dangerous trend.    McCarthy once told me that he couldn't control the \"fringe members\" of the party on January 6. But these members are no longer the fringe: they are on the cusp of taking control of the House, and will have unprecedented influence in the 118th Congress. Whoever takes over the top spot, House leadership has a duty to reject the dangerous rhetoric that has led, and will continue to lead, to political violence here at home.    The incoming GOP House leadership must find the backbone to condemn political violence and hateful rhetoric incited by members of their own party. And that starts with finally denouncing Trump, who remains to this day the Republican Party's de facto leader. The incoming Speaker and the House leadership must demand that members of their party never again amplify language or take actions that put the lives of their constituents, their peers or law enforcement at risk.    There has been no shortage of such reprehensible behavior in recent months, starting with McCarthy himself. As GOP leader, McCarthy once vehemently condemned then-President Trump for his role in ginning up the rioters who stormed the Capitol -- and then swallowed those words of condemnation several days later. He traveled to Mar-a-Lago -- presumably with one eye on the speaker's gavel he had coveted for so long -- pandering both to the defeated president and election deniers in his own caucus.   Since then, influential GOP House members have called the January 6 assault a \"normal tourist visit.\" Some have called  for former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's execution for treason and shared antisemitic messages on Holocaust Remembrance Day.  And that's just to name a few examples. Without long overdue intervention by Republican top brass, the frightening trend towards violent rhetoric seems certain to continue.   Our leaders' statements and actions have consequences. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that the insurrection on January 6 \"would've been armed\" if she had planned it -- the same kind of heated rhetoric Trump used to rile up his supporters before they stormed the Capitol. (She later claimed that she was being sarcastic, and that the comment had been made in jest.)     Many of her rightwing allies in the House have promoted the baseless, unhinged conspiracy theory around \"grooming.\" Small wonder, in the wake of such outlandish statements, that irate protesters are overrunning story hour at their local libraries, and calling for the banning of books from neighborhood schools.   The examples of recent acts of violence that appear to have been instigated by right-wing rhetoric are almost too numerous to name. MAGA rhetoric fueled the attack at the home of former Speaker Pelosi and the vandalization last month -- allegedly by anti-LGBTQ activists -- of the homes of three New York council members over opposition to drag queen story hour at libraries in the city.   Rep. Matt Gaetz encouraged voters to arm themselves at polls, and armed intimidation did take place as voters cast their ballots. Research has even shown that MAGA Republicans are more likely than others -- including GOP moderates -- to endorse violence as usually or always justified to advance their political objectives. And after agents searched Mar-a-Lago, Twitter posts threatening the FBI saw a dramatic spike.    Over-the-top rhetoric by GOP lawmakers is troubling enough. Unfortunately their extremist views also have been all-too-evident in their voting records. That includes the 147 members of Congress who voted against the results of 2020's free and fair election and the 35 House Republicans who voted against the creation of the January 6th Commission.   And -- what was for me a personal affront -- there were 21 Republican members who, in an unconscionable action, voted against DC and Capitol Police officers like me receiving the presidential medal of freedom for our role defending the Capitol during the insurrection.    It might surprise some people who didn't know me before January 6, but I've never considered myself to be a political person. Yes, I voted for Trump in 2016, after being turned off by the anti-police rhetoric on the left.    And sure, I dipped my toe into the last election, to oppose a few Trump-inspired candidates who I thought posed a danger to democracy. But I've never believed in politicians; I believe in people. And that is why I'm supporting two new groups demanding sanity and accountability from our elected politicians.    This week, at an event calling on lawmakers to ramp up the fight against political violence, I'll join veterans, members of Congress, and the group Courage for America, (which I've helped to found and have a leadership role in). Courage for America is joining forces with another, new group Common Defense to call for a renewed effort to combat the kind of right-wing violence that almost ended my life. The planned venue for the event is the Capitol reflecting pool, where just two years ago, MAGA supporters erected a noose which they threatened they'd use to hang the nation's Vice President, amid chants by the rioters of \"hang Mike Pence.\"     As a kid growing up, I was always a bit of a troublemaker; law enforcement turned out to be the perfect landing spot for a rambunctious kid without a clear sense of direction. Becoming a cop taught me to stand up for what's right, and being an investigator taught me to keep revising and refining the conclusions I drew, as I gathered additional information.    In the past couple of years since leaving policing, some of the conclusions I've drawn have had to do with the former president who set the disastrous riot on January 6 in motion. And a lot of my now-negative opinions about him, not surprisingly, have to do with the emotional and physical trauma that I and my brother and sister officers suffered that day. Values I'd always lived by as an officer -- like \"back the blue\" -- were literally hurled back at me by the same mob that was viciously trying to cut us down.   At that moment, even though I was surrounded by violent, shouting protesters, all I could see were my kids' faces: My four daughters are the ones I'm speaking out for.    I want them to be able to live in a country where elected officials are accountable to the people they serve. Condemning political violence isn't a partisan issue. It's a moral one.   I had hoped, as many others did, that outrage and horror over the insurrection would encourage Americans to unify around what should be a shared belief -- that political violence has no place in our society. It's up to Republican leaders to join other Americans who disavow such behavior and the despotic former president who inspired it.   "

  "title": "North Carolina officials will not charge Mark Meadows with voter fraud",
  "date": "2022-12-30T23:17:28Z",
  "text": "The North Carolina Department of Justice announced Friday that there was \"not sufficient evidence\" to bring charges against former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and his wife, Debra Meadows, over allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 election.  \"My office has concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt against either Mr. or Mrs. Meadows, so my office will not prosecute this case,\" North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement. \"If further information relevant to the allegations of voter fraud comes to light in any subsequent investigation or prosecution by authorities in other jurisdictions, we reserve the right to reopen this matter.\" The investigation began after The New Yorker magazine reported that Mark Meadows, a former Republican congressman from North Carolina, registered to vote weeks before the 2020 election at a mobile home in Macon County where he had allegedly never lived or even visited. The article quoted the unnamed former owner of the McConnell Road property in Scaly Mountain as saying that Meadows had never visited or \"spent a night in there\" and that his wife \"reserved the house for two months at some point within the past few years -- she couldn't remember exactly when -- but only spent one or two nights there.\" North Carolina voter records show Meadows registered at the Scaly Mountain address on September 22, 2020. He voted absentee by mail in the 2020 general election. He was removed from the North Carolina voter rolls in April after it was determined Meadows was simultaneously registered to vote in three states.  A memo from prosecutors explaining the decision not to charge the couple states that Mark Meadows was \"almost certainly never physically present at the Scaly Mountain address,\" noting that US Secret Service records showed that he had no official travel and did not request any unaccompanied travel leave to North Carolina from September 2020 to November 2020. However, state law does not \"require the physical presence of a federal government servant in North Carolina in order for them to maintain residence and vote in North Carolina,\" the memo states.  The memo also notes that both Mark and Debra Meadows declined to be interviewed by the State Bureau of Investigation, which conducted the inquiry into the fraud allegations.  According to Friday's release from Stein's office, the \"key facts\" behind the decision not to charge the Meadowses were: (1) He was engaged in public service in Washington, DC, and therefore qualified for a residency exception under state law; (2) the Meadowses signed a yearlong lease for the Scaly Mountain residence that was provided by their landlord; and (3) cell phone records showed Debra Meadows was in and around Scaly Mountain in October 2020. State prosecutors said that the statute of limitations for misdemeanor charges related to false information on an election form had expired by the time the office received the report. The prosecutors wrote that they determined there would be a \"low likelihood of success\" to \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the Meadowses committed a felony by knowingly swearing to false information on their voter forms.  Mark Meadows left Congress in March 2020 to serve as White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump, holding the position until Trump left office the following January. Recent releases of transcripts by the House January 6 committee have included several revelations related to Meadows by his onetime aide Cassidy Hutchinson. They include revelations that he regularly burned documents during the presidential transition period and occasionally told staffers to keep some Oval Office meetings \"close hold\" and potentially omitted from official records.  Stein said in his statement Friday that Mark Meadows \"has made numerous unfounded, damaging allegations about voter fraud both before and after the 2020 election,\" while also noting that \"the bipartisan January 6th congressional committee named Mr. Meadows as a likely co-conspirator over his central role in the January 6th insurrection.\" \"None of the matters involving January 6th, however, are relevant to the specific allegations of voter fraud concerning Mr. and Mrs. Meadows that were referred to my office for review,\" Stein added.  This story has been updated with additional information. "

  "title": "January 6 committee releases final report, says Trump should be barred from office",
  "date": "2022-12-23T17:24:10Z",
  "text": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection recommends barring former President Donald Trump from holding office again. The recommendation is among the conclusions of the panel's final report, a comprehensive overview of the bipartisan panel's findings on how Trump and his allies sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election, released late Thursday evening. The 845-page report -- based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation -- includes allegations that Trump \"oversaw\" the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to \"transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives\" despite concerns among his lawyers that doing so could be unlawful.  In a symbolic move Monday, the committee in its last public meeting referred Trump to the Justice Department on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.   \"That evidence has led to an overriding and straight forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,\" the report states. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said on Monday that he has \"every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we've provided to aid in their work.\"  Special counsel Jack Smith is leading the Justice Department's investigations related to Trump, including both his post-election actions and classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.  Trump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the \"highly partisan\" report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud. Here's what's in the report: Trump and his inner circle engaged in 'at least 200' attempts to pressure state officials  In an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials in \"at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation,\" between Election Day and the January 6 attack, according to the report.    There were 68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages, aimed at state or local officials, as well as 125 social media posts by Trump or senior aides targeting state officials.  Trump \"spearheaded outreach aimed at numerous officials in States he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona,\" the report says. (He lost all of those states.)  For example, during a January 2, 2021, call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the then-president went through a \"litany of false election-fraud claims\" and then asked Raffensperger to deliver him a second term by \"finding\" just enough votes to ensure victory, according to the report.   Trump infamously said, \"I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\"  Committee identifies pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as architect of fake electors plot The January 6 committee identifies a little known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro. Conservative attorney John Eastman authored a now-infamous memo detailing step-for-step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could theoretically overturn the 2020 election results. But the committee points to Chesebro, a known associate of Eastman, as being responsible for creating the fake electors plot. \"The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,\" the report says. It was previously known that Chesebro was involved in the fake electors scheme, but the committee's conclusion about his leadership role is new. The effort to put forward fake slates of pro-Trump electors is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden's election victory in 2020. The committee wrote that Chesebro sent a memo to then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani after a request from Trump campaign official Boris Epshteyn about a \"'President of the Senate' strategy,\" which wrongly asserted that the vice president could pick which presidential electors to count during the joint session of Congress on January 6. \"President Trump in the days immediately before January 6th, Chesebro -- an attorney based in Boston and New York recruited to assist the Trump Campaign as a volunteer legal advisor -- was central to the creation of the plan,\" the report says. \"Memos by Chesebro on November 18th, December 9th, and December 13th, as discussed below, laid the plan's foundation.\" CNN has previously asked Chesebro to comment about these topics and he has not responded. Trump WH called Eastman on the day he wrote his memo  Eastman reached out to speak to Trump on December 23, 2020, the same day that he drafted his initial memo on the Pence theory. Eastman emailed Trump's assistant, Molly Michael, at 1:32 p.m., according to the committee. \"Is the President available for a very quick call today at some point? Just want to update him on our overall strategic thinking.\" The committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard, and the call lasted 23 minutes, according to Eastman's phone records. Eastman's two-page memo discussed various ways to ensure \"President Trump is re-elected,\" even though by then, he had been projected to lose the election, according to the committee. These new details show how the committee used emails and phone records it obtained after it successfully fought in court to obtain the documents.  The committee obtained Eastman's emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government. Trump latched onto Eastman's theories that incorrectly claimed Pence could overturn the election, and launched a pressure campaign against Pence in the days leading up to January 6. Eastman was present at a January 4, 2021, meeting between Trump and Pence in the Oval Office where Trump tried to convince Pence he could intervene when Congress certified the Electoral College vote on January 6. January 6 committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again Barring Trump from further public office is one of 11 recommendations the committee is making as a result of its investigation.   The panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has \"engaged in an insurrection\" or given \"aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution\" can be disqualified from office. The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.  It calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a \"formal mechanism\" for evaluating whether those individuals violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.  Says lawyers should be held responsible  In addition to criminal referrals, the select committee is calling for lawyers involved in the efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.   \"Those courts and bar disciplinary bodies responsible for overseeing the legal profession in the states and the District of Columbia should continue to evaluate the conduct of attorneys described in this Report\" the panel writes, adding that there are specific attorneys the report identifies as having \"conflicts of interests\" for the Department of Justice to evaluate.  The report even calls on Congress to amend statutes and consider the severity of penalties that deter individuals from efforts to obstruct, influence or impede the Joint Session of Congress that certifies election results. It calls for statutes of federal penalties for certain types of threats against election workers to be strengthened.  Although the panel was successful in getting more than 1,000 witnesses to testify as part of its investigation, it still had difficulty gaining cooperation from everyone it wanted to speak to. Its report recommends congressional committees of jurisdiction \"develop legislation\" to create \"a cause of action\" for the House to enforce its subpoenas in federal court.    Electoral Count Act reform One recommendation may soon become reality.   The panel calls on Congress to pass an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election -- the first legislative response to the insurrection and Trump's relentless pressure campaign to stay in power. The House and Senate have each passed their own version of the legislation. Committee refers Trump to Justice Department The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump's defeat and says there's evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Eastman and \"others.\"     The report summary first released Monday says there's evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.    The panel says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.  The committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.   Trump's false victory declaration was 'premeditated'   The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.    \"President Trump's decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,\" the report states.   The committee a"

  "title": "Key takeaways from the January 6 committee's final report",
  "date": "2022-12-23T13:31:31Z",
  "text": "The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, laid out a damning case over 800-plus pages that former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election led to the violence at the US Capitol, documenting the ex-chief executive's actions for the record and potentially for criminal investigators.   On Monday, the committee referred Trump to the Justice Department on four criminal charges. On Thursday, the committee effectively showed its work for why it believes Trump is criminally liable for his actions.  In its report, the committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again.  Trump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the \"highly partisan\" report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud. Here are key takeaways from the committee's final report:   The committee's full case against Trump  The committee spared no words in laying blame for the violence on January 6 squarely at Trump's feet.   After holding nine public hearings and releasing a summary of the report earlier this week, the final document reads like an indictment of Trump, explaining his direct role in every facet of the plot to overturn the 2020 election -- drawing a clear through-line between Trump's election denialism and the violence that unfolded.  The panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the Constitution but has \"engaged in an insurrection\" or given \"aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution\" can be disqualified from office.   The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection. The panel calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a \"formal mechanism\" for evaluating whether those individuals who violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.  Despite Trump's attempts to shift blame to Democrats for the security failures that day and a GOP rebuttal report released earlier this week that entirely glossed over the former president's own role in the attack, the select committee report is an effective conclusion to the panel's 18-month long investigation.   It leaves no doubt that the committee believes Trump, and Trump alone, was responsible for the January 6 attack.   \"None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,\" the report states.  Report pieces together a comprehensive narrative There were no major new bombshells in the report that the committee released Thursday -- instead the committee focused on laying out the depth and detail of its work across its investigation.  The report offered the most comprehensive account to date of what transpired in the two months between Election Day on November 3, 2020, and Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021.   It's a narrative that expands upon the committee's public hearings over the summer, walking readers step-by-step through the various schemes Trump orchestrated and the help he had from allies inside and outside his administration.   Along the way, the committee showed more details about what it had learned in the 1,000-plus witnesses interviews conducted over the 18-month investigation, including tidbits it hadn't released publicly previously, such as Trump lawyer Eric Herschmann's call with Rudy Giuliani the morning of January 6, and that Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials at least 200 times.   It's more than just Trump  The committee's public hearings were largely focused on Trump's role, and there were questions in the weeks leading up to the report's release about how much it would go beyond the former president.  But while the report's main headlines were all about Trump, the final report also offers a definitive picture of the attack on Congress, the contributing factors within American discourse as well as law enforcement preparedness and failures.  The report puts in one place intelligence assessments before January 6 from the federal government, including key messages that law enforcement had seen among Trump supporters on online forums.  The committee also interviewed leaders of agencies who were directing law enforcement response, such as the Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser and police force heads.   The select committee also says it interviewed 24 witnesses and reviewed 37,000 pages of documents for a review of the response of the DC National Guard, which attempts to explain the delayed response of the force to the Capitol.  The committee was told, for instance, that commander of the DC National Guard, Major Gen. William Walker, \"strongly\" considered deploying troops to the US Capitol on the afternoon of January 6 without approval from his superiors even if it meant he would have to resign the next day.  No corroboration for SUV fight  The committee was not able to corroborate a secondhand account from former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson that she was told Trump lunged at his lead Secret Service agent while in his presidential SUV on January 6 and tried to grab the steering wheel because he was angry he wasn't being taken to the Capitol.    Perhaps in an attempt to pivot beyond the explosive anecdote itself, the select committee emphasized that their goal was to discover the intent behind Trump's actions in the SUV. Many witnesses, including Trump's press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and the Secret Service press secretary, have said Trump wanted to go to the Capitol and was angry when told he could not.    Both the driver of Trump's SUV and the lead Secret Service agent that day, Robert Engel, told the panel they did not remember the events of that day the way that Hutchinson described them.   \"Engel did not characterize the exchange in the vehicle the way Hutchinson described the account she heard from (deputy White House chief of staff Tony) Ornato, and indicated that he did not recall President Trump gesturing toward him,\" the panel wrote.   Engel also told the panel he did not remember being present when Ornato told the story with Hutchinson in the room.   Hutchinson testified over the summer that she was told the story by Ornato while Engel was in the room and he did not dispute Ornato's account.   The driver of the vehicle testified to the committee that he did not recall seeing what Trump was doing or if there was movement.   But, the driver described Trump as \"animated and irritated,\" and testified that Trump said shortly after getting in the vehicle, \"I'm the President and I'll decide where I get to go.\"  Ornato told the panel he did not recall communications about the incident in the SUV and had no knowledge of Trump's anger, the report says.   The committee makes clear in its report it does not find Ornato's testimony credible.  Report underscored importance of docs obtained from court fights  The committee's report underscores how the House's successful court fights to pry loose documents, emails and phone records played a major role in helping the committee flesh out its narrative of January 6.   Some of the most explosive moments of the committee's investigation stemmed from records the committee obtained, from text messages of former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and other top aides to emails from conservative lawyer John Eastman about Vice President Mike Pence's role on January 6.   The committee obtained Eastman's emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government.   The report included some new details from the emails, including how Eastman emailed Trump's assistant the day he drafted his memo that falsely claimed Pence could block certification of the election on January 6. Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard shortly thereafter, according to phone records the committee obtained.  In addition to Eastman, the committee identifies a little-known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro. \"The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,\" the report says.  The final report -- not the final documents  Thursday's report is the committee's final word on January 6 -- but the committee isn't done releasing documents just yet.  In addition to its summary and report released this week, the committee also started rolling out some of the transcripts from closed-door depositions, including interviews with numerous witnesses who invoked their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination as well as bombshell testimony from Hutchinson.  There are more transcripts expected in the committee's final days from other witness testimony, teasing out evermore details in the hours before the committee is dissolved, as is expected in the new Congress.  Several parties will be eagerly awaiting their release, including GOP lawmakers and Trump himself, who is still facing legal scrutiny on several fronts related to his role in the January 6 insurrection and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.   The committee has already begun sharing evidence with the Justice Department and special counsel Jack Smith, CNN reported this week.  "

  "title": "'He knows he lost': Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Trump acknowledged he lost 2020 election",
  "date": "2022-12-23T01:22:25Z",
  "text": "Shortly after the 2020 election was called for Joe Biden, then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told his aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, that President Donald Trump knew he lost but wanted to keep fighting to overturn the results, according to a newly released transcript from the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The transcript of Hutchinson's September 14, 2022, interview with the committee, which took place after she testified publicly, was released Thursday by the panel. It details post-election conversations that Hutchinson described, where multiple people said Trump acknowledged he had lost but was unwilling to concede.  Hutchinson testified that Meadows told her on November 18, 2020, that Trump \"has pretty much acknowledged that he's lost,\" the transcript says. \"A lot of times he'll tell me that he lost, but he wants to keep fighting it, and he thinks that there might be enough to overturn the election,\" Meadows told Hutchinson that day about Trump, according to her retelling of the conversation. Hutchinson also testified that in late December 2020, Meadows lamented to her that Trump would get upset any time he mentioned the transition, telling the committee that Meadows said something to the effect of: \"he's just so angry at me all the time I can't talk to him about anything post-White House without him getting mad that we didn't win.\" \"Later in the interview, Hutchinson told the committee she spoke with Meadows immediately after a call with Georgia officials on January 2, 2021, where Trump pushed officials to help overturn the election results there.\" \"He said something to the effect of, 'he knows it's over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying. There's a chance he didn't lose. I want to pull this off for him,'\" Hutchinson said, recounting what Meadows told her about Trump. Hutchinson doubles down on testimony about Trump fighting with security detail  In a September 15 deposition, Hutchinson echoed her testimony that she heard about Trump fighting with his security detail on January 6, according to another deposition transcript. Hutchinson, who faced an onslaught of public criticism and pushback from Trump allies after she revealed the story she was told about Trump supposedly lunging at the driver of his presidential SUV on January 6, 2021, because he was angry that they wouldn't take him to the US Capitol. During that public hearing, she said she heard the story from Tony Ornato, who was serving as deputy White House chief of staff at the time.  But after her public hearing and the avalanche of pushback, Hutchinson said she had \"no doubts\" about her previous testimony.   \"I have no doubts in the conversation that I had with Mr. Ornato on January 6th. I have no doubts in how I've relayed that story privately and publicly\" Hutchinson said, according to the transcript, which was released Thursday.  She also shared that Ornato made \"sarcastic offhand remarks\" to her about the story at least two times after he initially mentioned it -- on January 19 and April 16 -- according to the transcript.  \"I have no doubts about the two instances on January 19th and April 16th about the conversation,\" Hutchinson added.  In the April 16 call, Hutchinson described a phone conversation to committee investigators where Ornato made a comment like \"it could be worse. The president could have tried to kill -- he didn't say kill -- the president could have tried to strangle you on January 6.\"  Hutchinson acknowledged that Ornato did not specify he was referring to the incident on January 6 but she said, \"I assumed from the context of our phone call and from the conversations that we had had while still at the White House that he was referencing that incident. I have no reason to believe that he was referencing any other incident.\"   In June, Hutchinson publicly testified that Ornato told her about an altercation between the former president and the head of his Secret Service detail when he was told he could not go to the Capitol on January 6. The committee wrote in its report summary, which was released Monday, that they were unable to get Ornato to corroborate Hutchinson's testimony about the alleged altercation in the presidential SUV. The committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the committee about the Ornato conversation. But \"Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the president's anger.\" The committee also released six more interview transcripts Thursday night, shedding new light on their closed-door sessions with key witnesses. In one transcript, Sarah Matthews, a former White House deputy press secretary, told the committee that Trump tried to get then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany to hold briefings about supposed fraud tied to Dominion voting machines -- but McEnany refused. \"She felt uncomfortable promoting the Dominion conspiracy theory, and that the president had asked her to talk about that during interviews\" Matthews told committee investigators. \"He did request her to do briefings on it as well, but we did not.\" Matthews added that Trump encouraged McEnany to also put forward these conspiracy theories on cable news hits, which she said made McEnany uncomfortable and led to her attempting to avoid Trump after the election. Matthews testified publicly over the summer about how Trump's conduct on January 6 led her to resign by the end of that day."

  "text": "Roger Stone\u2019s interview with the Jan. 6 select committee lasted 51 minutes and pleaded with Fifth Amendment for every question that was asked, the panel's transcripts show. Stone did not comment on anything the panel put in front of him, including photographs, public statements, video clips of interviews, and text messages. He also took the Fifth when asked basic questions like his age.\u00a0\u00a0 Stone did not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before Jan. 6, or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set a \u201cwar room\u201d on Jan. 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on Jan. 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all.\u00a0 He was previously convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian meddling in 2016. Prosecutors argued that he lied to protect then-President Donald Trump, who pardoned him in 2020, before leaving office. Through its questioning, the select committee investigators delved into how the Oath Keepers coordinated to protect Stone when he was in Washington, DC, on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. A group chat through the encrypted messaging app Signal included Stone and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, who has been convicted of seditious conspiracy. Stone wrote, \u201cthis group is for all event organizers and VIP speakers who need Oath Keepers PSD or event security on Jan 5/6 so they can talk to me and my top OK team leaders all in one place.\u201d\u00a0Rhodes later messaged that Kelly Meggs from Florida would be Stone\u2019s protection.\u00a0\u00a0 The select committee asked about text exchanges between Stone and \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from Jan. 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day.\u00a0 \u201cAs I expected, no speaking spot, no VIP entrance for any of my people\u201d Stone said to Alexander at approximately 10:02 a.m. A few hours later, Alexander wrote to stone, \u201cget your ass to the US Capitol\u201d and added \u201cwe have a stage & the presidents order.\u201d The House select committee looking into the Jan. 6 insurrection on Wednesday night released the first tranche of transcripts of interviews from its 17-month investigation. \"Today, the Select Committee made public 34 transcripts of witness testimony that was gathered over the course of the Select Committee\u2019s investigation into the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol,\" the panel said in a news release.\u00a0 Read them here:  Christopher Barcenas\nKathy Berden\nAlexander Bruesewitz\nPatrick Casey\nDion Cini\nJeffrey Clark\u00a0Part 1,\u00a0Part 2\nJim DeGraffenreid\nEnrique De La Torre\nJohn Eastman\nJenna Ellis\nKimberly Fletcher\nMichael Flynn\nNick Fuentes\nJulie Fancelli\nBianca Gracia\nAlex Jones\nRyan Kelley\nCharlie Kirk\nDavid Scott Kuntz\nAntonio LaMotta\nPhilip Luelsdorff\nRobert Patrick Lewis\nJoshua Macias\nShawna Martin\nJohn Matze\nMichael McDonald\nStewart Rhodes\nMayra Rodriguez\nMichael Roman\nRoger Stone\nEnrique Tarrio\nPhil Waldron\nKelli Ward\nGarrett Ziegler Former President Donald Trump\u2019s one-time national security adviser, Michael Flynn, asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question asked by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection during his interview with the panel, the transcript of his testimony released Wednesday confirms. Flynn answered a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called \u201cThe America Project,\u201d which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne. He also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him. \u201cBecause I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,\u201d Flynn said.\u00a0 But when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee\u2019s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition. Flynn\u2019s lawyer noted during the interview that his client was appearing before the committee while a lawsuit to quash the panel\u2019s subpoena was still pending. Among the questions Flynn responded to by invoking his Fifth Amendment protections, were about his communications with Trump, White House staff, officials at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, officials at the Department of Justice and attorneys representing the former president about election fraud or other irregularities. More background: CNN has previously reported that Flynn played a central role in not only spreading baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and pushed US officials to investigate claims about foreign manipulation of voting machines. During an Oval Office meeting with Trump in mid-December 2020, Flynn also proposed using the federal government to seize voting machines, sources previously told CNN.  House Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies that responded that day. Their primary recommendation centers around reforming the Capitol Police Board and bolstering congressional oversight of the Capitol police force \u2013 two issues that were identified by lawmakers of both parties in the wake of Jan. 6. But the GOP report is silent on other efforts to disrupt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election and selective in its criticism of political leaders and their culpability in the security breakdowns on Jan. 6. The report resurfaces largely unfounded allegations to cast blame on Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while glossing over former President Donald Trump\u2019s own role.\u00a0\u00a0 Republicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the House select committee\u2019s investigation into Jan. 6 as they are set to take control of the chamber and endeavor to take back the narrative. Republican lawmakers have said the security failures are paramount and that the select committee overstepped its mandate in its 17-month probe. The Democrat-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until Thursday. An executive summary released on Monday lays blame for the insurrection squarely on Trump. More on the report: The GOP report comes from the five Republicans who Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially appointed to serve on the select committee before deciding members of his party would not participate. It includes a timeline of events that occurred on Jan. 6, making no mention of the fact that Trump waited hours before calling on the rioters to leave the US Capitol that day and omitting incendiary remarks he made at the rally preceding the attack.\u00a0 Instead, the report paints Trump as only encouraging his supporters at the White House Ellipse to march to the US Capitol and demonstrate \u201cpeacefully,\u201d noticeably omitting other parts of the speech, including when he encouraged rally goers to \u201cfight light hell.\u201d Similarly, the timeline includes a tweet Trump sent after the Capitol had been breached, saying: \u201cPlease support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\u201d\u00a0 Missing from the report is Trump\u2019s tweet in which he eventually told the rioters to leave the Capitol \u2013 several hours after the deadly riot began. The select committee has revealed witness testimony from several former White House officials saying Trump repeatedly refused to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so by a number of his closest advisers. The GOP report also doesn\u2019t address Trump\u2019s claim that he issued a directive prior to Jan. 6 to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to the Capitol that day. Trump's former Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, in an interview with the select committee, denied Trump gave him formal orders authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to the Capitol on Jan. 6. In an updated guidance, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol said it \u201cnow anticipates its final report will be filed and released tomorrow.\u201d The committee also said the release of other records is possible today. The panel originally said the report would be released Wednesday. Members of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report expected to be released Wednesday.  The committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\u00a0 Rep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\u00a0 Here's who is on the panel: Democrats:\u00a0 Chair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\u00a0\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\nRep. Adam Schiff of California Republicans\u00a0 Vice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois ##Catch Up##  The final report the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack is set to release Wednesday launches a new era for criminal investigators, politicians, and members of the public who have been eager to see the nuts and bolts of its work. Here's what to watch for: Detail on possible obstruction of the investigation In the summary of its report released earlier this week, the panel revealed it is aware of \u201cmultiple efforts by President Donald Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses,\u201d adding that DOJ is aware \u201cof at least one of those circumstances.\u201d The summary released Monday also claimed the panel has a \u201crange of evidence suggesting specific efforts to obstruct the Committee\u2019s investigation.\u201d That includes concerns that attorneys paid by Trump\u2019s political committee or allied groups \u201chave specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients.\u201d Details of Trump\u2019s effort to visit the Capitol The summary details that the panel was ultimately unable to get former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump\u2019s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol following his speech on the Ellipse. The committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the panel about the Ornato conversation. But \u201cOrnato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President\u2019s anger.\u201d The committee wrote that it \u201chas significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony\u201d and vowed to release his transcript publicly. Fundraising efforts In terms of financing after the 2020 presidential election and through the Jan. 6 rallies, the committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump \u201craised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th.\u201d \u201cThose solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist,\u201d the panel wrote. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, has said the panel has evidence that members of the Trump family and inner circle \u2013 including Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 personally benefited from money that was raised based on the former president\u2019s false election claims, but the panel has never gone as far to say a financial crime has been committed. Read more on what to watch for here. ##Findings## ##Trump## The\u00a0Jan. 6 committee\u00a0made a startling allegation on Monday, claiming it had evidence that a Trump-backed attorney urged a key witness to mislead the committee about details they recalled. In the executive summary of the final report, the committee revisited the issue in its handoff of the investigation to the Justice Department. According to the report, \u201cthe lawyer had advised the witness that the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.\u201d The committee declined to identify the people. What we know: However, CNN has learned that Stefan Passantino, the top ethics attorney in the Trump White House, is the lawyer who allegedly advised his then-client, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, to tell the committee that she did not recall details that she did, sources familiar with the committee\u2019s work tell CNN. Before her public testimony, Hutchinson dropped Passantino and\u00a0got a new lawyer. Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee funded Passantino and his law firm Elections LLC, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson, other sources tell CNN. The committee report notes the lawyer did not tell his client who was paying for the legal services. In a statement to CNN, Passantino said he didn\u2019t advise Hutchinson to mislead the committee. \u201cI represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically, and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. I believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the Committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.\u201d Passantino pointed out it\u2019s not uncommon for people to change lawyers \u201cbecause their interests or strategies change,\u201d according to his statement. He also said political committees sometimes cover client fees \u201cat the client\u2019s request.\u201d By Tuesday, Passantino\u2019s professional biography had been removed from the website of a midwestern-based law firm where he was a partner \u2013 and he acknowledged in his statement he was on a leave of absence from the firm \u201cgiven the distraction of this matter.\u201d He remains a partner at Elections LLC. Lawyers must follow extensive ethics guidelines as part of their profession, including avoiding conflicts of interest that could compromise their representation of a client. According to legal ethics experts, a lawyer swaying their client\u2019s testimony in a way that wouldn\u2019t be entirely truthful could be looked at as possible obstruction of an investigation. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has started handing over evidence \u2014 documents and\u00a0transcripts \u2014\u00a0to the Justice Department in the last week, according to a source familiar with the matter. Special Counsel Jack Smith had sent a letter to the committee on Dec. 5, requesting all of the information from the panel\u2019s investigation, another source told CNN. The information transfer focuses specifically on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump\u2019s former election lawyer John Eastman, the source added. The DOJ also received Meadows text messages from the committee. The panel also has started to share transcripts of witness interviews pertaining to the false slates of electors and the pressure campaign by the former president and his allies on certain states to overturn the 2020 election results. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually given some\u00a0transcripts\u00a0to the Department of Justice during the last month,\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the select committee, told CNN Monday. The committee also is slated to release its full final report today. Spokespersons for the committee and for the special counsel did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The final report from the House select committee investigating\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, will include information about Republican National Committee fundraising directly after the 2020 presidential election, what Secret Service knew ahead of the attack and the response by the National Guard, committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar said earlier this month.  \u201cThose are all important aspects that we look forward to highlighting and sharing at the conclusion of our work,\u201d the California Democrat who serves on the House select committee said in a wide-ranging interview that aired exclusively on \u201cCNN This Morning.\" The comments from Aguilar expand on themes the committee has presented in its previous hearings and detail to a new level what is expected to appear in the final report. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has previously told CNN the panel\u2019s final report will contain eight chapters. Some information in the report will be redacted due to security concerns, according to Aguilar. \u201cThere are some aspects that are law enforcement sensitive that may be redacted in some small ways, but our intention is to ensure that that this material gets out into the public and that people get to see the material by which we have made conclusions and recommendations on,\u201d Aguilar said. He added that \u201cthere have been some conversations with people who came before us, where we indicated we would redact some small pieces,\u201d such as current workplaces, that are important to protect. With its mic drop finale,\u00a0the House committee\u00a0investigating\u00a0the US Capitol insurrection\u00a0left a fateful question hanging over Washington, Donald Trump and the 2024 presidential campaign: will the ex-president be charged with a crime?  The committee announced in\u00a0its final public meeting\u00a0on Monday it was recommending to the Justice Department that Trump be prosecuted on\u00a0at least four charges, carefully matching the panel\u2019s catalog of violence, lies, insurrection and dereliction of duty up to and on January 6, 2021, with specific legal statutes. Yet the panel, despite delivering what it called a \u201croadmap to justice,\u201d has no power to try Trump and its decisions are not binding on the Justice Department.  The DOJ has its own investigation and faces prosecutorial decisions that require a higher bar than the committee\u2019s political gambits. The potential charges concerned also have little case law precedent.  And while both Attorney General Merrick Garland and the House committee have long argued that every American should be subject to equal justice, the gravity of indicting an ex-president and current White House candidate who has already used violence as a political tool means the department\u2019s dilemma is among the most fateful in American history. More broadly, the committee has now sketched the most urgent framing of a perennial question about Trump\u2019s riotous careers in business and politics: Will he ever face accountability for his rule-breaking conduct?  The question is especially acute given that the norm crushed this time almost toppled US democracy. Read the full analysis here.  ##Analysis## For months, the Jan. 6 committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn\u2019t equivocate. The committee referred Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, including:  Obstructing an official proceeding\nDefrauding the United States\nMaking false statements \nAssisting or aiding an insurrection The panel said in its executive summary that it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy. So what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee\u2019s final report \u2013 to be released Wednesday \u2013 will provide justification from the panel\u2019s investigation for recommending the charges. In practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation. But the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department\u2019s court. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said during Monday's meeting that he has \u201cevery confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\u2019ve provided to aid in their work.\u201d After the panel's meeting, Thompson told CNN that the evidence that supports the panel's decision to refer Trump to the DOJ is \"clear,\" adding that he is \"convinced\" that the department will ultimately charge Trump. CNN's Tierney Sneed contributed reporting to this post.  ##Trump## On Monday, the January 6 committee released an\u00a0executive summary of its report, and it plans to release the full report on Wednesday, as well as transcripts of committee interviews. Here are takeaways from the committee\u2019s final public meeting: Committee refers Trump to DOJ. The committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy. All roads lead to Trump. Committee members repeatedly pointed to Trump\u2019s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on January 6. Monday\u2019s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break \u201cthe foundation of American democracy.\u201d Committee uses video to illustrate case. The committee showed a video montage laying out all of its allegations against Trump, from witnesses saying that Trump was told he lost the election by his aides to the former president\u2019s failure to act on January 6 as the violence at the Capitol was unfolding. The montage went step-by-step through Trump\u2019s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters. A bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois described how his House GOP colleagues were complicit in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election. He highlighted evidence that Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to \u201cput the facade of legitimacy\u201d on his voter fraud claims so \u201cRepublican congressmen \u2026 can distort and destroy and create doubt\u201d about the 2020 election results. ##Catch Up## The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol\u00a0has concluded that former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes. The summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn\u2019t willing to help him overturn his election defeat \u2014 while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee\u2019s investigation. The committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump\u2019s intent: that he \u201cpurposely disseminated false allegations of fraud\u201d in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. \u201cThese false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.\u201d The full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation. Here are some key things from the report summary: Committee referring Trump and others to DOJ: The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump\u2019s defeat and says there\u2019s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and \u201cothers.\u201d The report summary says there\u2019s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy. Trump's false victory was \"premeditated\": The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway. Trump\u2019s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say: Sources familiar with Trump\u2019s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration. In making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense. Several members of Congress being referred to House Ethics Committee: The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas. Trump and others may try this again, committee warns: The summary\u2019s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department\u2019s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol. The committee says that Trump \u201cbelieved then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.\u201d ##Findings##"

  "text": "The full report was published December 22, 2021. Read here. The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.    \"That evidence has led to an overriding and straight-forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,\" the committee writes in a summary of its final report released on Monday. \"None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.\" The summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn't willing to help him overturn his election defeat -- while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee's investigation.  The committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump's intent: that he \"purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud\" in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. \"These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.\"  The full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.  Here's what's in the report summary:   The committee thinks Trump and others committed crimes, and is referring them to DOJ   The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump's defeat and says there's evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and \"others.\"     The report summary says there's evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.    The committee says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.  In addition, several others are named as being participants in the conspiracies the committee is linking to Trump, including then-DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump-tied lawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani.   The committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.   Several of the individuals named by the committee -- including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani -- had their own responses Monday.  Trump's false victory declaration was 'premeditated'   The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.    \"President Trump's decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,\" the summary states.   The committee revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.     It also notes that Trump's top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president's claims.     \"Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,\" the summary states, referring to Trump's then-personal attorney.   \"For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that 'I do not think the machines stole the election,'\" it states.    Trump's belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say   Sources familiar with Trump's legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.     In making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.   In describing why the committee believes Trump's conduct meet the prongs of each criminal statute, the summary stresses evidence that Trump had been warned that his schemes were unlawful.  Trump raised about $250 million by crying fraud   The committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump \"raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th. Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist.\"      \"For example, the Trump Campaign, along with the Republican National Committee, sent millions of emails to their supporters, with messaging claiming that the election was 'rigged,' that their donations could stop Democrats from 'trying to steal the election,' and that Vice President Biden would be an 'illegitimate president' if he took office,'\" the summary states.   Several members of Congress are being referred to the House Ethics Committee   The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee.      House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.   Concerns about witness credibility and Trump-allied attorneys   The committee raised concerns that attorneys paid by Trump's political committee or allied groups were incentivized to protect the former president, saying, \"lawyers who are receiving such payments have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients. The Department of Justice and the Fulton County District Attorney have been provided with certain information related to this topic.\"     In one instance, a witness whose lawyer was being paid by a Trump-allied group was told she could \"in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.\" When the witness raised concerns with her lawyer about that approach, the lawyer said, \"They don't know what you know, [witness]. They don't know that you can recall some of these things. So you saying 'I don't recall' is an entirely acceptable response to this,\" according to the report summary.  When it came to a specific issue that reflected negatively on Trump, the lawyer told his client, \"No, no, no, no, no. We don't want to go there. We don't want to talk about that.\"  The committee notes both Trump and his allies attempted to contact witnesses ahead of their committee testimony.    \"The Select Committee is aware of multiple efforts by President Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses. The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,\" according to the summary.  Ivanka Trump and Kayleigh McEnany The committee also, in its final report, highlighted two high-profile witnesses -- Ivanka Trump and then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany -- as being less cooperative than others. They and others \"displayed a lack of full recollection of certain issues, or were not otherwise as frank or direct as Cipollone.\" In another instance, Trump had an angry conversation with Pence in which he referred to the then-vice president as \"The P word,\" according to a committee interview with Ivanka Trump's chief of staff, Julie Radford.   In Radford's recollection, the name-calling was upsetting to Ivanka at the time, but when the committee asked Ivanka whether there were any \"particular words\" her father used in the conversation with Pence, \"She answered simply: 'No.'\"   The summary states: \"In several circumstances, the Committee has found that less senior White House aides had significantly better recollection of events than senior staff purported to have.\"  As for McEnany, the committee called her testimony \"evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points,\" noting she was deposed early in the investigation and wasn't as forthcoming as others from Trump's press office. Impropriety by Trump Justice Department officials   The report points the finger at two Trump appointees at the Justice Department who the committee believes abused their positions and acted unethically.    Clark, the former acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, is already well known for trying to weaponize the Justice Department to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. The committee raises the prospect that Clark broke the law. The Justice Department is already investigating Clark and federal agents have searched his home.       One of the most egregious things Clark did was draft a letter for the Justice Department to send to election officials in battleground states, urging them to essentially overturn their results. The letter, crafted with help from fellow Trump appointee Ken Klukowski, falsely asserted that the department believed there were problems with the results.    \"This was an intentional choice by Jeff Clark to contradict specific Department findings on election fraud, and purposely insert the Department into the Presidential election on President Trump's behalf and risk creating or exacerbating a constitutional crisis,\" the summary states.    In a new development, the panel flagged its concerns about Klukowski's conduct.       He worked for the Trump campaign before joining the Justice Department during the final weeks of the administration. And while at the department's civil division, he spent some of his time helping Clark with his attempts to overturn the election, \"despite the fact that election-related matters are not part of the Civil portfolio,\" the summary says.    Trump and others may try this again, committee warns   The summary's section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department's prosecutions should exten"

  "text": "The Jan. 6 committee used its\u00a0final public meeting\u00a0Monday to summarize its 17-month investigation with a simple closing statement: All roads lead to\u00a0Donald Trump. Here are some of the key takeaways: The committee refers Trump to the DOJ For months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.

All roads lead to Trump Committee members repeatedly pointed to Trump\u2019s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6. Monday\u2019s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break \u201cthe foundation of American democracy.\u201d Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory. Visually reinforcing their argument The committee relied once again on video \u2014 an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump. The montage went step-by-step through Trump\u2019s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters. A bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor Though GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan. Two Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee. To be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump\u2019s critiques of the committee \u2014 that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans. No matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel\u2019s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan. Read more takeaways here ##Catch Up## After the Jan. 6 committee's final public session Monday, some people named in the summary of the final report, as well as some of those who were referred by the committee, are reacting to the conclusion to the nearly year and a half investigation. The committee approved a criminal referral for three charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department. The former president responded on Truth Social,  saying that the committee\u2019s actions would make \u201chim stronger\u201d and indicated that the referrals today were part of a larger attempt to stop him from running for President in 2024. Trump\u2019s base has had a history of galvanizing behind him when Trump is in legal peril, including when he Mar-a-Lago home was searched by the FBI. As Trump\u2019s political support has seemingly waned in recent weeks, it is unclear that these criminal referrals will have the same effect. The committee said it was also advancing criminal referrals for attorney John Eastman and \"others\" to the Justice Department for investigation and potential prosecution. There is evidence to justify an Eastman referral to DOJ on obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States, the committee said Monday.\u00a0Raskin said that the committee believed the conduct of others may also warrant Justice Department investigation and prosecution, but those referrals were not identified\u00a0on Monday. Eastman decried the committee\u2019s \u201cStalinist\u201d tactics said he had\u00a0not\u00a0yet received a subpoena in the DOJ criminal probe now being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith.\u00a0 \u201cOne hopes that the Department of Justice doesn't act on\u00a0this referral, understanding the significance of what has been done here and not being willing to take that step,\u201d Eastman said on a virtual press call with reporters Monday afternoon.  He said that he had a \u201cwhole lot of information\u201d to defend himself if federal prosecutors decided to bring a case against him. He also said that a federal judge \u201cgot it wrong\u201d when the judge concluded that a handful of Eastman\u2019s emails showed evidence of a crime. Other referrals: The House select committee is referring four members of Congress to the House\u2019s Ethics Committee after those members did not comply with the subpoenas from the panel. An executive summary released after the meeting identifies the four Republicans as GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Rep. Jim Jordan, called the referral a \"partisan and political stunt\" by the committee. In a statement, he claimed the panel \"knowingly altered evidence, blocked minority representation on a Committee for the first time in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, and failed to respond to Mr. Jordan\u2019s numerous letters and concerns surrounding the politicization and legitimacy of the Committee\u2019s work.\u201d CNN has also reached out to the other lawmakers. Others named in the summary: In addition, several others are named as being participants in the conspiracies the committee is linking to Trump, including then-DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump-tied lawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani. Ted Goodman, communications and political advisor to Rudy Giuliani, a former lawyer for Donald Trump and former mayor of New York City, said in a statement: \"Mayor Rudy Giuliani wasn't drinking election night and we have multiple in-person witnesses on the record to back this up. Anyone saying otherwise is either mistaken or shamefully lying about Mayor Giuliani \u2014 an honest, good American who has dedicated his life to serving others and doing the right thing.\"\u00a0 The House select committee said in an executive summary of its final report that on election night in 2020, \u201cthe only advisor present who supported President Trump\u2019s inclination to declare victory was Rudolph Giuliani, who appeared to be inebriated,\u201d citing testimony the panel received. ##Referrals## Senate Republicans are divided over the Jan. 6 investigation \u2014 and also over Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's comments saying the \"entire nation\" blames former President Donald Trump for the attack. Asked if he agrees, Sen. Rick Scott said, \"I haven't seen a poll like that.\" While some like Sen. Mitt Romney agreed with McConnell, others refused to go that far. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of McConnell's leadership team, said the investigation was not credible. Asked if he agreed with McConnell's statement, Cornyn wouldn't say, but added, \"I don't dispute that people saw it with their own eyes.\" Sen. Josh Hawley declined to comment on McConnell and dismissed the committee's referral to the Justice Department. Sen. Tommy Tuberville also answered \"no\" when asked if he agreed with McConnell, adding of the entire investigation that \"this committee is self-serving. We've got a lot more problems than rehashing this whole thing.\" \"There's a lot of people responsible,\" Tuberville said. Sen. Kevin Cramer said, \"I\u00a0don't know who he said was responsible but to me, the people that were responsible for January 6 were the people that illegally came into the building, people that stormed over barriers and broke through windows and doors and illegally trespassed in the United States Capitol.\" \"I think it's a cop out to blame somebody other than the actual perpetrators of crimes, generally. So I don't like to take criminals off the hook too easily,\" Cramer added.  The end is near \u2014 at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.  The panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump. So here's what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations \u2014 never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term. Additional \"transcripts and documents\" will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said. The sheer volume of this material can't be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon. These upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump's critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump's allies \u2014 that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings. The current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that's when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\u00a0 Of the committee's nine members, four won't be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month. For months, the Jan. 6 committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn\u2019t equivocate. The committee referred Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, including:  Obstructing an official proceeding\nDefrauding the United States\nMaking false statements \nAssisting or aiding an insurrection The panel said in its executive summary that it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy. So what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee\u2019s final report \u2013 to be released Wednesday \u2013 will provide justification from the panel\u2019s investigation for recommending the charges. In practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation. But the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department\u2019s court. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said during Monday's meeting that he has \u201cevery confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\u2019ve provided to aid in their work.\u201d After the panel's meeting, Thompson told CNN that the evidence that supports the panel's decision to refer Trump to the DOJ is \"clear,\" adding that he is \"convinced\" that the department will ultimately charge Trump. CNN's Tierney Sneed contributed reporting to this post.  ##Referrals##  Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday's final public session. \u201cI think we were all involved in this dialogue from the beginning. And you know, the dialogue really started with two polls: those who thought perhaps we don\u2019t need to do any specifical referrals, the whole committee work product is a referral to the prosecutors and the people. And then there were those on the other end who said we should refer every single offense that we saw of any type no matter how central. But we ended up in the middle with the idea that we should focus on the central actors with the major offenses\u201d Raskin said.\u00a0 Asked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said \u201cas evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.\u201d However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel\u2019s investigation.\u00a0 In terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.\u201d ##Referrals## Check out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here. Jan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with \u201cabundant evidence\u201d against them. \u201cThere were undoubtedly other people involved, but we were stymied by virtue of a lot of people refusing to come and testify, refusing to give us the information they had or taking the Fifth Amendment. So we chose to advance the names of people where we felt certain that there was abundant evidence that they had participated in crimes, and so we're sending those over. It's not to the exclusion of anyone else,\" Raskin said after the panel's final meeting Monday. Raskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation. \u201cWe wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,\u201d he added. Schiff said, \u201cThe long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don't have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.\u201d Raskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department \u201cquickly,\" while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday. Asked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove. ##Referrals## After extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals \u2014 including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit. The final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday. Here are the key things that happened at the committee\u2019s last public session: Trump\u2019s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday\u2019s meeting, but the full report won\u2019t be available to the public until Wednesday.\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. \u201cI believe nearly two years\u00a0later, this is still a time of\u00a0reflection and reckoning,\" he said. \"If we are to survive as a nation\u00a0of laws and democracy, this can\u00a0never happen again.\" Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee\u2019s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was \u201cunfit for any office.\u201d ##Catch Up## As the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.  Law enforcement officers who testified at the panel\u2019s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had. Those officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt.\u00a0Aquilino Gonell\u00a0and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges. Fanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded. A number of committee staff and investigators \u2014\u00a0and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel\u2019s work \u2014 were in the audience as well.\u00a0 The meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress. In previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today\u2019s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking. The White House said the Jan. 6 committee has been doing \u201cimportant bipartisan work,\u201d but declined to offer any new response after the committee held its final public meeting on Monday.\u00a0 \u201cWe've been very clear from the beginning that what we saw on Jan. 6 was the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, and the President has been very clear our democracy continues and remains under threat,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing on Monday. \u201cWe all have a part to protect it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Jean-Pierre said the committee had \u201cbeen doing important bipartisan work to get to the truth of what happened on that very day so we can make sure that that doesn't happen again.\u201d\u00a0 Pressed for a response on referrals to the House Ethics Committee for four Republican members of Congress, Jean-Pierre declined to give a direct response from the White House. \u201cYou would have to ask those, those very Republicans... to speak for their own actions here and have them explain themselves,\u201d she said. Jan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson\u00a0said the evidence that supports the panel's decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is \"clear,\" adding that he is \"convinced\" that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump. \"The committee looked at it long\u00a0and hard, and from my vantage\u00a0point, we couldn't do anything\u00a0except make the referral,\" Thompson told CNN after Monday's meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral. \"It was clear in the evaluation\u00a0of the evidence uncovered by our\u00a0committee that those actions\u00a0taken by the president... former\u00a0President Trump, clearly created\u00a0a problem for this country,\" he added. The committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation \u2014 including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews. \"We think it's\u00a0important for the Justice\u00a0Department to look at that body\u00a0of information that we put\u00a0together,\" he said.  \"I'm convinced that now that our\u00a0committee has released our\u00a0information, they will take the\u00a0information that we've shared\u00a0with them and proceed with the\u00a0investigation,\" Thompson said referring to the ongoing DOJ investigation into Trump.\u00a0\"I have no doubt that once the\u00a0investigation proceeds and is\u00a0concluded, if the evidence is as\u00a0we presented it, I'm convinced\u00a0the Justice Department will\u00a0charge former President Trump.\u00a0No one \u2014\u00a0including a former\u00a0president \u2014 is above the law.\" ##Referrals## Watch: Trump \u201cminimized the seriousness of the attack\u201d in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump's former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\u00a0 \u201cThere's no doubt that President Trump thought that the actions of the rioters were justified. In the days after Jan. 6, he spoke to several different advisers. And in those conversations, he minimized the seriousness of the attack,\u201d Luria said before airing testimony from Conway.\u00a0 Asked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn't think it was very long. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.\u201d\u00a0 Trump, Conway said, responded to her saying, \"These people are upset. They\u2019re very upset.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 CNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being \u201cupset\u201d during a heated phone call he had with\u00a0House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u00a0while the insurrection was underway, claiming the\u00a0rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\u00a0 \u201cWell, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,\u201d Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, \u201cWho the f\u2013k do you think you are talking to?\u201d according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\u00a0 The Jan. 6 committee brought some focus on the\u00a0consequences of former President Donald Trump's lies for \"regular people,\" CNN's Audie Cornish said after the committee's final public meeting, including the \"election workers who\u00a0suffered because they were caught up in a vortex of lies\u00a0and the conspiracy theories.\" \"Even the insurrectionists\u00a0who have gone to say, 'I went\u00a0because the president told me to go,'\" she added.  \"These lives have been affected.\u00a0Hundreds of people have faced charges from\u00a0the DOJ.\u00a0I think for us, it's like legal theory\u00a0still. But lots of people's\u00a0lives were really torn apart by\u00a0that day,\" she said on CNN.  \"I think it was\u00a0valuable for the committee to\u00a0acknowledge and underscore that\u00a0in its final meeting,\" Cornish added. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol\u00a0has concluded that former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes. The summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn\u2019t willing to help him overturn his election defeat \u2014 while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee\u2019s investigation. The committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump\u2019s intent: that he \u201cpurposely disseminated false allegations of fraud\u201d in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. \u201cThese false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.\u201d The full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation. Here are some key things from the report summary: Committee referring Trump and others to DOJ: The House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump\u2019s defeat and says there\u2019s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and \u201cothers.\u201d The report summary says there\u2019s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy. Trump's false victory was \"premeditated\": The committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway. Several members of Congress being referred to House Ethics Committee: The select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas. ##Report Summary## The Jan. 6 committee voted to approve its final report and criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump Monday.  While the full report won't be available to the public until Wednesday, the panel released an executive summary following its meeting. The summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn\u2019t willing to help him overturn his election defeat \u2013 while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful.\u00a0 Read the executive summary here: ##Report Summary## The House select committee is referring four members of Congress to the House\u2019s Ethics Committee after those members did not comply with the subpoenas from the panel. Rep. Jamie Raskin,\u00a0who announced the referrals at Monday\u2019s public meeting, said they were being referred for \u201cappropriate sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas.\u201d\u00a0 An executive summary released after the meeting identifies the four Republicans as: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. CNN has reached out to all four GOP members who were referred to House Ethics for defying the committee's subpoenas.  \u201cThis is just another partisan and political stunt made by a Select Committee that knowingly altered evidence, blocked minority representation on a Committee for the first time in the history of the US House of Representatives, and failed to respond to Mr. Jordan\u2019s numerous letters and concerns surrounding the politicization and legitimacy of the Committee\u2019s work,\" Russell Dye, spokesperson for Rep. Jim Jordan, told CNN.  ##Referrals## The House Jan. 6 committee voted Monday to approve its historic final committee report and refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department on multiple criminal charges for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\u00a0 The committee voted unanimously at the end of its final public meeting Monday to adopt the report and criminal referrals for Trump and others. The final report won't be released publicly until Wednesday. The committee referred Trump to the Justice Department for obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the US, making false statements and giving aid or comfort to an insurrection, the panel said Monday. The committee said at Monday's hearing that there is sufficient evidence to refer Trump on those four potential crimes. Committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said that those \"are not the only statutes that are potentially relevant to President Trump\u2019s conduct related to the 2020 election\u201d and that \"depending on evidence developed by the Department of Justice, the President\u2019s actions could certainly trigger other criminal violations.\" The committee said it was also advancing criminal referrals for attorney John Eastman and \"others\" to the Justice Department for investigation and potential prosecution. There is evidence to justify an Eastman referral to DOJ on obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States, the committee said Monday.\u00a0Raskin said that the committee believed the conduct of others may also warrant Justice Department investigation and prosecution, but those referrals were not identified\u00a0on Monday. \"Our report describes in detail the actions of numerous co-conspirators who agreed with, and participated in, Trump\u2019s plan to impair, obstruct and defeat the certification of President Biden\u2019s electoral victory,\" Raskin said. \"That said, the subcommittee does not attempt to determine all of the potential participants in this conspiracy, as our understanding of the role of many individuals may be incomplete even today because they refused to answer our questions. We trust that the Department of Justice will be able to form a more complete picture through its investigation.\" ##Referrals## In the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors\u00a0about\u00a0the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\u00a0 Murphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks,\u00a0Trump's\u00a0former\u00a0communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley\u00a0discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump \u201creally should tweet something about Being NON-violent.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Hicks responded that she had already \u201csuggested it several times\u201d without success.\u00a0 In a recorded\u00a0interview played by the committee on Monday, Hicks said, \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to the President about this directly, but I communicated with people like [Trump White House lawyer] Eric Herschmann that it was my view that it was important that the President put out some kind of message in advance of the event\u201d about being peaceful.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,\u201d Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\u00a0 Despite his staff\u2019s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to \u201cfight like hell,\u201d and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\u00a0 The House Select Committee announced at Monday\u2019s meeting it was recommending criminal referrals to the Justice Department as part of its investigation into Jan. 6. \u201cOurs is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,\u201d said Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat who sits on the committee. The committee chose to advance referrals because of \u201cwhere the gravity of the specific offense, the severity of its actual harm, and the centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election, compel us to speak,\u201d he added.\u00a0 As a starting point, the committee relied on opinions issued by a federal judge in California, who determined emails to and from Trump attorney John Eastman showed evidence of a crime. That legal ruling allowed the committee to pierce the privileges that typically would have shielded them from view.\u00a0 \u201cThe judge concluded that both former President Donald Trump and John Eastman likely violated two federal criminal statutes,\u201d Raskin said.\u00a0 ##Referrals##  Watch:  The Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral\u00a0it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.  CNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against  Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. The full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee\u2019s recommendations. Remember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee\u2019s final report \u2013 to be released Wednesday \u2013 will provide justification from the panel\u2019s investigation for recommending the charges. But any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With\u00a0the federal investigation\u00a0now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted. ##Referrals## House Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday's public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.  \"The witness believed this was an effort to affect her testimony, and we are concerned that these efforts may have been a strategy to prevent the committee from finding the truth,\" Lofgren said.\u00a0 Lofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn't learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\u00a0\u00a0 \"One lawyer told a witness the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the committee that she didn't recall facts when she actually did recall them. That lawyer also did not disclose who was paying for the lawyer's representation, despite questions from the client seeking that information,\" Lofgren said. \"We've learned that a client was offered potential employment that would make her, quote, financially very comfortable as the date of her testimony approached by entities that were apparently linked to Donald Trump and his associates.\"\u00a0\u00a0 As it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated. Lofgren didn't name the lawyer or the female witness, and it's not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\u00a0 It's not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\u00a0 \u00a0 In a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: \u201cI was becoming increasingly concerned that ... we were damaging his legacy.\u201d Trump \"said something along the lines of, you know, \u2018Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,\u2019\u201d Hicks said in the clip. The committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel \u201chas obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,\u201d Lofgren later continued.\u00a0 GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s of the utmost importance that our Department of Justice operates as a fair and neutral body, that enforces our federal laws without fear or without favor,\u201d Kinzinger said during Monday's public meeting. \u201cIt is this critical function that President Trump sought to corrupt, as he sought to use the Department to investigate and prosecute purported election fraud, and to help him convince the public that the election was stolen.\u201d Kinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to \u201cjust say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,\u201d according to committee testimony.\u00a0 A retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump\u2019s scheming at the Justice Department.\u00a0\u00a0 When then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump\u2019s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,\u201d Kinzinger said. Watch: Former President Donald Trump \u201coversaw\u201d an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory in key swing states,\u00a0the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday. The panel highlighted Trump\u2019s personal involvement in the\u00a0legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors\u00a0in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to \u201ctransmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.\u201d Those certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team\u2019s attempt to subvert the\u00a0Electoral\u00a0College.\u00a0\u00a0 As part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these \u201cfalse ballots\u201d were created despite concerns among Trump\u2019s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be \u201cunlawful.\u201d \u201cThe false ballots were created by fake Republican electors on December 14th, at the same time the actual, certified electors in those States were meeting to cast their votes for President Biden.\u00a0By that point in time, election-related litigation was over in all or nearly all of these states, and Trump Campaign election lawyers realized that the fake slates were unjustifiable on any grounds, and may be unlawful,\u201d committee member Rep. Adam Schiff said. \u201cIn spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The committee has evidence that shows these \u201cintentionally false\u201d Electoral College certificates were \u201ctransmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,\u201d according to Schiff.\u00a0 Evidence collected by the committee also shows these documents \u201cwere intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called \u2018competing slates\u2019 of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,\u201d he added. \u00a0\u00a0 Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the House select committee, said the panel \u201cfound that Mr. Trump raised hundreds of millions of dollars with false representations made to his online donors. The proceeds from this fundraising, we have learned, have been used in ways that we believe are concerning.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn particular, the committee has learned some of those funds were used to hire lawyers,\u201d the California Democrat said.\u00a0\u00a0 One such lawyer told a witness that the individual \u201ccould, in certain circumstances, tell the committee that she didn\u2019t recall facts when she actually did recall them,\u201d\u00a0Lofgren added, but did not name the witness or the lawyer. The same lawyer, Lofgren said, declined to answer questions from that witness about who was paying for the lawyer\u2019s representation.\u00a0 Watch: Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\u00a0 \u201cNo man who would behave that\u00a0way at that moment in time can\u00a0ever serve in any position of\u00a0authority in our nation again.\u00a0He is unfit for any office,\u201d the Republican from Wyoming said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by\u00a0President Trump that the 2020\u00a0election was stolen by overwhelming fraud.\u00a0And we also knew this was flatly\u00a0false. We knew that dozens of state\u00a0and federal judges had\u00a0addressed and resolved all\u00a0manner of allegations about the\u00a0election,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cOur legal system functioned as it\u00a0should.\u00a0But our president would not\u00a0accept the outcome.\u00a0Among the most shameful of this\u00a0committee's findings was that\u00a0President Trump sat in the\u00a0dining room off the Oval Office\u00a0watching the violent riot at\u00a0the Capitol on television.\u201d\u00a0 She went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by \u201curgent pleas\u201d from people around him to \u201cissue a\u00a0public statement instructing\u00a0his supporters to disperse and\u00a0leave the Capitol,\" even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\u00a0 \u201cIn addition to being unlawful\u00a0as described in our report,\u00a0this was an utter moral\u00a0failure, and a clear dereliction of\u00a0duty,\u201d Cheney added.\u00a0 GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is \"at the heart of our Republic.\" \"Members of Congress are reminded\u00a0of this every day, as we pass\u00a0through the Capitol rotunda.\u00a0There, eight magnificent\u00a0paintings detail the earliest\u00a0days of our Republic,\" she said Monday at the final meeting of the committee. \"One painted by John Trumbull\u00a0depicts the moment in 1793, when\u00a0George Washington resigned his\u00a0commission, handing control of\u00a0the continental army back to Congress.\" She added: \"Trumbull called this 'one\u00a0of the highest moral lessons\u00a0ever given the world.'\u00a0With this noble act, George\u00a0Washington established the\u00a0indispensable example of the\u00a0peace transfer of power in our nation.\" She traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty. Watch:  Jan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday's public meeting.  \"The future of our democracy\u00a0rests in your hands.\u00a0It's up to the people of this\u00a0country to decide who deserves the\u00a0public trust.\u00a0Who will put fidelity to the\u00a0Constitution and democracy above\u00a0all else. Who will abide by the rule of\u00a0law \u2014 no matter the outcome,\" Thompson said.  He also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee's hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.  \"I'm grateful to the millions of\u00a0you who followed this committee's work.\u00a0I hope we lived up to our\u00a0commitment to present the facts\u00a0\u2014 and let the facts speak for themselves,\" Thompson said.  He continued, \"Let me say in closing, the women\u00a0and men seated around me on this\u00a0dais are public servants in the\u00a0most genuine sense.\u00a0They put aside politician and\u00a0partisanship, to ensure the\u00a0success of this committee, and\u00a0providing answers to the\u00a0American people.\"  Thompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. \"I especially want to thank and\u00a0acknowledge our vice chair, who\u00a0has become a true partner in\u00a0this bipartisan effort, Ms.\u00a0Cheney of Wyoming.\"  Jan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson\u00a0said the panel's findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still \"reckoning\" left to do, nearly two years later. \"We remain in strange and uncharted waters,\" Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.  \u201cI believe nearly two years\u00a0later, this is still a time of\u00a0reflection and reckoning,\" he added. \"If we are to survive as a nation\u00a0of laws and democracy, this can\u00a0never happen again.\" In opening statements to the committee's final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results. \u201cIf the faith is broken, so is our democracy,\" he said. \u201cDonald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.\" \u201cIn the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,\u201d he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were \u201carmed and angry.\u201d Thompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday. Along with adopting its final report on Monday,\u00a0the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against\u00a0Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously\u00a0reported. \"There's one factor I believe is\u00a0most important in preventing\u00a0another January 6\u00a0\u2014\u00a0accountability,\" Thompson said.  \"So, today, beyond our findings,\u00a0we will also show that evidence\u00a0we've gathered points to further\u00a0action beyond the power of this\u00a0committee, or the Congress, to\u00a0help ensure\u00a0accountability\u00a0under\u00a0law,\" he added.  \"Accountability\u00a0that can only be\u00a0found in the criminal justice\u00a0system.\u00a0We have every confidence that\u00a0the work of this committee will\u00a0help provide a roadmap to\u00a0justice,\" he said.  Thompson didn\u2019t announce the criminal referrals in his opening\u00a0statement\u00a0but said that the panel has \u201cevery confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\u2019ve provided to aid in their work.\u201d CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.  House select committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson told CNN that the Jan. 6 committee will send the criminal referrals to the Justice Department \u201cshortly after we take care of business today.\u201d There are \u201cno plans\u201d as of yet to meet with special counsel Jack Smith, he added. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting. The panel is expected to announce\u00a0criminal referrals\u00a0to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won\u2019t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January. The meeting \u2014 which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses \u2014 will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week. CNN previously reported\u00a0the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of\u00a0Trump\u2019s closest allies. The committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021. The Jan. 6 committee\u2019s expected referrals to the Justice Department alleging Donald Trump committed at least three crimes includes one for insurrection, sources have told CNN.\u00a0 The Civil War-era law has rarely been used, and it's one prosecutors have viewed as problematic in their Jan. 6 investigations. The 2383 statute reads:\u00a0Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. Justice Department prosecutors have weighed using the statute in their investigations of hundreds of people so far charged in the US Capitol attack.\u00a0 But no one has been charged with insurrection.\u00a0 An official involved in some of the internal decisions on Jan. 6 says officials viewed the insurrection law as challenging because there\u2019s very little case law, raising the likelihood that prosecution could fail. Prosecutors have instead chosen another rarely used law: seditious conspiracy. A Washington jury convicted members of the Oath Keepers of seditious conspiracy last month. The other possible referrals against Trump, obstruction of a congressional proceeding and defrauding the US government are more commonly prosecuted. ##Referrals## The House Jan. 6 select committee has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, including several within former President Donald Trump's orbit, CNN's Pamela Brown reports.  In this Magic Wall segment, Brown highlights the key witnesses linked to the former president including Bill Barr, Ivanka Trump and Pat Cipollone.  Watch:  The House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power. Through blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president\u2019s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6. On Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report \u2013 spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday \u2013 as well as present\u00a0criminal referrals\u00a0it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel\u2019s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note. The charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney\u00a0John Eastman\u00a0in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman\u2019s emails. The final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges. The panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump,\u00a0CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that \u201cthe gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.\u201d Raskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel\u2019s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday. A possible complication from the final Jan. 6 committee\u2019s public meeting and the release of transcripts could come at the federal courthouse across from the Capitol where five leaders of the Proud Boys are on trial beginning today on seditious conspiracy. Lawyers for defendants including Enrique Tarrio, have argued that the committee\u2019s public activity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial. A federal judge delayed their trial this summer, agreeing with the defense\u2019s concerns. Defense attorneys have raised renewed concerns about the committee\u2019s meeting today and the final report to be released this week.\u00a0\u00a0 Judge Timothy Kelly has said the trial will continue.\u00a0\u201cWe just have to take it as it comes and roll with it,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump\u2019s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals \u2014 attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen \u2014a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.  Sources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee\u2019s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\u00a0 \u201cWe know this is happening, and we need to be prepared to publicly deal with it,\u201d one source close to the former president said.\u00a0 Many of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\u00a0 While some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.  In a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of \u201cillegally leaking confidential info\u201d and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\u00a0 He also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for\u00a0protestors to be \u201cpeaceful.\u201d During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of \u201cpeace\u201d in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\u00a0 The criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\u00a0\u00a0 For Justice Department investigators, more important than the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee, is obtaining the evidence the committee gathered \u2014 notably the transcripts of thousands of hours of interviews with witnesses.\u00a0 Justice officials have pushed for access to interview transcripts for months, and the committee announced that it would turn over a limited number of witness interviews over the summer.\u00a0 But to the frustration of prosecutors and US Attorney General Merrick Garland, the committee largely has held on to most of its evidence.\u00a0 Investigators have closely monitored the committee\u2019s public presentations, but much has changed in the Justice Department probes of Trump since the last hearing.\u00a0 In August, the FBI carried out an extraordinary search of the former president\u2019s home to recover thousands of pages of government documents, including national security material classified at the highest levels. That action revealed the existence of a second Trump investigation, for alleged illegal retention of classified documents and obstruction.\u00a0 And now, special counsel Jack Smith overseeing both two Trump investigations. As the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say. \u201cThe point of this meeting will be simple and sober,\u201d one source told CNN.\u00a0 Today\u2019s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.  Unlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today\u2019s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021. \u201cNobody\u2019s spiking the football here,\u201d Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\u00a0 The Jan. 6 committee is treating today\u2019s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a \u201croadmap\u201d for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\u00a0 The committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\u00a0 Lawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies \u2014 from state bars to the House ethics committee. Congressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\u00a0 Lawmakers on Capitol Hill reached an agreement to include legislation in a must-pass spending bill to make it harder to overturn a certified presidential election when a joint session of Congress meets to approve the results, according to Hill sources. The legislation \u2014 to overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act \u2014 would be the first that is expected to be signed into law as a direct response to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. The bill would ensure the vice president's role is completely ceremonial, raise the threshold in Congress for forcing votes to overturn a certified result and try to prevent efforts to pass along fake electors to Congress.  The Jan. 6 committee is expected to call for the bill\u2019s passage, according to another source. The bill is a result of intense negotiations that won over the support of top Republicans, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, but has drawn pushback from House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\u00a0 As the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President\u00a0Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say. Despite the many probes facing\u00a0Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\u00a0 One thing\u00a0Trump\u2019s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to\u00a0Trump. Trump\u00a0advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\u00a0 However, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\u00a0 As of now,\u00a0Trump\u2019s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds. ##Referrals## Republicans in the House are preparing their counteroffensive to the exhaustive investigation by the Jan. 6 committee, finalizing a report focusing on security failures at the Capitol complex and steering clear of former President Donald Trump. A senior GOP aide said Republicans will wait for the Jan. 6 committee to put out its report first but are prepared to release theirs soon after. It\u2019s unclear if it will come out today. The aide said the focus will be on: \u201cWhy was the Capitol so unprepared and how do we make sure that won\u2019t happen again?\u201d More on this: For much of the past two years, Republicans have tried to pin the blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, even though she is not in charge of day-to-day security decisions at the Capitol. Republicans expect Pelosi to factor into their final report as well. In the new GOP majority, Republicans are not expected to make investigating the Jan. 6 investigators a heavy focus of their oversight efforts, despite previous suggestions that they would. But they may look into how the Jan. 6 committee spent its money, including by hiring a former TV executive to help produce the hearings, aides said. The Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department,\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0last week. According to a source familiar with the matter, they include:  Insurrection\nObstruction of an official proceeding \nConspiracy to defraud the federal government For the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on\u00a0an opinion from a federal judge\u00a0in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman. The judge cited emails discussing Trump\u2019s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings. A House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It\u2019s a crime to assist or engage in \u201cin any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.\u201d Judges have used the term \u201cinsurrection\u201d to describe the January 6 attack on Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 presidential election. But the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy. Who else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump\u2019s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources\u00a0told CNN\u00a0earlier this month. Another source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized. CNN's Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.  ##Referrals## Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee\u00a0investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas. \u201cWe will also be considering what\u2019s the appropriate remedy for members of Congress who ignore a congressional subpoena, as well as the evidence that was so pertinent to our investigation and why we wanted to bring them in,\u201d the California Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Schiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should \u201cpolice its own.\u201d Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee. Five House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. The select committee is set to\u00a0hold its final public hearing\u00a0today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government,\u00a0according to a source familiar with the matter. The impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot. But in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals. \u201cCensure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,\u201d Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday. CNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump\u2019s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources. ##Referrals## Nearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol,\u00a0the House select committee\u00a0tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand. The panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday. Unlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday\u2019s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify. What to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer\u00a0at least three criminal charges\u00a0against\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0to the Justice Department. The committee will release an executive summary of the investigation\u2019s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel\u2019s investigation for recommending the charges. Why now?\u00a0Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January. The House select committee\u2019s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the\u00a0US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Here's a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:  The committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump\u2019s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. \u201cI think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,\" she said. \nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel\u2019s hearing in October.

The committee sent out dozens of subpoenas seeking call logs, including to major phone companies, as part of its investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. But several Trump allies sued, contesting the committee\u2019s authority, and Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile agreed not to turn over any data to the House while those lawsuits were litigated in court. Few of the cases have been resolved. That means the House select committee will not be able to incorporate in its final report some of the information it long sought about the communications of top witnesses around Donald Trump and the White House in late 2020 and January 2021. The panel plans to release the report next week. Last week, the committee withdrew its phone-records subpoenas related to Trump adviser\u00a0Sebastian Gorka, White House aide\u00a0Stephen Miller, elections attorney\u00a0Cleta Mitchell, conservative political activist\u00a0Roger Stone, some Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants and\u00a0Amy Harris, a photojournalist who spent time with top members of the Proud Boys around Jan. 6, 2021, according to filings in seven House subpoena challenges that were pending in the DC District Court. \u201cOn December 12, 2022, Plaintiffs were informed by counsel for the Select Committee that the Select Committee will be withdrawing the subject subpoena issued by the Committee,\u201d one court filing, from lawyers representing members of the Oath Keepers extremist group, wrote in one recent request to drop a lawsuit. Some of the subpoenas were issued a year ago.The committee declined to comment. While these witnesses and some others successfully blocked the committee from obtaining their phone records, the panel was able to access unprecedented amounts of information in their investigation, including through other phone records subpoenas, other document requests and witness interviews. Some of that information was on display in a series of public hearings over the summer. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday's meeting. What this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing. Committee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation \u2013 not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN. Thompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals. Thompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals. Thompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday\u2019s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals. A subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee\u2019s recommendations. CNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to\u00a0former President Donald Trump, ##Referrals## The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee\u2019s probe since the panel formed in July 2021. Supporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden's win.\u00a0 Here's how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump\u2019s speech:\u00a0 At 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\u00a0\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers \"traitors\" for doing their jobs.\u00a0\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\u00a0\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\u00a0\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\u00a0\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC's 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\u00a0\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business \u2014 namely, confirming Biden's win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\u00a0\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence \u2014 who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary \u2014 bringing the Senate session back into order.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\u00a0 Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the \"United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.\"\u00a0 It took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden's election win.\u00a0 See the full timeline of events here.\u00a0 ##Catch Up## Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel\u2019s full report will come out December 21. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel\u2019s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later. \u201cWe will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,\u201d Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report. Members of the committee have promised to have the committee\u2019s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.

Aside from the Jan. 6 committee's probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:  Tax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president\u2019s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee's chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.  Mar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed\u00a0special counsel Jack Smith\u00a0to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump\u2019s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The\u00a0Justice Department investigation\u00a0continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents. 2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the\u00a0so-called quiet period\u00a0leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses. Meanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump\u2019s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the election results. Trump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation,\u00a0sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization\u00a0in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself. James alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.

Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.  The committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\u00a0 Rep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\u00a0 Here's who is on the panel: Democrats:\u00a0 Chair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\u00a0\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\nRep. Adam Schiff of California Republicans\u00a0 Vice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at\u00a0its final public meeting\u00a0on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department. So what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee\u2019s final report \u2013 to be released Wednesday \u2013 will provide justification from the panel\u2019s investigation for recommending the charges. But any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With\u00a0the federal investigation\u00a0now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted. But whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions. In addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six\u00a0other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals. CNN's Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.  \u00a0##Referrals## Michael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would like to see the Department of Justice indict the former president and those with whom their investigation determined that criminal statutes were violated,\u201d Fanone told CNN on Monday. Fanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection. \u201cI would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I've said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,\u201d he said. Fanone also said he is \u201chopeful\u201d the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\u00a0 When the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate\u00a0conclusion\u00a0to the public this week \u2013 holding a final public\u00a0meeting\u00a0on Monday and announcing\u00a0expected\u00a0criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday \u2013 the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department. For much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel\u2019s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ. And those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week. One White House official told CNN ahead of the committee\u2019s upcoming last\u00a0meeting\u00a0on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House\u2019s efforts this year to avoid \u201crunning pundit\u201d on the panel\u2019s work. But officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee\u2019s work, not to mention his rejection of last year\u2019s insurrection and the threats to the country\u2019s democratic systems.\u00a0 Indeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections \u2013 that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\u00a0 And in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,\u201d Biden said this summer. In October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as \u201cabsolutely devastating.\u201d\u00a0 The House select committee investigating\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0to the Justice Department, according to a source familiar with the matter. The charges include:  Insurrection\nObstruction of an official proceeding \nConspiracy to defraud the federal government The committee\u2019s final recommendations could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. The referral recommendations will be presented at a committee meeting on Monday and the final report will provide justification from the panel\u2019s investigation for recommending the charges. The impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. But in addition to criminal referrals, committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals. More on the charges: The charging recommendations under consideration\u00a0of obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government match\u00a0allegations the select committee made\u00a0against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman\u2019s emails. A judge had agreed with the House, finding it could access Eastman\u2019s emails about his 2020 election work for Trump because the pair was likely planning to defraud the US and engaging in a conspiracy to obstruct Congress, according to that court proceeding. The Guardian was\u00a0first to report\u00a0on the committee\u2019s consideration of the charges. Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, criticized the committee in a statement as a \u201cKangaroo court\u201d that held \u201cshow trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country\u2019s history.\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the committee, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Friday that the panel has \u201cbeen very careful in crafting these recommendations and tethering them to the facts that we\u2019ve uncovered.\u201d \u201cWe spent a huge amount of time not just on what the code sections are and the bottom line recommendation, but the facts \u2013 and I think it\u2019s really important when we discuss whatever it is we are going to do and we\u2019ll have a vote on it, that people understand the facts behind the conclusions we reach,\u201d the California Democrat said on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d The Justice Department has largely focused on criminal statutes related to the violence, for obstructing a congressional proceeding and in some limited cases for seditious conspiracy, when charging defendants in connection with the attack on the US Capitol. ##Referrals## The House select committee investigating Jan. 6 will release an executive summary of the investigation\u2019s final report on Monday after the 1 p.m. ET meeting, a committee aide said Sunday.\u00a0 \u201cFollowing the business meeting, the Select Committee is expected to release certain materials, including an executive summary of the report, details on referrals, and additional information about witnesses who have appeared before the committee,\u201d a committee aide said. As CNN previously reported, the committee will also be releasing the entire report on Wednesday."

  "title": "Opinion: It's time for Marjorie Taylor Greene to go",
  "date": "2022-12-13T10:49:12Z",
  "text": "What should a political party do when one of their elected members to Congress is making comments that sound awfully traitorous? That's the question the Republican Party should be grappling with right now in the aftermath of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia saying this weekend that, if she had organized the January 6, 2021, riots, the insurrectionists would have won. \"I gotta tell you something: If Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won,\" she reportedly told the New York Young Republican Club. \"Not to mention, it would have been armed.\" It's hard to overstate how offensive and scary this is. In a statement to CNN on Monday, Greene said she was being sarcastic and, as she has done previously, denied any involvement in the January 6 riot. \"My comments were making fun of Joe Biden and the Democrats, who have continuously made me a political target since January 6th,\" she said. Her statement is nonsensical to the point that one has to wonder whether Greene knows what the word \"sarcastic\" means. Her comments were not making fun of Biden or the Democrats; they were making a mockery of the country. The January 6 insurrection was an attempt to violently overthrow the government and overturn the results of a free and fair American election. Close to 1,000 of the participants have since been indicted, and many have been convicted of serious crimes. Four people died that day, and five officers died in the days and weeks that followed, while more than 100 law enforcement officers were injured.  Members of Congress \u2014 Greene's colleagues \u2014 wound up running for their lives, hiding from the mobbing criminals who broke into the Capitol and explicitly threatened the lives of House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence. It's time for Greene to go. Removing a member of Congress from office is not a decision that a party should take lightly. She was, after all, duly elected by her constituents. But a requirement of serving in elected office is defending the Constitution of the United States.  In a few weeks, Greene will even lay her hand on a Bible and pledge to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\" How can she truly swear that oath when she is cheering on domestic enemies? This is not the first time the United States has been forced to grapple with enemies from within. Tellingly, some of the January 6 rioters flew not just the US flag but also the traitorous Confederate banner \u2014 the flag of earlier enemies of the nation, who were, thankfully, defeated. No right-thinking person should want another bloody war that splits this country apart. But unfortunately, too many people on the political right want just that. At the same Young Republican gala where Greene spoke, the group's president, Gavin Wax, reportedly told the audience, \"We want to cross the Rubicon. We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.\" He then added, \"This is the only language the left understands. The language of pure and unadulterated power.\" This is truly terrifying stuff. It's one thing to wage war at the ballot box, but quite another to encourage battle \"in the streets.\" This kind of rhetoric, coupled with Greene's comments, is especially troubling considering that some members of the January 6 crowd were indeed armed and dangerous. As devastating as that day was, it could have been far, far worse.  That a Republican member of Congress suggests that she not only wanted that insurrection to be more violent, but she believes that the insurrectionists should have won \u2014 should have overturned an election by force \u2014 demonstrates just how dangerous and deranged some members of the GOP have become.  It's up to the party now to get its act together. Republicans have long flirted with right-wing extremism, and former President Donald Trump opened up the floodgates, helping to reshape a portion of the GOP into a party of conspiracy theorists, racists, antisemites, gun nuts and election deniers. Many members of the party, at best, held their noses and, at worst, embraced these deplorables because the election wins were coming in. But now they're reaping what they sowed: a party that, up to the highest levels, is populated by people who put power over country \u2014- and who are now straightforwardly saying that they wouldn't just be happy to see American democracy burn, they'd be on the front lines. This is not a matter of simple political disagreement, such as a debate over appropriate taxation rates or how best to structure our immigration laws. It's not even a deep divide in values and morals, such as whether abortion should be legal or how to balance anti-discrimination laws with religious freedoms. This is the kind of fundamental question that transcends partisanship. It's one of fidelity to the nation itself, and to the once-radical idea of America as a representative and pluralistic democracy. Greene's comments are among the most anti-American ever uttered by an elected official in my lifetime. They are nothing less than someone happy to foment insurrection and undermine this country's most basic democratic traditions in an effort to install the losing candidate just because she shares his ideology. They are the words of a woman who will, on January 3, be lying when she places her hand on a Bible and swears that she is loyal to the Constitution. If the Republican Party has any shred of dignity left, and any vanishing claim to patriotism and devotion to the United States, it needs to act and make Greene the pariah any enemy of the state should be."

  "date": "2022-12-12T18:09:55Z",
  "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said over the weekend that if she had led the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that \"we would have won\" and that people would have been \"armed.\" \"I come to Washington, I swear in on January 3, I get accused of giving insurrection tours which I thought was hilarious because I couldn't even find the bathroom in the Capitol. True story,\" Greene, a Georgia Republican, said while speaking at an event by the New York Young Republican Club, according to video posted by the Twitter user @patriottakes. \"Then January 6 happens, and next thing you know, I organized the whole thing along with Steve Bannon here. And I gotta tell you something: If Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. Not to mention, it would have been armed. Yeah. See, that's the whole joke isn't it?\" Greene continued, \"They say that whole thing was planned and I'm like, 'Are you kidding me?' A bunch of conservatives, Second Amendment supporters went in the Capitol without guns and they think we organized that? I don't think so.\" In a statement to CNN on Monday, Greene said she was being sarcastic and, as she has done previously, denied any involvement in the January 6 riot.  \"My comments were making fun of Joe Biden and the Democrats, who have continuously made me a political target since January 6th,\" she said. Greene, whose public image has been built largely on her willingness to make inflammatory statements and embrace fringe conspiracy theories, has previously tried to justify the deadly insurrection and downplayed it as \"just a riot.\" But many rioters who were at the US Capitol that day carried weapons such as bats and poles, and several carried guns, including one rioter who had two loaded handguns and was sentenced to five years in jail. Greene's latest comments are also notable given the prospect that she will return to committee assignments in the Republican-controlled House next year, and former President Donald Trump's determination to make the ideologies behind the Capitol riot a central theme of his new presidential campaign. But although she has tried to publicly downplay the deadly insurrection, text messages from her to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows obtained by CNN that were handed over to the January 6 committee show her pleading for Trump to stop the violence that day. \"Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol[.] Please tell the President to calm people[.] This isn't the way to solve anything,\" she texted. The White House on Monday condemned Greene's comments, calling it \"violent rhetoric\" and a \"slap in the face\" to law enforcement and families who lost loved ones defending the US Capitol that day. \"It goes against our fundamental values as a country for a Member of Congress to wish that the carnage of January 6th had been even worse, and to boast that she would have succeeded in an armed insurrection against the United States government,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN."

  "title": "Proud Boys want DC police officer to testify in their defense at upcoming trial",
  "date": "2022-12-03T04:13:06Z",
  "text": "Lawyers for Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio revealed in court Friday that they plan to argue during their December seditious conspiracy trial that the far-right extremist group was in touch with law enforcement about their plans to rally in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021.   Tarrio spoke with Metropolitan Police Lt. Shane Lamond several times about the group's plans to attend rallies in the district around the time of the 2020 election, according to Nayib Hassan, an attorney for Tarrio. Hassan said he wants to call Lamond as a defense witness. \"How can there be sedition if they're informing law enforcement\" of their plans? Hassan asked District Judge Timothy Kelly during a pretrial conference Friday.     Hassan said the officer had been threatened by the Justice Department with obstruction charges if he decides to testify to communications he had with Tarrio because his testimony \"would completely and totally destroy [the DOJ's] case.\"     Prosecutor Erik Kenerson categorically denied the allegation, telling Kelly the idea that \"the government has somehow threatened witnesses ... all of that is just categorically false.\" Kenerson said witnesses \"don't belong\" to defense attorneys or prosecutors and that defense counsel has known about the government's contacts with Lamond for months.   Tarrio and four other members of the Proud Boys are set to go on trial on December 19 for charges relating to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including seditious conspiracy. All five have pleaded not guilty. According to sources familiar with the matter, DC Police placed Lamond on administrative leave in February 2022. DC Police told CNN on Friday that Lamond is still on administrative leave but would not comment on the reasons why.  \"Lt. Lamond has dedicated his life to fighting the illegal conduct that occurred on January 6th and is adamantly opposed to those who stoke fear and hatred and denounces the violent conduct of all those who supported the insurrection and attacked our city and our nation on January 6th,\" Lamond's attorney, Mark Schamel, said in a statement. \"Lt. Lamond's decorated career has been to protect this city and this nation and he has never done anything to assist the criminals who attacked our democracy on January 6th,\" Schamel added. Tarrio told CNN at the time Lamond was placed on leave that he viewed Lamond as his DC Police \"liaison\" and was in touch with Lamond \"anytime [Proud Boys] went to rally in DC.\"   \"It is ridiculous to say that he was doing something improper. He literally was keeping two groups from clashing with one another by letting me know where Antifa or BLM protesters were so that we could avoid running into them,\" Tarrio told CNN in a February interview. \"Isn't having communication to prevent violence what community policing is all about?\" "

  "text": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection interviewed Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Wednesday in a sign the panel is interested in learning about potential efforts Donald Trump took to overturn the 2020 presidential election even long after President Joe Biden took office. \"Today I met with the January 6th Select Committee after previously receiving a subpoena for my testimony,\" Vos said in a statement Wednesday night. \"I did not have any involvement with the events of January 6, 2021. My meeting with the Select Committee was brief, and I answered their questions regarding Wisconsin's 2020 Presidential Election.\" The interview comes after the Republican lawmaker sued the panel in September to try and block the subpoena for his testimony. Vos said in the suit that the committee wanted to question him about a conversation he had with former President Donald Trump in July after the state courts blocked the use of some absentee ballot drop boxes, and Trump \"requested Speaker Vos take future actions.\" \"The Committee is demanding Speaker Vos appear for a deposition to answer questions irrelevant to the Committee's investigation, with virtually no notice, in the closing days of his reelection campaign, merely because of the Committee's public relations scheme,\" his lawsuit says. Vos tried to challenge the House committee's authority in court and argued the subpoena \"seeks to infringe on Speaker Vos' legislative immunity\" from lawsuits. Similar lawsuits from other House witnesses had not been successful or had not been decided yet. Vos' Wednesday interview was first reported by NBC News. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments Wednesday."

  "text": "The Justice Department has determined that the death of a US Capitol Police officer by suicide in the days following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol occurred in the line of duty and qualifies for line-of-duty death benefits, the officer's family said in a statement Monday. Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood died by suicide on January 9, 2021. His widow, Serena Liebengood, had been calling for US Capitol Police to declare her husband's death in the line of duty, in the days and months following the attack so that she could continue to receive health and financial benefits. \"We were recently notified that the Department of Justice officially determined our beloved family member U.S. Capitol Police Officer (USCP) Howie Liebengood's passing was in the line of duty under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program. The determination is significant, healing, relieving, and we are grateful for it,\" his family said in a statement. Liebengood's widow recounted in an open letter how he was ordered to remain on duty \"practically around the clock\" for three days after the Capitol attack, and how he was \"severely sleep deprived\" before his January 9 suicide. \"After assisting riot control at the Capitol on January 6th, USCP scheduled Howie to work lengthy shifts in the immediate days following. He was home for very few hours over the course of four days,\" she wrote. \"Although he was severely sleep-deprived, he remained on duty- as he was directed- practically around the clock from January 6th through the 9th. On the evening of the 9th, he took his life at our home.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office had urged the Justice Department to approve line of duty benefits in Liebengood's case. A Pelosi spokesman said the issues raised by Officer Liebengood's widow were \"well-founded.\" If they did not, she said, Congress would look for ways to change the law. In addition to Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith died by suicide in the days after the insurrection. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick also lost his life one day after responding to the insurrection. Officials say as many as 140 officers sustained injuries on January 6."

  "text": "House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0announced on Thursday that she will relinquish her leadership post after leading House Democrats for two decades, building a legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics. Pelosi\u2019s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising Democrats that she would leave her leadership post by 2022. House Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won\u2019t vote until Nov. 30. After her speech Thursday, Pelosi wouldn\u2019t tell reporters who she would support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi.  Hoyer said Jeffries \u201cwill make history for the institution of the House and for our country.\u201d Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership. Before Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader. \u201cIf she steps aside, I\u2019m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,\u201d said Beatty. \"I don\u2019t always speak for everybody, but I\u2019m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.\u201d Retiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries \u201cis prepared for the moment\u201d if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run. Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that members of her caucus\u00a0had asked her to \u201cconsider\u201d running\u00a0in the party\u2019s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: \u201cBut, again, let\u2019s just get through the election.\u201d Any decision to run again, the longtime Democratic leader had said, \u201cis about family, and also my colleagues. And what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.\u201d \u201cNonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we\u2019ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.\u201d In a sign of the challenges House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy still faces to get 218 votes to become speaker, two members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus told CNN that he doesn't have the support to become speaker. \"I think it\u2019s very clear Kevin McCarthy does not have close to 218 votes,\" said Rep. Bob Good, saying he doesn't know what concessions McCarthy has made.\u00a0 Rep. Andy Biggs, who lost to McCarthy this week when the GOP conference nominated him to be the next speaker, predicted \"some kind of consensus candidate\" will emerge after a period of negotiating. Asked about the chances McCarthy will become speaker, Biggs said flatly: \"He doesn\u2019t have the votes.\"\u00a0 The vote will be in January. Asked by CNN when he'll formally announce he's running for Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said now is the moment to celebrate Nancy Pelosi's legacy as speaker. \"Let's spend the day at this moment continuing to process the historic nature of Speaker Pelosi and the opportunity that we've all had to serve with her. And it's been an amazing experience,\" Jeffries said. \"This is a moment right now to continue to celebrate Speaker Pelosi,\" he added. More background: Jeffries has always been seen as the favorite to be the Democratic leader. Now that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has announced he will not seek an elected leadership position in the next Congress, it all but guarantees he will be leader of the caucus because he will likely run unopposed.\u00a0 Jeffries has been pitching himself to members with Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar as the No. 1, 2 and 3 for the caucus in leadership.\u00a0 Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, said Thursday she will \u201chave an announcement soon\u201d when asked if she is planning to run for any of the top Democratic leadership jobs. Jayapal told CNN that she wants to ensure \u201cprogressives are given their seat at the table\u201d as Democrats craft their new leadership slate.  She added that progressives delivered in the 2022 midterms and with the agenda of the current Congress. She wants to make sure \u201cthat is appreciated and front and center,\" the lawmaker said. It is unclear which position Jayapal would run for, but Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar are all considered the favorites for the party\u2019s top three jobs.\u00a0\u00a0 Jayapal said the plan, to her knowledge, is to let today be focused on outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then Democrats could start announcing leadership candidacies as early as tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0 Jayapal praised Pelosi for \u201cpaving the way for a lot of people\u201d and noted that she was always \u201cproud of being a progressive.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to not run for leadership marks \"a sea change in American politics, and it will have profound ramifications.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat we just witnessed was undoubtedly one of the most historically significant moments in American history,\u201d the progressive New York Democrat said.\u00a0 The relationship between Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi has at times been strained and even confrontational, but she sung Pelosi's praises in the wake of the announcement.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking about Pelosi\u2019s career, Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0said to \u201cwitness a transition of a 40-year member of Congress who ascended to the speaker, served as the first woman to be third in line to the presidency \u2014 this is a sea change in American politics, and it will have profound ramifications. And her leadership has had profound ramifications for the United States of America.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez declined to weigh in on who she would like to see replace Pelosi and her leadership team.\u00a0 \u201cI think in the direct aftermath of such a profound moment, it's a bit of whiplash right now to try to dive into the weeds of that but I do think that this you know, her broader point of have a deeper generational shift is a well taken one,\u201d she said. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn issued a statement paving the way for a new trio to lead House Democrats following Nancy Pelosi's decision to step down as speaker. \u00a0 \u201cSpeaker Pelosi has left an indelible mark on Congress and the country, and I look forward to her continued service and doing whatever I can to assist our new generation of Democratic Leaders which I hope to be Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, and Pete Aguilar,\u201d Clyburn said in a statement. The trio was spotted sitting next to Clyburn and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer during Pelosi's announcement. And Jeffries\u00a0has been pitching himself to members with Clark and Aguilar as the No. 1, 2 and 3 for the caucus in leadership.\u00a0 In a recent statement about Pelosi's decision to step down as speaker, Clark did not mention her own leadership aspirations.  Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, has always been seen as the favorite to serve as Democratic leader should House Speaker Nancy Pelosi step away from leadership. Now that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced he is not running for House leadership, it all but guarantees Jeffries will be leader of the caucus, because he will likely run unopposed. Jeffries is the current chair of the House Democratic Caucus and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said Wednesday that he won't seek a leadership position and Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, has also said he wouldn\u2019t run for party leader. \"I'm not going to get involved in making my choice in this public way. But I have said to both of (Hoyer and Jeffries) that I will not pursue the position of Leader of our party,\" Clyburn said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Wednesday. Jeffries has been pitching himself to members, with Reps. Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar as the No. 1, 2 and 3 for the caucus in leadership.\u00a0 Coming off the House floor, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldn\u2019t say who\u2019d she support as Democratic leader to succeed her. She indicated that now is not the time to make that decision. Asked how she had prepared two versions of her speech and when she made a final decision, Pelosi said: \"I didn't come here with two versions,\" suggesting she made her decision before coming in to the Capitol today.\u00a0 Also of note, as Pelosi entered her office you could hear over one minute of loud cheering and clapping, presumably from her staff and others who were there.\u00a0  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as\u00a0the first and so far only woman\u00a0to be speaker of the US House of Representatives. She was\u00a0first elected speaker in 2007\u00a0and served in the role until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the House. In 2019, she was\u00a0again elected speaker\u00a0after Democrats won back the House from Republicans. A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi\u2019s bid to become the next speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but she ultimately secured the votes needed to reclaim the title. Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities and\u00a0negotiated an agreement\u00a0with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party\u2019s top three leaders. The\u00a02018 deal\u00a0was an informal agreement, however, and caucus rules were never changed imposing any time limits on her tenure. Pelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California\u2019s 5th Congressional District. Over the years, she has earned a reputation as a powerful and formidable leader of House Democrats who has exerted significant influence and a tight grip over members of her caucus. She has also been a fierce adversary to Republicans in Congress and in the White House, and Republicans have made her a high-profile target of criticism by their party. When she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States. \u201cThis is an historic moment,\u201d she\u00a0said in a speech\u00a0after accepting the speaker\u2019s gavel. \u201cIt\u2019s an historic moment for the Congress. It\u2019s an historic moment for the women of America.\u201d Read more about Pelosi and her political career here.  House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer will not run for elected leadership in the next Congress, following Nancy Pelosi's announcement that she will step away from the speakership. In a letter sent to all Democratic members Thursday, Hoyer wrote, \"I believe that it is time for me, however, to continue my service in a different role.\u00a0Therefore, I have decided not to seek elected leadership in the 118th Congress.\" He says he will continue to do his work on the Appropriations Committee, \"including my focus on education, health care, and investing in America\u2019s productive manufacturing capacity to create more jobs and opportunities for our people.\" Hoyer has served with Pelosi for decades \u2014 spending 36 years in a Democratic leadership position. \"I have been honored to serve alongside Nancy Pelosi, whose tenure as Speaker was both historic and extraordinarily productive,\" Hoyer said in the letter. Hoyer referenced Pelosi's floor remarks when further explaining his decision, telling reporters he believes there are \"excellent alternatives.\" \u201cYou know when Nancy said there is a time and a season? I think it\u2019s a time and a season. And I think we have excellent alternatives,\" he said.\u00a0 CNN's Morgan Rimmer contributed to this reporting President Biden spoke with Nancy Pelosi Thursday morning and congratulated her on \"her historic tenure as Speaker of the House,\" according to the White House.\u00a0 Biden said in a statement following her announcement stepping down from the speakership that \"history will note she was the most consequential Speaker of the House of Representatives in our history.\"  \"In everything she does,\" Biden wrote, \"she reflects a dignity in her actions and a dignity she sees in the lives of the people of this nation.\" \"Because of Nancy Pelosi, the lives of millions and millions of Americans are better, even in districts represented by Republicans who voted against her bills and too often vilify her,\" the president continued. \"That\u2019s Nancy \u2013 always working for the dignity of all of the people.\"  Biden, in his statement, also recalled Pelosi's work throughout her time with the gavel and remarked that \"history will also note her fierceness and resolve to protect our democracy from the violent, deadly insurrection of January 6th.\"  \"She might be stepping down from her leadership role in the House Democratic Caucus, but she will never waiver in protecting our sacred democracy,\" he added, saying the nation owes her \"a deep debt of gratitude for her service, her patriotism, and above all, her absolute dignity.\" By declining to run for a leadership position but remaining in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can still fill a variety of roles in the Democratic Party, CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona explains. \"She's going to be an adviser,\" Zanona said on \"Inside Politics\" shortly after Pelosi's speech Thursday. \"Obviously we know Nancy Pelosi is a master tactician. And that's going to be hugely important for Democrats\" given the Republicans' slim majority in the lower chamber.  \"They can have a lot of power. They can make Kevin McCarthy's life pretty miserable if they stick together,\" Zanona continued. \"We expect that Nancy Pelosi will still be advising, you know, informally.\" Asked for his reaction after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would not seek a run for leadership again, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he pleaded with her to change her mind.\u00a0\u00a0 \"When she called me... I said please change your mind. We need you here,\" Schumer said, as he left the House chamber.\u00a0 Lawmakers are celebrating House Speaker's Nancy Pelosi's historic legacy after she announced that she will not run for a leadership post.  View some of the reactions below:  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Former President Barack Obama Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen  New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand  House Minority Whip Steve Scalise was among a small group of Republicans who were on the House floor for Nancy Pelosi's speech announcing she would step down as speaker.  Scalise stood with Republicans in the room, which included about two dozen lawmakers \u2014 including 10 incoming freshmen, to clap for Pelosi.  After her speech, the majority of Republicans filed out of the room, including the incoming members.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi thanked her husband, Paul, for being a \"pillar of support\" and said she was grateful for all the well-wishes that they have received for his continued recovery following a brutal attack.  \"For my dear husband Paul, who\u00a0has been my beloved partner in\u00a0life and my pillar of support,\u00a0thank you.\u00a0We're all grateful for all the\u00a0prayers and well-wishes as he\u00a0continues his recovery.\u00a0Thank you so much,\" Pelosi said as her colleagues on the House floor stood and applauded. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would relinquish her leadership post on Thursday, after leading House Democrats for two decades, building a legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics. Pelosi, the first and only woman to serve as Speaker, said that she would continue to serve in the House, giving the next generation the opportunity to lead the House Democrats, who will be in the minority next year despite a better-than-expected midterm election performance. \u201cI will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,\u201d said Pelosi in the House chamber on Thursday. \u201cFor me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect, and I\u2019m grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.\u201d Pelosi touted the party's legislative achievements under her leadership before saying: \"Now we must move boldly into the future.\" Pelosi said she will continue \"speaking for the people of San Francisco\" as their congresswoman. Her announcement comes after Democrats lost a majority in the lower chamber but maintained control of the Senate in the 2022 midterms, holding off a potentially larger \u201cred wave.\u201d Pelosi said that when she first visited the US Capitol as a child, she never imagined she would go \"from a home maker to House speaker.\" Read more about Pelosi's announcement here.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is speaking on the House floor, where she recalled first setting eyes on the Capitol building at six years old and discussed the fragility of American democracy.  Pelosi said she first saw the Capitol when she was a little girl traveling to see her father being sworn in for his fifth term in Congress.  \"Finally, I saw it: a stunning white building with a magnificent dome I believed then as I believe today \u2014 this is the most beautiful building in the world because of what it represents,\" Pelosi told lawmakers on the floor.  She called the building \"a temple of our democracy, our Constitution, our highest ideals.\"  \"All of us who have served in this House have taken the hallowed oath of office and it is the oath that stitches us together in a long and storied heritage (of) colleagues who have served before us,\" she continued, highlighting how lawmakers in the room throughout history abolished slavery, granted the women the right to vote and established hallmark social programs. \"My colleagues, I stand before you as Speaker of the House, as a wife, as a mother, a grandmother, a devout Catholic, a proud Democrat, and a patriotic American, a citizen of the greatest republic in the history of the world,\" Pelosi remarked.  The House Speaker called American democracy \"majestic\" but \"fragile.\"  \"Many of us here have witnessed its fragility firsthand, tragically, in this chamber,\" she continued.  The Democratic side of the chamber is completely full inside the House. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is sitting next to Pete Aguilar. Next to them is Reps. Hakeem Jeffries and Katherine Clark as well as Reps. Jim Clyburn and Steny Hoyer. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney is here as well.\u00a0\u00a0 On the Republican side, Reps. Rodney Davis, Ashley Hinson, G.T. Thompson, Young Kim and former Rep. Joe Walsh, were there, but they spoke during one-minutes before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is speaking now on the House floor.  Spokesperson Drew Hammill said in a tweet Wednesday that the Democratic leader would \"address her future plans\" to colleagues on Thursday.   Speculation has intensified in recent weeks that she may step down from her leadership role. There are two versions of her planned floor speech that she took home Wednesday night, a source told CNN, and it\u2019s unclear which version she will deliver. Hammill tweeted Thursday morning that the speaker would\u00a0give remarks at around 12:10 p.m. ET in the chamber. CNN's\u00a0Clare Foran and Annie Grayer contributed reporting to this post.  As Democrats wait on pins and needles for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to reveal a decision about her future, a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus told CNN that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries \u201cis prepared for the moment\u201d if Pelosi steps aside. Asked if he thinks Jeffries will run for the top Democratic leader post should Pelosi relinquish her power, retiring Rep. G.K. Butterfield said: \u201cYes.\u201d Butterfield won\u2019t get a vote because he is leaving, but he predicted the CBC will be \u201c100%\" behind Jeffries, no matter who else may run. \u00a0\u201cYou can count on that,\u201d he added. Two of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's daughters \u2014 documentarian filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi and Nancy Corrine Pelosi \u2014 are with her at the Capitol ahead of her expected speech.\u00a0 CNN reported earlier today that Pelosi didn't answer any questions when she arrived in the building.  Pelosi's spokesperson said she will \u201caddress her future plans\u201d on Thursday. There are two versions of her planned floor speech that she took home Wednesday night, a source told CNN, and it\u2019s unclear which version she will deliver. The House is set to meet at noon ET today.  As they were leaving a Democratic whip meeting, House Democrats were divided about whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi should stay in her position. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it\u2019s time for a new chapter. \u201cWell look, I think she's a historic speaker, she's a historic speaker who's accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,\u201d he said. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Rep. Hakeem Jeffries as the next leader if Pelosi steps aside. \u201cI think that if she steps aside, I'm very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for. \u2026 Well, I don't always speak for everybody, but I'm very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries,\u201d she said. While Jeffries is widely seen as a frontrunner, he declined to talk about his plans. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN that he wants Pelosi to stay on as leader, but said the caucus will stay united even if she leaves. He did not say who he\u2019d endorse.\u00a0 Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York also told CNN about the historic nature of Pelosi\u2019s time as speaker.\u00a0 Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the state Rep. Jerry Nadler represents.  House Majority Leader Steny\u00a0Hoyer\u00a0and Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries both declined to answer questions Thursday morning about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has arrived at the Capitol and is expected to address her future plans later in the day.  Hoyer\u00a0said he's waiting to hear from Pelosi, but suggested he's spoken to her.\u00a0 \"I'm not going to make any comments until the speaker does whatever she's going to do,\" he said.\u00a0 When asked if he's spoken to her since last night, he said: \"I almost always do, yes.\" When Jeffries was asked by CNN if he\u2019s spoken to Pelosi, he did not answer directly, saying \"I'm looking forward to what the speaker has to say, either in the whip meeting or later on this afternoon,\" he said.\u00a0 He also dodged a question from another reporter about whether he plans to announce a bid for leader today.\u00a0 Following this morning's whip meeting, House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn praised Pelosi saying he has \"absolutely no idea\" what her plans for the future will be. \"She has done absolutely great, fantastic. History making in more ways than one,\" he said of Pelosi. Hoyer told reporters \u201cthe Speaker\u2019s going to make her decision.\" On if it\u2019s fair to hold her members in suspense Hoyer said \u201cshe\u2019s gonna be fair. This is not a fairness issue this is a \u2014\u00a0she has to make a decision.\" House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0will \u201caddress her future plans\u201d on Thursday, her spokesperson said, at a time when the longtime Democratic leader is at a personal and professional crossroads. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi has been overwhelmed by calls from colleagues, friends and supporters. This evening, the Speaker monitored returns in the three remaining critical states. The Speaker plans to address her future plans tomorrow to her colleagues. Stay tuned,\u201d spokesperson Drew Hammill\u00a0tweeted. There are two versions of her planned floor speech that she took home Wednesday night, a source told CNN, and it\u2019s unclear which version she will deliver. Speculation over the California Democrat\u2019s future has intensified in the aftermath of the midterm elections, with some in Washington \u2013 including members of her own party \u2013 anticipating she may step aside for a new generation of leadership to take the reins after the Democrats lost the House of Representatives.\u00a0CNN projected\u00a0Wednesday that Republicans will take control of the chamber in January, though with a\u00a0smaller margin than they\u2019d hoped. Pelosi said in a separate statement Wednesday that House Democrats had \u201cdefied expectations\u201d in the midterms, but didn\u2019t mention her future plans. \u201cThis year, House Democrats defied expectations with an excellent performance: running their races with courage, optimism and determination. In the next Congress, House Democrats will continue to play a leading role in supporting President Biden\u2019s agenda \u2013 with strong leverage over a scant Republican majority,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHouse Democrats are thrilled to have so many terrific new and returning Members to the House, who will reinvigorate our Caucus with their energy, diversity and patriotism. We salute our departing Members for their magnificent leadership, achieving landmark progress on health care, climate action, infrastructure, gun violence, veterans and more that can never be diminished.\" Keep reading here. President Joe Biden has previously expressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi his hope that she remains in Congress and in a Democratic leadership post, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Pelosi will \"address her future plans\" on Thursday, her spokesperson said, at a time when the longtime Democratic leader is at a personal and professional crossroads. Politico first reported\u00a0Biden\u2019s sentiments delivered to Pelosi. Winning the House majority, even with a smaller margin than they\u2019d hoped, will give Republicans some newfound power to set the agenda when they\u00a0take over the chamber\u00a0in January. House Republicans will have subpoena power in the majority and control over powerful committees \u2014 and they plan to make investigations into the Biden administration a top priority.  On the legislative front, there will be some must-pass policy issues \u2014 like funding the government \u2014 that will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to work together. Here's a look at some of their plans:  Investigations: House Republicans are\u00a0eyeing potential probes\u00a0into everything from the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan, border policies being overseen by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, business dealings involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and the bureaucratic decision-making behind Covid-related school closures and vaccine mandates. House Republicans may also use their majority to push a counter-narrative around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack in an attempt to shift blame away from former President Donald Trump after a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol. Even before the party clinched the House majority, some of the investigative groundwork laid out by Republican officials had\u00a0started to come to fruition. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday, for instance, ordered an FBI cybersecurity official to be deposed in a lawsuit alleging that the FBI coerced social media companies to block stories about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop ahead of the 2020 election. The FBI deposition is one of several sought by the state Republican officials in a lawsuit accusing Biden officials of effectively enforcing government censorship by pushing social media companies to, among other things, police speech about the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, the efficacy of face masks and health care measures intended to curb the spread of the virus, as well as claims about election integrity and the security of voting by mail. It\u2019s not yet clear how far House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is willing to go when it comes to January 6 and the 2020 presidential election. And some Republicans argue that the party would be better served by moving past 2020. GOP legislative agenda amid narrow majority: The president can exercise veto power over legislation, but House Republicans will still be able to push some messaging bills that highlight their agenda. In an\u00a0exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security \u2014 three issues that have become central to Republicans\u2019 closing pitch to voters. McCarthy also left the door open to launching eventual impeachment proceedings, which some of his members have already begun to call for. During a private intraparty meeting on Monday ahead of leadership elections, McCarthy promised he would strip power from Democrats, vowing to kick Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and California Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff off the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source in the room. But Republicans\u2019 slim majority will stand in the way of most \u2013 if not all \u2014 of their priorities in the chamber. McCarthy\u2019s allies have recently attempted to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas to switch parties in hopes of padding their slim margins, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. Cuellar flatly rejected the idea."

  "text": "House Speaker Nancy\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0will address her future plans on Thursday, a top aide said Wednesday, hours after it became clear that Republicans will hold the majority in the lower chamber. \"The Speaker plans to address her future plans tomorrow to her colleagues. Stay tuned,\" said deputy chief of staff and spokesperson\u00a0Drew Hamill on Twitter, also adding that Pelosi has \"been overwhelmed by calls from colleagues, friends and supporters.\" CNN projected earlier this evening that Republicans will win the House after reaching the 218 seats necessary to claim a majority.  Separately, Pelosi issued a statement Wednesday saying that House Democrats \u201cdefied expectations\u201d in the midterms but didn't mention her future plans.  Read Pelosi's full statement:  \u201cThis year, House Democrats\u00a0defied expectations with an excellent performance: running\u00a0their races with courage, optimism and determination.\u00a0In\u00a0the next Congress, House Democrats will continue to play a leading role in supporting President Biden\u2019s agenda \u2014 with strong leverage over a scant Republican majority.\n\u201cHouse Democrats\u00a0are thrilled to have so many terrific new and returning Members to the House, who will reinvigorate our Caucus with their energy, diversity and patriotism.\u00a0We\u00a0salute our departing Members for their magnificent leadership, achieving landmark progress on health care, climate action, infrastructure,\u00a0gun violence, veterans and more that can never be diminished.\n\u201cAt least three critical states are still counting ballots.\u00a0We are endlessly grateful to those who continue their patriotic work to ensure each vote is counted as cast.\u201d Former Vice President Mike Pence answered questions at a CNN town hall Wednesday \u2014\u00a0including some about his own 2024 plans and his thoughts on the direction of the Republican Party after a disappointing showing in last week\u2019s midterm elections. The event took place a day after\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0announced his third bid for president and just hours after CNN projected Republicans will win the House. The event also follows the release of\u00a0Pence\u2019s memoir, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d on Tuesday. The former vice president took questions from CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and a live studio audience. Here are some of the key lines:  On Trump\u2019s candidacy: Pence said Republicans will \u201chave better choices\u201d in the 2024 presidential race than Trump, but said he believes Americans want to get back to the policies of their administration.\u00a0He did not say whether he would or wouldn't support Trump's candidacy.  On his own possible presidential bid: \u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted,\u201d Pence told Tapper when asked if his future plans involve a run for president in 2024. \"I think it\u2019s time for new leadership in this country that will bring us together around our highest ideals,\u201d he said. On the Jan. 6 insurrection: Pence called it \"the most difficult day of my public life.\" The former vice president said that on the day of the insurrection, he was determined to keep his oath \u2013 and going against Trump's wishes that day after working closely with him \"was difficult.\" After being shown footage of rioters at the Capitol chanting \u201chang Mike Pence\" during tonight's town hall, he said it saddened him to see those images, adding, \u201cthat day it angered me.\u201d On testifying before the Jan. 6 committee: Pence said that the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 \"has no right\" to his testimony, arguing that agreeing to appear before the panel would create a terrible precedent. Pence added that despite \"the partisan nature\" of the committee troubling him, he never stood in the way of his senior staff cooperating and testifying before the panel. Pence had said in August that he would\u00a0consider testifying\u00a0before the Jan. 6 committee. On election deniers in the midterm elections: The former vice president said election deniers \u201cdid not fare as well\u201d as candidates who \u201cfocused on the future.\u201d Pence added, \u201cI think both parties would do well to work to reaffirm public confidence in our elections and their integrity. But I also think that the time has come for us to produce leaders in both parties that are focused on the future.\u201d On misinformation in the 2020 election: Pence was pressed on why he didn\u2019t do more to stop Trump from spreading misinformation about the 2020 election \u2013 and make it clear to the American people that his claims of election fraud were lies. Pence blamed outside advisors like Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others for questioning the integrity of the election and essentially telling Trump what he wanted to hear. The president was surrounded by a group of advisers who were \u201ctelling him what his itching ears wanted to hear,\u201d he said. Pence said he had forged a \u201cclose working relationship with Trump\u201d calling him not only his president but his friend. He said he gave him advice in private and believed there were moments along the way where he had an impact in guiding Trump toward the right decision (without making their disagreements public). On divisiveness in politics: Pence said voters want leaders that are more respectful, saying that he thinks the country is entering a \u201cseason where\u00a0the American people are looking\u00a0for that kind of leadership that\u00a0vigorously debates our issues,\u00a0stands strongly for them, as I\u00a0always have, but does so with\u00a0gentleness and respect.\u201d Read takeaways from tonight's town hall here.  ##Pence Town Hall## Winning the House majority, even with a smaller margin than they\u2019d hoped, will give Republicans some newfound power to set the agenda when they\u00a0take over the chamber\u00a0in January. House Republicans will have subpoena power in the majority and control over powerful committees \u2014 and they plan to make investigations into the Biden administration a top priority.  On the legislative front, there will be some must-pass policy issues \u2014 like funding the government \u2014 that will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to work together. Here's a look at some of their plans:  Investigations: House Republicans are\u00a0eyeing potential probes\u00a0into everything from the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan, border policies being overseen by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, business dealings involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and the bureaucratic decision-making behind Covid-related school closures and vaccine mandates. House Republicans may also use their majority to push a counter-narrative around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack in an attempt to shift blame away from former President Donald Trump after a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol. Even before the party clinched the House majority, some of the investigative groundwork laid out by Republican officials had\u00a0started to come to fruition. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday, for instance, ordered an FBI cybersecurity official to be deposed in a lawsuit alleging that the FBI coerced social media companies to block stories about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop ahead of the 2020 election. The FBI deposition is one of several sought by the state Republican officials in a lawsuit accusing Biden officials of effectively enforcing government censorship by pushing social media companies to, among other things, police speech about the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, the efficacy of face masks and health care measures intended to curb the spread of the virus, as well as claims about election integrity and the security of voting by mail. It\u2019s not yet clear how far House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is willing to go when it comes to January 6 and the 2020 presidential election. And some Republicans argue that the party would be better served by moving past 2020. GOP legislative agenda amid narrow majority: The president can exercise veto power over legislation, but House Republicans will still be able to push some messaging bills that highlight their agenda. In an\u00a0exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security \u2014 three issues that have become central to Republicans\u2019 closing pitch to voters. McCarthy also left the door open to launching eventual impeachment proceedings, which some of his members have already begun to call for. During a private intraparty meeting on Monday ahead of leadership elections, McCarthy promised he would strip power from Democrats, vowing to kick Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and California Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff off the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source in the room. But Republicans\u2019 slim majority will stand in the way of most \u2013 if not all \u2014 of their priorities in the chamber. McCarthy\u2019s allies have recently attempted to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas to switch parties in hopes of padding their slim margins, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. Cuellar flatly rejected the idea. Following the US Supreme Court's ruling in June to get rid of the federal constitutional right to an abortion in June, former Vice President Mike Pence is now calling for states to enact further restrictions. Speaking during a CNN town hall Wednesday night, he welcomed that the issue of abortion \"has been returned to the states and the American people, where it belongs.\"  The court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade gave individual states the power to regulate abortion. And some states have chosen to protect it explicitly in their state constitutions while others have enacted laws that restricted, or outright banned, the procedure. Pence said states should be enacting \"pro-life protections\" as well as \"demonstrate generosity and compassion\" to women facing what he described as \"crisis pregnancies.\" He also said more resources should be allocated to help support newborns. \"I always believed that Roe v.\u00a0Wade would be overturned.\u00a0I just didn't know if it would\u00a0be overturned in my lifetime,\" Pence said. \"I'll look forward to being a\u00a0part of that \u2014 bringing principle\u00a0and compassion to that debate. But because of the Supreme\u00a0Court's decision, the debate is\u00a0now returned to the American\u00a0people.\u00a0And I'll be a part of that in\u00a0the cause of life,\" he added. ##Pence Town Hall## Former Vice President Mike Pence was pressed by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on why he didn\u2019t do more to stop former President Donald Trump from spreading misinformation about the 2020 election \u2013 and make it clear to the American people that his claims of election fraud were lies. Pence, speaking at CNN's town hall Wednesday night, blamed outside advisors like Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others for questioning the integrity of the election and essentially telling Trump what he wanted to hear. The President was surrounded by a group of advisers who were \u201ctelling him what his itching ears wanted to hear,\u201d he said. But Tapper pointed out that Pence wrote in his book that the election was essentially over on Dec. 14, 2020, when the electoral college voted, yet Trump continued to push state lawmakers to try to overturn the election results. Tapper pointed out that Pence didn\u2019t say anything publicly \u2013 making it clear that he disagreed with those efforts \u2013 until his public statement on Jan. 6. Pence said he had forged a \u201cclose working relationship with Trump\u201d calling him not only his president but his friend. He said he gave him advice in private and believed there were moments along the way where he had an impact in guiding Trump toward the right decision (without making their disagreements public). \"I continued to hope that he would come around,\" Pence said. \"Things actually didn't come to a head and become truly contentious between us until the final days, and the final hours.\" But in the end, Pence said, Trump did not come around. ##Pence Town Hall## Former Vice President Mike Pence said that the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 \"has no right\" to his testimony, arguing that agreeing to appear before the panel would create a terrible precedent. \"Congress doesn't report to the White House. The White House doesn't report\u00a0to the Congress.\u00a0And I truly do believe in\u00a0defense of the separation of powers and to avoid what would\u00a0be a terrible precedent -- the\u00a0very notion of a committee on Congress, in Congress, summoning\u00a0a vice president to speak about deliberations that took place\u00a0at the White House, I think, would\u00a0violate that separation of\u00a0powers.\u00a0And I think it would erode the\u00a0dynamic of the office of\u00a0president and vice president for\u00a0many years to come,\" Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper. Pence added that despite \"the partisan nature\" of the committee troubling him, he never stood in the way of his senior staff cooperating and testifying before the panel.  Pence had said in August that he would consider testifying before the Jan. 6 committee. Watch the moment: ##Pence Town Hall## Former Vice President Mike Pence said in CNN\u2019s town hall that focusing on complaints about the 2020 election is a political loser for Republicans.\u00a0 Pence said he had hoped the GOP would win Senate control and win a larger majority in the House in last week\u2019s midterm elections.\u00a0 The common denominator, Pence said, was that candidates focused on the future did very well while those focused on \"relitigating the past\" did not fare as well.  \"And I expect that\u2019s going to be taken to heart by Republicans,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He deflected some blame, saying that he campaigned with some election deniers \u2013including New Hampshire Senate nominee Don Bolduc and Arizona Senate nominee Blake Masters \u2013 because he wanted to see Republican majorities on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 He also equated Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud in 2020 to Hillary Clinton in 2016.\u00a0 \u201cI think there\u2019s been far too much questioning of elections, not just in 2020 but in 2016, where Hillary Clinton said that the election was stolen, said that Donald Trump was not a legitimate president, for years,\u201d Pence said.  \u201cI think both parties would do well to work to reaffirm public confidence in our elections and their integrity. But I also think that the time has come for us to produce leaders in both parties that are focused on the future,\u201d he added. Watch the moment: ##Pence Town Hall## Former Vice President Mike Pence said he was angry with former President Donald Trump in the days following the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol. \"I must tell you the\u00a0president's words and tweet that\u00a0day were reckless.\u00a0They endangered my family and\u00a0all the people at the Capitol,\" Pence said during a CNN town hall Wednesday after watching video of secret service trying to get him and his wife out of the building during the riot. Pence said he was \"angry,\" but in the days that followed, he leaned on his faith, specifically pointing to the moment when he met with the former president. \"I prayed for\u00a0God's grace to meet that moment\u00a0and that spirit \u2014\u00a0and it wasn't easy,\" he said. \"To be honest with you I'm\u00a0as human as the next guy and I still pray for the\u00a0president, and I pray for the\u00a0grace to forgive him and all\u00a0those responsible for that\u00a0tragic day.\" \"But I truly do believe that we\u00a0live in a time when the American\u00a0people ought to be searching\u00a0their hearts and having more\u00a0grace toward one another,\" Pence added. The former vice president said he believes Trump was \"remorseful\" and \"saddened\" about what happened, saying, \"I know that's at odds with people's public perception about him, but I want to tell you it was true.\" Watch the moment: ##Pence Town Hall## During tonight's CNN town hall, Jake Tapper played footage of rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 chanting \u201chang Mike Pence,\" and asked former Vice President Mike Pence to reflect on what he felt in those moments. Pence first said it saddened him to see those images, adding \u201cthat day it angered me.\u201d He noted that he told Secret Service that he would not leave the Capitol and was determined to stay at his post, in part because he did not want to give those rioters the sight of his motorcade speeding away that day. \u201cBut frankly, when I saw those images, and when I read a tweet that President Trump issued, saying that I lacked courage in that moment. It angered me greatly,\u201d Pence told Tapper. But, he said, \u201cI didn't have time for it.\u201d \u201cThe President had decided in that moment to be a part of the problem,\u201d Pence said. He added he \u201cwas determined to be part of the solution. And so we essentially set that aside.\u201d He said he gathered the Republican and Democratic leadership of the House and Senate on a conference call, reached out to leadership at the Pentagon and the Justice Department \u201cto surge additional resources\u201d to assist Capitol Hill police officers. Ultimately, he noted they were able to reconvene Congress on the same day. \u201cWe demonstrated to the American people and the world the strength of our institutions, the resilience of our democracy, but those memories, those images will always be with me,\u201d Pence said.  Watch the moment: He\u2019s published a memoir, gone out on the media circuit for interviews and is standing now at a CNN town hall \u2013 so what are Pence\u2019s plans and do they involve a run for president in 2024? Faced with that question on Wednesday night, Pence was coy. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted,\u201d Pence told Jake Tapper. Moments earlier, as he avoided committing his support to former President Donald Trump\u2019s newly announced campaign, Pence said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time for new leadership in this country that will bring us together around our highest ideals.\u201d Pressed on the question about his own future, Pence replied, \u201cThere may be someone else in that contest I\u2019d prefer more.\u201d \u201cI honestly believe we\u2019re going to have better choices,\u201d Pence said. Former Vice President Mike Pence said that Jan. 6, 2021, was \"the most difficult day of my public life,\" during tonight's CNN town hall.  \"Clearly the days leading up to Jan. 6 and Jan. 6 itself was the most difficult day of my public life,\" Pence responded to a question from an audience member, Daniela Moloci, a student from Indiana University. Pence went on to discuss how he was \"always loyal\" to former President Donald Trump and kept any disagreements he had with him private.  \"I thought it was important, as\u00a0vice president, that I offer my\u00a0advice and my counsel to the\u00a0president confidentially.\u00a0And we did.\u00a0But I had one higher loyalty,\u00a0and that was to God and the\u00a0Constitution.\u00a0And that's what set in motion\u00a0the confrontation that would\u00a0come to pass on Jan. 6\u00a0because I had taken an oath to\u00a0the Constitution of the United\u00a0States,\" Pence said.  He said that on the day of the insurrection he was determined to keep his oath \u2013 and going against Trump's wishes that day after working closely with him \"was difficult.\"  \"But I'll always believe that we\u00a0did our duty that day upholding\u00a0the Constitution of the United\u00a0States and the laws of this\u00a0country and the peaceful\u00a0transfer of power,\" the former vice president said.  Watch the moment: ##Pence Town Hall## Former Vice President Mike Pence said in a CNN town hall Wednesday night that Republicans will \u201chave better choices\u201d in the 2024 presidential race than former President Donald Trump. Pence told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper he believes Americans \u201cwant us to get back to the policies of the Trump-Pence administration.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe other thing that I\u2019ve heard consistently is the American people are looking for new leadership -- leadership that will unite our country around our highest ideals, leadership that will reflect the civility and respect that most Americans have for each other,\u201d Pence said.\u00a0 He did not directly address whether he will run for president himself but alluded to the possibility.\u00a0 \u201cI think in the days ahead, whatever role I and my family play in the Republican Party, whether it\u2019s as a candidate or simply a part of the cause, I think we\u2019ll have better choices than my old running mate. I think America longs to go back to the policies that were working for the American people \u2013 but I think it\u2019s time for new leadership,\u201d Pence said. Watch the moment: ##Pence Town Hall## Democrat Andrea Salinas will win in Oregon's 6th Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Mike Erickson. This is a new seat. CNN projected earlier this evening that Republicans will win the House after reaching the 218 seats necessary to claim a majority.  On the topic of political divisiveness in America, former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he thinks people want to see leadership that will unite people around our \"highest ideals.\"  At a CNN town hall, Pence said that during his early days in politics he \"got involved in one of those negative personal attacks,\" but when it was all over, he tried to get back to his faith and move forward in a way that demonstrated decency with a commitment to treating people decently. He said he believes that Americans are looking to get back to that sentiment. \"We're going into a season where\u00a0the American people are looking\u00a0for that kind of leadership that\u00a0vigorously debates our issues,\u00a0stands strongly for them, as I\u00a0always have, but does so with\u00a0gentleness and respect,\" Pence said. On the topic of Donald Trump, a candidate and president who highlighted divides in American politics, Pence said when Trump was the Republican nominee for president he \"was the right man at the right time.\" He said he believes Trump was the only candidate that could have beaten Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, pointing to the unique political landscape. But Pence added that he thinks we are \"moving into a different season in America.\" ##Pence Town Hall## Former Vice President Mike Pence is participating in a CNN town hall as questions swirl about his plans for 2024 and the direction of the Republican Party after a disappointing showing in last week\u2019s midterm elections. CNN anchor and chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper will be moderating the discussion. The town hall will be held in New York City in front of a live studio audience and Pence is expected to take questions.  The town hall is taking place the day after\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0announced his third bid for president and just hours after CNN projected Republicans will win the House. The event also follows the release of\u00a0Pence\u2019s memoir, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d on Tuesday. The former vice president has hinted at his own potential 2024 run, recently telling ABC News he thinks\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019ll have better choices in the future\u201d\u00a0than Trump. In the same interview, he criticized Trump for being\u00a0\u201creckless\u201d with his tweet attacking him on Jan. 6, 2021. Pence has been coy about his plans for 2024, but he has long been viewed as a potential aspirant for the Republican presidential nomination. How can you watch it? The town hall will stream live for paid TV subscribers via CNN.com and CNN OTT and mobile apps under \u201cTV Channels,\u201d and on CNNgo, including on top of our live updates coverage. The town hall will also be available on demand beginning Thursday to paid TV subscribers via CNN.com, CNN apps, and cable operator platforms.  ##Pence Town Hall## Democrat Rep. Mike Levin will win in California's 49th District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Brian Maryott. This is a Democratic hold.\u00a0 CNN projected earlier this evening that Republicans will win the House after reaching the 218 seats necessary to claim a majority.  House Republicans\u00a0voted for\u00a0Kevin McCarthy as their leader on Tuesday. But that victory contained a dangerous omen for the California Republican as he tries to become the next speaker of the House. McCarthy won the leadership vote over Arizona GOP Rep. Andy Biggs by a 188-31 margin. Which is the problem. CNN projects that Republicans will win\u00a0control of the House\u00a0\u2014 but their majority will be a narrow one. As of Wednesday evening,\u00a0CNN projected\u00a0Republicans will control 218 seats compared to 208 for the Democrats.\u00a0If the current leaders of the nine uncalled races wind up winning, that would leave Republicans with 221 seats. Under that scenario, McCarthy would only be able to afford to lose three Republican votes in the new Congress to secure a majority and become speaker, presuming Democrats remain united in opposition. That would mean McCarthy could only lose one out of every 10 members who cast a ballot for Biggs. Which is almost zero margin for error. It\u2019s worth noting here that voting against McCarthy in a secret-ballot election among the Republican conference isn\u2019t the same thing as voting against him to be speaker on the House floor in January. It\u2019s possible that the members who voted against him \u2014 particularly the members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus \u2014 did so as a way of voicing their concerns and getting McCarthy\u2019s attention. McCarthy can also take some solace in fact that past House speakers initially received fewer than 218 votes\u00a0in their intraparty elections. Democrats nominated Nancy Pelosi for speaker by a 203-32 vote in 2018, and Republicans nominated Paul Ryan by a 200-43 vote in 2015 \u2013 though both enjoyed larger majorities at the time than McCarthy will. Democratic Rep. Karen Bass overcame more than $100 million in spending by her rival Rick Caruso to win the Los Angeles mayor\u2019s race, CNN projects, making history as the first woman and the first Black woman to serve as mayor. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, was on Joe Biden\u2019s shortlist for a running mate in the 2020 campaign.  She\u2019s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature. In her campaign, Bass emphasized the depth of her policy experience and her reputation as a collaborative listener and legislator. She also highlighted her early work as a physician assistant in the emergency room and her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South LA in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic. She did that work through the nonprofit she founded, Community Coalition.\u00a0 Bass also highlighted her role as a dealmaker when she led the California State Assembly after the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 making budget decisions that earned her a John F. Kennedy\u00a0Profile in Courage Award\u00a0in 2010.\u00a0She also made history in that role \u2013 becoming the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature in 2008.\u00a0 She argued that her experience would give her a unique perspective and understanding of the problems with homelessness in Los Angeles. She said her experience in the emergency room had given her a depth of understanding of the problem that her primary rivals, including Caruso, did not have.\u00a0 \u201cI have a background in the medical field. I\u2019ve worked with these patients,\u201d she told CNN in an interview earlier this year. \u201cI spent several years in the emergency room at (LA) county. My patients were homeless. My patients were mentally ill. They had substance abuse. I know these systems.\u201d\u00a0 She said she would declare a state of emergency on homelessness that would set a new tone on addressing homelessness citywide: \u201cIt should be dealt with like a natural disaster,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping that we begin to build a new spirit in this city, where people understand that this problem is everyone\u2019s problem.\u201d President Joe Biden congratulated House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Republicans winning the House majority and said he is \u201cready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families.\u201d \u201cLast week\u2019s elections demonstrated the strength and resilience of American democracy,\u201d a statement from the president said. \u201cThere was a strong rejection of election deniers, political violence, and intimidation. There was an emphatic statement that, in America, the will of the people prevails.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cIn this election, voters spoke clearly about their concerns: the need to lower costs, protect the right to choose, and preserve our democracy. As I said last week, the future is too promising to be trapped in political warfare. The American people want us to get things done for them. They want us to focus on the issues that matter to them and on making their lives better. And I will work with anyone \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 willing to work with me to deliver results for them.\"  Republicans will win control of the House, CNN projects, and with that majority comes the power of committees and influence to set the agenda, which will make things much harder for the Biden administration in the next two years. The GOP has won the 218 seats necessary to claim the majority, according to CNN projections, and Democrats will have a narrow majority in the Senate. CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju explained why winning control of the House is significant for Republicans.\u00a0 \"You have subpoena power.\u00a0You can set schedules for\u00a0hearings.\u00a0You can call Cabinet secretaries\u00a0to come testify. You can do what your party wants to do,\u201d Raju said as he noted how it will impact what might come from lawmakers at the start of the new year. Additionally, Kevin McCarthy, who won his party\u2019s nomination for speaker of the House, and the rest of GOP leadership will be able to set the exact schedule for what they want to bring to the floor. They can also refuse to bring measures up and set priorities that align with their party\u2019s agenda, Raju added. In the first two years of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, Democrats held a narrow majority in both the House and Senate. This allowed them to pass some significant bills strictly along party lines, like the Inflation Reduction Act, for example, Raju explained.  \u201cThey will no longer be able to\u00a0do that, because in order to\u00a0move through the budget process,\u00a0you need support within\u2026\u00a0essentially among your party, and\u00a0Republicans and Democrats would\u00a0not agree to move in such\u00a0sweeping legislation like that,\u201d Raju said in his analysis, adding that any legislation that passes now will have to be incremental. WATCH: Manu Raju  explains what the GOP taking control of the House means  Republicans will win control of the House of Representatives, CNN projects, reaching the threshold of 218 seats needed for a majority in the chamber after Republican Mike Garcia won in California's 27th Congressional District.  The victory will fall short of their hopes of a \u201cred wave\u201d but thwart President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic agenda and will likely subject his White House to relentless investigations. The fact that the GOP finally passed the threshold of 218 seats needed for control of the chamber eight days after Election Day \u2013 and that it came down to the final districts to report results \u2013 underscores the party\u2019s underwhelming midterm election performance, which history and political logic suggested should have delivered a heftier rebuke to Biden and Democrats. In defiance of political gravity, Democrats held onto the Senate after an election dominated by concerns about high inflation and influenced, in some places, by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of a constitutional right to abortion this summer. There\u2019s still an outstanding Senate race in Georgia, which will be decided by a December runoff and will determine how large the Democrats\u2019 majority will be. Republicans\u2019 victory in the House will end Democrat Nancy Pelosi\u2019s second tenure as speaker in January. But its majority looks set to number a handful of seats, far short of initial expectations in a margin that will make managing a restive Republican conference a stiff task for party leaders. And while less impressive than party leaders had hoped for, it still represents a return of Trump-style ideology and chaos politics to Washington, given the strong influence the ex-president is likely to wield over his acolytes in the GOP conference. The former president announced his 2024 presidential bid on Tuesday night. Republican Rep. Mike Garcia will in California's 27 District, CNN projects, helping the GOP reach the 218 seats necessary to gain control of the House.  After Maine\u2019s ranked-choice tabulation, Rep. Jared Golden will win in the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Bruce Poliquin in a rematch of their 2018 contest for the same seat.\u00a0This is a Democratic hold.  Here's where things stand in the House:  House seats controlled by Republicans: 217\nHouse seats controlled by Democrats: 208\nUncalled House races: 10 Republicans need to win one more race to reach the 218 seats necessary to gain control of the House.  The\u00a0$122 million-dollar\u00a0Los Angeles mayor\u2019s race between US Rep. Karen Bass and real estate magnate Rick Caruso is still too close to call,\u00a0along with six House races\u00a0in California that could determine the balance of power in Washington, raising a perennial question: Why does it take California so long to count its votes? More than a week after\u00a0Election Day\u00a0and as the nation awaits an official call on which party will control the US House of Representatives, attention is turning to some of the outstanding races in\u00a0California\u00a0that could tip the scales. Tuesday was the last day that county election officials could accept ballots that were postmarked on or before Election Day \u2014 meaning the Golden State is just getting started counting some of those late-arriving ballots. California now mails every registered voter a ballot, a practice that began in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic and ultimately became\u00a0permanent\u00a0in Sept. 2021 in an effort to increase voter access and participation. Under state law, ballots postmarked on or before Election Day must be accepted by county elections offices for seven days after polls close. The sheer volume of ballots that election officials are now counting is enormous. In the 2020 election, more than 15 million mail ballots were cast in the general election \u2013 comprising about\u00a087% of the total. This year, there were nearly 22 million\u00a0registered California voters\u00a0by mid-October, according to figures from the California secretary of state. The official canvassing period \u2014 the process of tabulating votes \u2014 will continue up to Dec. 8, when county election officials must report their final official results to the secretary of state (though some counties have set earlier deadlines to certify their own election results). The California secretary of state will certify the state\u2019s results by Dec. 16. \u201cIt\u2019s just a huge electorate and in some of the counties \u2014 LA County, Orange County, even Kern County where the [GOP Rep. David] Valadao race is \u2013 there are a lot of people living there and a lot of ballots that have to be counted,\u201d said Christian Grose, academic director at the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, who has studied election administration. \u201cWith that \u2018week after\u2019 deadline, really the counting starts in earnest now. They really will be finishing the counting in the next week or two instead of the immediate day after Election Day.\u201d Keep reading here.  Former Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News that he is \u201cclosing the door\u201d on testifying before the House Select Committee investigating Jan. 6, putting an end to the question of whether he would agree to speak with the committee before it wraps its investigation.\u00a0 \u201cI am closing the door on that, but I must say again, the partisan nature of the Jan. 6 committee has been a disappointment to me,\u201d Pence said.\u00a0\u00a0 Pence criticized the makeup of the committee, ignoring the fact that Republicans rejected earlier opportunities to form the panel in a more bipartisan fashion, but acknowledged that he did not stand in the way of members of his senior staff, including his chief of staff Marc Short, from testifying in front of the panel.\u00a0 \u201cIt's inconceivable to me that one party would appoint every member of a committee in Congress that's antithetical to the whole idea of the committee system,\u201d Pence said.\u00a0 \u201cThat being said, I never stood in the way of senior members of my team cooperating with the committee and testifying. But Congress has no right to my testimony,\" Pence said.  He continued, \"We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States. And I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a Vice President of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.\u201d Pence said even though he does not want to testify before the committee, he would continue to share his story about what happened on Jan. 6 in his book and he will \u201ccontinue to speak openly about it.\u201d CNN has previously reported that Pence\u2019s legal counsel had been in communication with the committee about whether he would testify. Over the summer, the panel dedicated an entire hearing to the pressure campaign Pence faced in the lead-up to Capitol attack, which included testimony from some of his top aides. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the committee, was quick to criticize Pence\u2019s decision not to testify. \u201cHey Pence, do you like Democracy or nah?\u00a0Did trump break the law or nah? Pick a lane and a position.\u00a0You will fail to please everyone\u201d Kinzinger\u00a0tweeted. Pence will participate in a CNN town hall airing at 9:00 p.m. ET tonight.  Committee's response: The House select committee also issued a statement pushing back on Pence's comments.  \u201cThe Select Committee has proceeded respectfully and responsibly in our engagement with Vice President Pence, so it is disappointing that he is\u00a0misrepresenting the nature of\u00a0our investigation while giving interviews to promote his new book\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who serve as chair and vice chair of the committee respectively, said in a joint statement. \u201cThe Select Committee has consistently praised the former Vice President\u2019s refusal to bow to former President Trump\u2019s pressure to illegally refuse to count electoral votes on January 6th. But his recent statements about the Select Committee are not accurate.\u201d The panel\u2019s leaders also debunked Pence\u2019s criticism of the makeup of the committee neglected to include Republican members, detailing how Republican pushback along the way led to the committee\u2019s current formation. ##Pence Town Hall## A\u00a0growing\u00a0number of\u00a0Senate\u00a0Republicans are calling for a reassessment of\u00a0the\u00a0National Republican\u00a0Senatorial\u00a0Committee\u2019s\u00a0spending\u00a0decisions\u00a0after\u00a0the party\u00a0failed\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0back\u00a0the majority\u00a0in\u00a02022\u00a0despite a favorable\u00a0national\u00a0political\u00a0environment.\u00a0 The\u00a0NRSC and\u00a0the\u00a0Senate\u00a0Leadership Fund, the\u00a0Mitch McConnell-aligned Super PAC, have sparred for months over\u00a0the\u00a0quality of various candidates and when, where and how\u00a0to spend resources. Utah Senator Mitt Romney\u00a0said Wednesday that he has not called for an \u201caudit\u201d of\u00a0the\u00a0NRSC. But he would like\u00a0to\u00a0see an evaluation of its \u201cinitiatives,\u201d \u201cinvestments,\u201d \u201cfundraising\u201d and payments\u00a0to\u00a0political\u00a0consultants. \u201cAnytime I think we make an\u00a0investment, we should see what worked and what didn\u2019t,\u201d said Romney. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly a candidate for that kind of evaluation.\u201d \u201cHow well did various aspects of fundraising go,\u201d he asked. \u201cHow much was paid\u00a0to\u00a0various consultants and did\u00a0they\u00a0do\u00a0the\u00a0job we wanted\u00a0them\u00a0to\u00a0do?\u201d\u00a0 Asked if he was concerned about any potential wrongdoing, Romney said, \u201cNo.\u201d Republican\u00a0Sen. Rick Scott,\u00a0the\u00a0NRSC chair, said\u00a0in\u00a0a statement that\u00a0the\u00a0Senate\u00a0GOP campaign arm is \u201cmore than happy\u201d\u00a0to\u00a0discuss its\u00a0spending\u00a0with senators.\u00a0Politico\u00a0first reported that a couple of lawmakers \u2014 Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Thom Tillis \u2014 privately called for an audit of\u00a0the\u00a0NRSC on Tuesday.\u00a0 Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said\u00a0there was a \u201cdistinct change\u00a0in\u00a0tone\u201d from members at\u00a0the Senate\u00a0GOP\u2019s closed-door meeting on Wednesday. \u201cSenators\u00a0backed off of that\u00a0today,\u201d said Hawley. \u201cI don\u2019t know if\u00a0there was a little\u00a0indigestion about that... People who had yesterday were using that word,\u00a0today said, \u2018Oh, that's not what I meant. That's not what I meant.\u2019\u201d But Tillis reiterated his call on Wednesday, according\u00a0to\u00a0a person familiar. And a Blackburn spokesperson said, \u201cSenator Blackburn\u2019s position has not changed. That is\u00a0incorrect.\u201d House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said he has \u201cplenty of time\u201d to get the support of members of his conference who voted against his speakership bid on Tuesday, following an hours-long meeting where Republicans discussing the rules package that will govern the new Congress. \u201cI think we got plenty of time to do that, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know that this is about winning them over. I think it's discussing and listening to them.\u201d McCarthy said progress was made on several fronts, including expanding the Steering Committee and saying leadership would like to open up the floor for more amendments.\u00a0 \u201cWe'll continue to work with our conference to be able to produce more of their amendments for the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not done. It was a great discussion. We got part of it done. We'll carry it on again after we come back\u201d from recess, McCarthy said.  Remember: CNN has yet to project which party will win control of the House although the GOP is only one seat away from gaining the necessary 218 seats. Speaking to a group of Republican donors in Orlando on Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis touted his strength in the suburbs, his rural turnout effort and his appeal with Latino voters just one week after he cruised to victory in his reelection effort. DeSantis made the pitch in a conversational tone that reflected his good mood after his win last week, according to a person in the room. His remarks came at a time when the Florida Republican is being touted as a potential presidential candidate and a preferable alternative among many in the party to former President Donald Trump. The group of about 250 people, which included donors to the Republican Governors Association as well as governors and their spouses, gave DeSantis a standing ovation at the end of his conversation with outgoing Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts. The person in the room told CNN that DeSantis walked through in detail where he performed well across the state, including winning the traditionally Democratic Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. When asked by Ricketts what he would like to work on with Republican governors, DeSantis said he was looking to take on the growth of so-called environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investment funds as well as improving border security, the person said. A second person familiar with the speech confirmed that DeSantis did not mention Trump, who later on Tuesday announced he was running for president in 2024. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who lost a bid for the GOP leadership in the Senate in a secret ballot Wednesday, didn't answer directly when asked if he has confidence in Sen. Mitch McConnell's leadership.   \"I support the Republican leadership,\" he told CNN. McConnell won the leadership vote 37-10-1 and said at a news conference that he was \u201cpretty proud\u201d of the result. Scott also defended the decision of the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 which he chairs \u2014 to not engage in GOP primaries, a decision some McConnell allies believe helped weak candidates emerge.\u00a0 \u201cWe should trust the voters of the states,\u201d he said. Asked if he supported former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, Scott said: \u201cI\u2019m not getting involved in the presidential campaigns.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could make an announcement about whether she will run for the top House Democrat leadership spot this week, according to several senior representatives. While Pelosi hasn't said one way or the other what she will do so far, the senior House Democrats told CNN they believe she will announce her decision before the House recess by the end of the week. Why this is important: What happens in Democratic leadership elections revolves around the key question of what Pelosi decides to do. Until Pelosi makes her announcement, much of the rest of the field is expected to remain essentially frozen in place. If Pelosi decides to run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats, it will make clear that she is not yet ready to relinquish her role atop the House Democratic caucus. Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, commands widespread support among her members and is viewed as an effective leader within her party. But if she runs again for leadership, such a move would also likely surprise, and even frustrate, many in Washington, including members of her own party, who have been anticipating that she might step aside for a new generation of leadership to take the reins. If Pelosi does not run for the top leadership post, it would set the stage for a major shakeup in House Democratic leadership and mark the end of an era for Washington. The move would kick off a fight for her successor that could expose divisions within the party as other prominent members of the party look to move up the leadership ladder. Remember: CNN has not projected which party will control the House yet. Republicans are on the cusp of reaching the 218 seats necessary to claim a House majority. Eleven House races remain uncalled \u2014\u00a0and the GOP needs to win one more to gain control of the lower chamber. CNN's Clare Foran,\u00a0Melanie Zanona\u00a0and\u00a0Annie Grayer contributed to this report Rep. Adam Schiff will not seek a leadership position in the Democratic caucus next Congress, multiple sources tell CNN.  Instead, he is considering a run for Senate in California where Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, 89, is up for reelection in 2024.\u00a0\u00a0 This paves the way for Hakeem Jeffries to become the leader of the Democratic caucus. Jeffries is widely seen as the favorite in the caucus for the position, if House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who is the current leader, runs for a different position next Congress.\u00a0 Hoyer is considering a number of options to stay in Democratic leadership in the new Congress, including running for leader or for the whip position, sources told CNN on Tuesday. Remember: CNN\u00a0has yet to project\u00a0which party will win the House as several key races are too early to call. But, right now, Republicans hold 217 seats \u2014 one away from the 218 needed to capture the majority. House Democratic leadership elections have been announced for Nov. 30. Voting will take place behind closed doors via secret ballot using an app. To be elected to any position in Democratic leadership, a candidate needs to win a majority among those present and voting. If more than two candidates run and no one wins a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes after the first round of voting will be eliminated and voting will proceed to a second round.  Republicans are one seat away from winning control of the House, with votes in some western states and Maine still being counted more than a week after Election Day. Either party needs to win at least 218 seats to have the majority. Here's where the balance of power in the House stands: Republicans have won 217 seats\nDemocrats currently hold 207 seats\n11 races have not been projected The most uncalled races are in California \u2014 six of the remaining 11 races have not been projected. Counting there could take weeks because the official canvass is not due for a month after Election Day. Two races are still too close to call in Colorado, including in the 3rd District where Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert is in a surprisingly tight race, leading by just more than 1,1000 votes with about 99% of ballots in. Alaska and Maine still have one race each to call. Both states use a ranked-choice voting system. Oregon also has not yet projected the winner in its 6th Congressional District. The state conducts its elections entirely by mail. Senate leadership elections: Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0won a secret-ballot leadership election\u00a0after days of finger-pointing over the Republican election losses, putting him on pace to becoming the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history in the next Congress. McConnell defeated Sen. Rick Scott, his first challenger in his 15 years atop his conference. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that the Democratic Senate leadership elections will be\u00a0on Dec. 8, according to a source. Still ahead: Former Vice President Mike Pence is set to participate in a CNN town hall on Wednesday as questions swirl about his plans for 2024 and the direction of the Republican Party after a disappointing showing in the midterm elections. The town hall is taking place the day after\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0announced his third bid for president and follows the release of\u00a0Pence\u2019s memoir, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d on Tuesday. ##Catch Up## Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley both said after a lengthy Senate GOP meeting that they voted for Sen. Rick Scott for leader over Mitch McConnell because they wanted change in the wake of the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cI voted for change,\u201d said Graham. \u201cI accept the results of the conference, and I hope we can be better.\u201d\u00a0 Asked by CNN why McConnell won, Hawley turned sarcastic.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do I think he won? Because the conference doesn't want to change course,\u201d said Hawley. \u201cThey want to do what we're doing. It's working so well.\u201d Hawley told reporters that he asked McConnell and Scott why \u201ca sizable number of\u201d independent voters stayed home.\u00a0 \u201cThat's why there wasn't a red wave,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI just asked both of the candidates, \u2018Do you acknowledge that as a fact \u2014 and what do you think we need to do different?\u2019 Because clearly, the Republican Party's got to do something different if we ever want to be a majority party,\u201d said Hawley.\u00a0\u00a0 Hawley also told reporters that he believes McConnell blames former President Donald Trump for the party's lackluster showing in the midterms.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think Senator McConnell's\u00a0view is that Trump is largely to blame, and that Republicans have an image problem because of Trump. I have to say that I don't agree with that,\" he said.\u00a0 Hawley added to CNN that he doesn't believe this division within the conference his going away.\u00a0 \"I hope that this is the beginning of a conversation and not the end of it. And we haven't resolved anything, we've chosen leadership, which is the same leadership. So now we've got to think about what do we do going forward,\" he said. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that their caucus leadership elections will be\u00a0on Dec. 8, according to a source familiar at the Senate Democrats\u2019 lunch Wednesday. Schumer\u00a0plans to nominate Sen. Patty Murray to be president pro tempore during the elections, the source said, adding that the position will be subject to approval by the full conference. Murray is getting the job because 89-year-old Dianne Feinstein passed up the position. Her office hasn\u2019t said why but members have been concerned about her mental sharpness. CNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell wins a secret-ballot leadership election after days of finger-pointing over the Republican election losses, putting him on pace to becoming the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history in the next Congress. McConnell defeated Sen. Rick Scott, his first challenger in his 15 years atop his conference. McConnell spokesperson David Popp confirmed the outcome but did not provide a tally. McConnell won the leadership vote 37-10-1, according to two senators. One senator voted present. McConnell took a victory lap after winning reelection, saying \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d but made clear to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that he does not \u201cown this job.\u201d As former President Trump announced his intention to run for reelection in 2024 on Tuesday night, McConnell noted he plans to \u201cstay out\u201d of the GOP presidential primary as it will be \u201chighly contested\u201d and he doesn\u2019t \u201chave a dog in that fight.\u201d\u00a0 Raju asked McConnell about what he\u2019s learned from his first leadership challenge and whether he\u2019ll change his approach at all. McConnell responded that he doesn\u2019t \u201cown\u201d this job and \u201canyone who wants to run for it can feel free to do so\u201d, but he feels \u201cpretty proud\u201d of the results. \u201cFirst, I don't own this job. Anybody who wants to run for it can feel free to do so, and so I'm not in any way offended by having an opponent or having a few votes in opposition,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAs everyone has said, we had a good opportunity to discuss the various differences. People had a chance to listen to both candidates. And I'm pretty proud of 37 to 10.\u201d  McConnell made the remarks on Wednesday at a press conference after a lengthy closed-door meeting among the Republican caucus where they elected a leader by secret ballot. He introduced the new GOP leadership team for the next two years and said he\u2019s \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opportunity to \u201ccontinue to serve.\u201d The leadership team now also includes GOP Sen. Steve Daines as the new NRSC chair replacing Sen. Rick Scott. In discussion about the midterm elections, McConnell also noted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t used to like the runoff in Georgia\u201d but he\u2019s pleased it now gives them \u201ca second chance\u201d to win the seat in December. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to get Hershel Walker elected,\u201d he said. Republican Sen. Rick Scott said in a statement\u00a0that the Senate GOP campaign arm\u00a0he runs\u00a0is \u201cmore than happy\u201d to discuss its spending with senators after\u00a0Politico\u00a0reported that a couple of lawmakers \u2014 Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Thom Tillis \u2014 privately called for an audit of the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Tuesday.\u00a0 Scott urged the\u00a0two Mitch McConnell-aligned outside groups\u00a0Senate Leadership Fund and One Nation\u00a0to \u201cdo the same.\u201d Scott also said there were \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in unauthorized and improper bonuses paid to outgoing staff after the majority was lost in 2020.\u201d \u201cWhen that\u2019s your starting point, you work really hard to make sure there are transparent processes,\u201d he added. In response to Scott\u2019s charge about \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in unauthorized and improper bonuses\u201d for 2020 NRSC staffers, Kevin McLaughlin, the NRSC executive director for the 2020 election cycle, said: \u201cThis is what children do when they are caught with their hand in the cookie jar, they lash out. Obviously, this is crazy, and we welcome a full-scale audit.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday told reporters that he and GOP Leader Mitch McConnell have been making \u201cremarkably similar\u201d statements on why Republicans didn\u2019t do as well in the midterm elections as many in the party predicted they would. \u201cWhat Senator McConnell said yesterday, and what I've been saying are remarkably similar \u2013 take a look,\u201d Schumer said on Wednesday, referring to remarks McConnell made at his policy news conference on Tuesday to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. On Tuesday, McConnell told Raju that he believes \u201cwe underperformed among independents and moderates because their impression of many of the people in our party and leadership roles is that they\u2019re engulfed in chaos, negativity and excessive attacks, and it frightened independent and moderate Republican voters.\u201d Schumer\u2019s office pointed CNN to remarks he made making a similar point on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d earlier this week where he said moderate Republican voters were \u201cafraid of this MAGA\u201d movement. \u201cIt's different this time cause they lost,\u201d he said. \"They all expected to win. The red wave proved to be a red mirage. And one \u2014 if not the main reason, but one of the main reasons for sure \u2014 was that average American folks, even those in the middle, even those who tended to be Republican said, \u2018I'm afraid of this MAGA. They're trying to ruin our Democracy.\u2019 It's not, if you look at the numbers, if you look at the results, House and Senate, the MAGA Republican way didn't work. The MAGA Republican candidates across the board, you just showed some of them, lost. So, if you're a good leader of a Republican party, you say continuing to follow them is a path to disaster.\u201d What\u2019s taking so long to determine which party has control of the US House? Blame the whole vote-by-mail West Coast, really. Actually, don\u2019t blame them. This is just\u00a0how elections work\u00a0in 2022. Blame an evenly divided electorate: If elections weren\u2019t so close, it wouldn\u2019t take so long to figure out who won. As of this writing, CNN has still not projected who will control the House in large part because of close races on the West Coast. West Coast nail-biters: Here\u2019s a look at the 11 House races for which there is no projection as of this writing. You\u2019ll notice the western bias: California \u2013 6\nColorado \u2013 2\nOregon \u2013 1 Two additional outstanding House races are in Alaska and Maine, where determining the winner in a\u00a0ranked-choice voting system\u00a0takes longer. That\u00a0means we know results for the vast majority of the elections that concluded Tuesday. Some races in California could take weeks: The West Coast has been taking a long time to count these votes for years, but the process is getting added scrutiny this year because those unprojected races will determine who controls the chambers of Congress. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner talked to California\u2019s top election official\u00a0back in 2018, when officials there were still counting ballots and it was not clear who would win a race more than\u00a0three weeks after Election Day. The official\u00a0canvass\u00a0isn\u2019t due for a month after Election Day in California because the state\u00a0wants to be sure to count every vote. The voters have spoken. This is just the counting: Meantime, look for periodic evening dumps of additional votes that could change the momentum of these extremely tight races. If the races were not so close, there might not be enough of these mail-in ballots to make a difference in the final tally. News organizations won\u2019t project a winner unless there is a certainty of victory. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida will challenge Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for his powerful post after the\u00a0Republicans failed to win back the majority\u00a0despite a favorable political environment. Scott has little chance of succeeding \u2013 even though it\u2019s the first real opponent McConnell has faced in his 15 years as the longest-serving GOP leader. Senate Republicans are expected to hold leadership elections Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m running for leader,\u201d said Scott, a first-term senator and former governor. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the status quo and so I think we ought to have an option.\u201d Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee,\u00a0has had a long-simmering conflict with McConnell\u00a0over messaging, outlook and how to spend resources this election cycle. The two have disagreed over the quality of their candidates, whether to engage in GOP primaries, whether to put forward an agenda or keep the focus on President Joe Biden, and where to compete. Asked about Scott\u2019s attacks about his refusal to lay out a policy agenda, McConnell pushed back, and instead pointed to unnamed people in the party who are \u201cengulfed in chaos, negativity and excessive attacks,\u201d adding that \u201cit frightened independent and moderate Republican voters.\u201d McConnell also again\u00a0pointed to \u201ccandidate quality\u201d as an issue\u00a0in key races. Last week, Steven Law, the president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a McConnell-aligned super PAC, suggested that the GOP re-evaluate the NRSC\u2019s \u201chands-off approach to primaries\u201d in an effort to elect candidates who will perform better in the general election.\u00a0A NRSC spokesman responded, \u201cAnyone who hates our candidates hates the Republican voters who chose them.\u201d But after getting burned in 2010 and 2012 primaries, McConnell has held a different view. \u201cWe learned some lessons about this, and I think the lesson\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d said McConnell on Tuesday. \u201cSenate races are different. Candidate quality, you recall I said in August, is important. In most of our states we met that test, in a few of them we did not.\u201d Former President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two non-consecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. \u201cIn order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\u201d Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered. Surrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. To evoke nostalgia for his time in office among Republicans who have shown signs of Trump fatigue following the midterms, he frequently contrasted his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration\u2019s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments \u2013 from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives \u2013 remain deeply polarizing to this day. As Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate \u201ca politician or conventional candidate\u201d if it wants to win back the White House. \u201cThis will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP\u2019s underwhelming\u00a0midterm elections\u00a0performance \u2013 including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers \u2013 and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks. Trump\u2019s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.

  "text": "Our live coverage of the 2022 midterm elections has moved. You can follow the latest news and results here. Former President\u00a0Donald Trump has launched\u00a0another White House bid. Prosecutors, investigators and lawmakers in Washington, DC, New York, Georgia, Florida and across the United States are among those who will be interested in what Trump has to say about the myriad legal issues facing the former president, his business and his allies. Multiple federal and state investigations are ongoing regarding the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, his handling of sensitive government documents and his family business. Trump and his company deny any wrongdoing or criminality in all matters, state and federal, and have aggressively maintained innocence. Trump has also won dismissals of two lawsuits this week in cases brought by his niece and his former attorney. Here\u2019s an updated list of notable investigations, lawsuits and controversies: Mar-a-Lago documents: Did Trump mishandle classified material? The\u00a0Justice Department investigation\u00a0continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents. The National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records. 2020 Election and Jan. 6 insurrection: Probes by the House select committee: The House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack has uncovered dramatic evidence of Trump\u2019s actions before and on Jan. 6, especially efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election. The committee is expected to issue a report before the end of the year, presumably marking the end of its investigation \u2014 especially if the Republicans take over the House of Representatives.  2020 Election and Jan. 6 insurrection: Justice Department investigation: The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While the DOJ has not acted publicly during the\u00a0so-called quiet period\u00a0leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses. Recently, the DOJ\u00a0moved to compel additional testimony\u00a0from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin. Read about the other notable legal obstacles Trump faces here.  Republicans are one seat away from winning the 218 seats necessary to claim a House majority, according to CNN projections. As control of the House still hangs in the balance, the GOP on Tuesday voted to nominate California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader since 2019, for speaker.\u00a0 Here's where things stand right now in House races: \u00a0 House seats held by Republicans: 217\nHouse seats held by Democrats: 207\nNumber of uncalled House races: 11 Democrats would need to win all of the 11 remaining races to retain control.

Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area \u2013 which is near where Obama\u2019s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, \u201cformer President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.\u201d\u00a0 NARA has also debunked Trump\u2019s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states. In those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents\u2019 permanent libraries will eventually be located.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America. \u00a0 \u201cThe worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn't take them,\u201d Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0It\u2019s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn\u2019t take back their citizens during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, though there were\u00a0some individual exceptions. \u00a0 In\u00a02016, just prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on\u00a0the list of countries\u00a0that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \u201crecalcitrant,\u201d or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals. \u00a0 For\u00a0the 2016 fiscal year, Obama\u2019s last full fiscal year in office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019,\u00a0here.\u00a0 As he has on other occasions during President Joe Biden\u2019s tenure, former President Donald Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas on Tuesday night.  He said: \u201cWe were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it's sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it's gonna go really bad.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: This is misleading. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump\u2019s last day in office, Jan. 20, 2021, was much higher than that -- $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average today is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices, as usual, has an average of $5.423.\u00a0 Minutes after Donald Trump announced another run for the White House, Ivanka Trump released a statement to CNN, saying she didn't plan to be involved in the campaign.\u00a0 CNN was first to\u00a0report\u00a0last week that Trump's daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, would not campaign on behalf of Donald Trump.\u00a0 \u201cWhile I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside of the political arena,\u201d said Trump, who did not attend Donald Trump\u2019s announcement at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday evening. \u201cThis time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family.\u201d\u00a0 She added: \"I am grateful to have had the honor of serving the American people and I will always be proud of many of our Administration\u2019s accomplishments.\" \u00a0 Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was \u201csent in probably by Russia\u201d landed 50 miles into Poland. \u201cPeople are going absolutely wild and crazy and they\u2019re not happy,\u201d Trump said from Mar-a-Lago. \u00a0 Facts First: This claim is false. While Poland says a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border. \u00a0 Additionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\u00a0 Incumbent\u00a0Democratic Rep. Josh Harder will win in California's 9th District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Tom Patti. This is a Democratic hold.  Here is where things stand now in House races:  House seats held by Republicans: 217\nHouse seats held by Democrats: 207\nNumber of uncalled House races: 11 Republicans are one seat away from winning the 218 seats necessary to claim a House majority, according to CNN projections. Former President Donald Trump claimed in his speech Tuesday that unnamed people aren\u2019t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said \u201cthey say may affect us in 300 years.\u201d He added, \u201cThey say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don't worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false -- even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren\u2019t paying attention to nuclear threats because they\u2019re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government\u2019s National Ocean Service says on its website that \u201csea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).\u201d  \u00a0 And though Trump didn\u2019t use the words \u201cclimate change\u201d in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say\u00a0climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: \u201cIncreasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.\u201d\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no \u201cdrug problem\u201d at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, \u201cif you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That\u2019s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0Trump's claim is not true, just as it was when he\u00a0made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University\u2019s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that\u00a0\u201cyes, China has a drug problem\u201d and that \u201cChina, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.\u201d The Chinese government has itself\u00a0reported\u00a0that \u201cthere were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide\u201d as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have\u00a0acknowledged\u00a0that the number of registered drug users is a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\u00a0\u00a0 And while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China\u2019s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government\u00a0also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\u00a0 See photos from the event where former President Donald Trump announced that he will be seeking the Republican Party's nomination for the 2024 election. See more photos of Trump's life and career. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Jim Costa will win California's 21st District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Michael Maher. This is a Democratic hold.  Republican Rep. Ken Calvert will win in California's 41st District, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Will Rollins. This is a Republican hold.  Former President Donald Trump addressed the disappointing Republican showing in the midterms during his presidential announcement tonight, deflecting blame by saying that voters had not appreciated the gravity of the pain the nation was enduring.  \"Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better and frankly, much of this blame is correct. But the citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through and the total effect of the suffering is just starting to take hold.\u00a0They don\u2019t quite feel it yet. But they will very soon,\" the former president said during his 2024 candidacy announcement from Mar-a-Lago in Florida.  He went on to predict a different outcome in 2024. \"I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see much more clearly what happened and what is happening to our country and the voting will be much different,\" Trump said.  Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.  \u201cPerhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort.  Facts First: Trump\u2019s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been\u00a0worth about $7.1 billion\u00a0\u2014 a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0is not any basis for Trump\u2019s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have\u00a0previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump claimed his administration \u201cfilled up\u201d\u00a0the Strategic Petroleum Reserve\u00a0but it has now been \u201cvirtually drained\u201d by the\u00a0Biden administration. \u00a0 Facts First: Both parts of Trump\u2019s claim are false. He didn\u2019t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not currently \u201cvirtually drained.\u201d\u00a0 Though Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually\u00a0contained fewer barrels\u00a0of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That\u2019s not all because of him \u2014 the law requires\u00a0some mandatory sales from the reserve\u00a0for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump\u2019s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity \u2014\u00a0but nonetheless, it didn\u2019t get filled.\u00a0 As CNN\u2019s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in\u00a0mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down\u00a0in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0(and, coincidentally or not,\u00a0prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had\u00a0more than 396 million barrels of crude oil\u00a0as of the week ending Nov. 4.\u00a0 As his predecessor announced a third run for the White House, President Joe Biden tweeted: \"Donald Trump failed America.\" The tweet from Biden's official account included a video lambasting Trump's record in office, including his economic, jobs, health care, \"coddling extremists,\" \"attacking women's rights,\" and \"inciting a violent mob.\" The message came midway through Trump's announcement speech from Mar-a-Lago. Biden also sent a text message fundraising appeal to the Democratic National Committee's text list. \"It's President Biden, and this is urgent. Trump just announced he's running for president again. Can you rush $20 to the DNC? txt.democrats.org/fg2\" the text said. Former President Donald Trump boasted about his tariffs on China during his speech Tuesday, claiming, \u201cno president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First: As we have written repeatedly, it\u2019s\u00a0not true\u00a0that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality,\u00a0the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2019 that the US generated an \"average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\"  Also, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments \u2014 and\u00a0study\u00a0after\u00a0study\u00a0during Trump\u2019s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump announced another run for the White House in remarks from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.\u00a0 \"In order to make America great\u00a0and glorious again, I am tonight\u00a0announcing my candidacy for\u00a0president of the United States,\" Trump said. Trump\u2019s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement. Trump\u2019s long-awaited campaign comes as the former president tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP\u2019s underwhelming\u00a0midterm elections\u00a0performance \u2013 including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers \u2013 and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks. But Trump is also betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others \u2013 like his former Vice President, Mike Pence \u2013 may proceed anyway. Read more about Trump's 2024 bid here and hear him announce his candidacy below: White House officials were expecting a split screen moment this week as President Joe Biden met world leaders in Bali at the same moment as his predecessor was expected to announce a third presidential run. But the dynamic has only been amplified as Biden convenes emergency talks with world leaders about explosions in Poland the same hour Trump loyalists fill the Mar-a-Lago ballroom for the former president's announcement. Biden was leading the crisis talks with members of the G7 and NATO in Bali \u2014 two groupings Trump questioned the usefulness of when he was in office.\u00a0 \"There was total unanimity among the folks at the table,\" Biden said emerging from the talks. Less than 10 minutes later, Trump walked into stage at Mar-a-Lago. Heading into the trip, Biden\u2019s advisers were not particularly concerned about the split-screen \u2014 and after Democrats\u2019 election success were even less wary of Trump announcing a third bid for president while Biden was in Asia. For one, Biden officials are happy to take the comparison between the current president and the former on the foreign stage, given the general chaos that often trailed Trump as he traveled abroad. Trump\u2019s announcement will surely prompt renewed attention on Biden\u2019s on decision-making on running for reelection. By all accounts, including from his closest advisers, Biden will feel more propelled to seek a second term if Trump is in contention. But, for Biden, the timing could not have been more opportune. The prospect of a midterm wipeout loomed over preparations for his around-the-world trip over the last several weeks. Widespread Republican wins \u2014 including by election deniers \u2014 would badly complicate the president\u2019s bedrock message that Democracies will win out against autocracies. Trump\u2019s tease of a campaign announcement at the very moment Biden would be rallying the world behind democratic ideals only elevated the stakes.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump is speaking from his Mar-a-Lago\u00a0resort in Florida and is expected to announce his third presidential run. Before his remarks tonight, Trump filed paperwork establishing his candidacy to run for the presidency again in 2024. Aides say Trump is hoping his early entry into the 2024 presidential primary will reframe the conversation away from Republican failures and inject a fresh dose of enthusiasm into a demoralized party amid the failure to capture Senate control or win a sizable House majority.  CNN has yet to project which party will win control of the House, but as of late Tuesday, the GOP was closing in on gaining a slim majority. Though the former president has been touting his 200-plus victories on Election Night, many of the Trump-endorsed Republicans who prevailed ran uncontested or were widely expected to win their contests, And several Senate candidates he endorsed in highly prized races failed to dethrone their Democratic opponents or flip open seats into the GOP\u2019s column. On Saturday, CNN projected that Democrats will retain control of the Senate in the 118th Congress, an outcome that has fractured Republicans and left the party on tenterhooks as Trump readies his \u201cbig announcement.\u201d Former President Donald Trump has filed his paperwork establishing his candidacy to run for the presidency again in 2024.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s paperwork landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he is scheduled to make his announcement at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida waterfront estate Tuesday evening. On the brink of a campaign launch that elicits both enthusiasm and dread from different corners of his own party, Trump\u2019s quest to return to the Oval Office could face untold obstacles in the months to come, even with his loyal base firmly intact.  He has spent the days since the midterm elections fending off criticism from fellow Republicans over his ill-fated involvement in key contests, furiously lashing out at two GOP heavyweights who could complicate his path to the White House if they mount their own presidential campaigns, and fretting that he or associates could soon be indicted by federal investigators in two separate Justice Department probes. Tuesday\u2019s scheduled ranked-choice voting tabulation for Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District will be delayed after ballot data on memory sticks from two municipalities, Bangor and Hampden, couldn\u2019t be read, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced. The paper ballots now need to be retrieved and then rescanned. The ranked-choice tabulation is now scheduled for Wednesday, according to the secretary of state\u2019s official\u00a0Twitter account Democratic Rep. Jared Golden currently leads former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin among first-choice votes, but he\u2019s short of the majority needed to win outright. During the ranked-choice tabulation voters who voted for the third place candidate, independent Tiffany Bond, will have their votes reallocated to the candidate they ranked as their second choice. Former New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris\u00a0Christie\u00a0was applauded on Tuesday after suggesting that former president Donald Trump bears the blame for the GOP's disappointing midterm performance.\u00a0 Speaking at the annual Republican Governors Association summit,\u00a0Christie\u00a0said the party has fallen short in the last three election cycles because Trump was front-and-center or a candidate himself.  A person familiar with his comments and the reaction from the donors, consultants, and GOP operatives in the room said\u00a0Christie\u00a0received sustained applause.\u00a0 Christie, a potential 2024 challenger to Trump, said voters rejected candidates who embraced \"crazy\" positions and Trump's lies about the 2020 election, the source said.\u00a0 Christie\u00a0also blamed Trump for elevating flawed candidates that he claimed were doomed to fail in certain races, including Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial hopeful Doug Mastriano.\u00a0\u00a0 Axios first reported\u00a0Christie's comments on Tuesday.\u00a0 Christie's comments come hours before Trump is expected to announce a 2024 presidential campaign, running for the White House for the third time and potentially entering a primary that could soon become crowded with anti-Trump rivals like the former New Jersey governor.\u00a0 What races are left to be projected: There are 14 races remaining, but Republicans only need to win two more to win control of the House. Right now, Republicans hold 216 seats \u2014\u00a0they need 218 to take a majority of the chamber. Democrats have won 205 seats so far, meaning they need to win 13 of the remaining races. There are nine uncalled House races in California, the most populous state in the country. Counting there could take weeks because the official canvass is not due for a month after Election Day.\nTwo races are still too close to call in Colorado, including in the 3rd District where Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert is in a surprisingly tight race, leading by just over 1,000 votes with about 99% of ballots in.\nAlaska and Maine still have one race each to call. Both states use a ranked-choice voting system.\nOregon also has not yet projected the winner in its 6th Congressional District. The state conducts its elections entirely by mail. House GOP leadership elections: The\u00a0House Republican conference\u00a0voted for House Minority Leader\u00a0Kevin McCarthy\u00a0to be its leader after an underwhelming midterm election performance launched a search among conservatives for a challenger. The vote puts McCarthy in line to be the next speaker of the House, if Republicans win control of the chamber. McCarthy won 188-31 against Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, according to multiple sources in the room. It was a secret ballot, and McCarthy only needed to earn a simple majority of the conference.\nOther roles in House GOP leadership were also decided. The No. 2 House Republican, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, won his election to serve as House majority leader without facing any opposition. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the National Republican Congressional Committee chair, was voted House majority whip. Senate leadership vote: In the Senate, Sen. Rick Scott of Florida will challenge Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for his powerful leadership position. Democrats kept control of the chamber, according to CNN projections. Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee,\u00a0has had a long-simmering conflict with McConnell\u00a0over messaging, outlook and how to spend resources this election cycle.\u00a0 McConnell responded that he had repeatedly called control of the Senate a \u201cjump ball\u201d ahead of the election, adding \u201cI never predicted a red wave.\u201d He said he is confident he has enough votes to keep his post. Ahead tonight: Former President Donald Trump is set to speak from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET. He is expected to announce his third presidential run during the remarks. Aides say Trump is hoping his early entry into the 2024 presidential primary will reframe the conversation away from Republican failures and inject a fresh dose of enthusiasm into a demoralized party amid GOP failures to capture Senate control and win a sizable House majority.\u00a0 Facebook\u2019s fact-checkers will need to stop fact-checking\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0if he announces that he is running for president, according to a company memo obtained by CNN. While Trump is currently\u00a0banned from Facebook, the fact-check ban applies to anything Trump says and false statements made by Trump can be posted to the platform by others. Despite Trump\u2019s ban, \u201cTeam Trump,\u201d a page run by Trump\u2019s political group, is still active and has 2.3 million followers. Tuesday\u2019s memo from Meta underscores the challenges social media platforms face in deciding how to handle another potential Trump presidential campaign. The former president is widely expected to announce his third presidential bid on Tuesday. Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta pays third-party fact-checking organizations to apply fact-check labels to misinformation across Facebook and Instagram. The carve-out is not exclusive to Trump and applies to all politicians, but given the rate fact-checkers find themselves dealing with claims made by the former president, a manager on Meta\u2019s \u201cnews integrity partnership\u201d team emailed fact-checkers on Tuesday. \u201cSome of you have reached out seeking guidance regarding fact-checking political speech in anticipation of a potential candidacy announcement from former President Trump,\u201d the Meta staffer wrote. The company has long had an exception to its fact-checking policy for politicians. \u201cIt is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,\u201d Meta executive Nick Clegg, a former politician,\u00a0said in 2019, defending the exemption. The Meta memo sent to fact-checkers made clear that if Trump\u00a0announced a 2024 presidential bit Tuesday night, he could no longer be fact-checked on the platform. Read more about the memo here.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who reiterated he has the votes to be reelected as leader, gave his first extensive take on the Republicans\u2019 lackluster performance in the midterms.\u00a0\u00a0 Asked about Republican Sen. Rick Scott's attacks that his refusal to lay out a policy agenda exposed GOP candidates in key races, McConnell pushed back, and instead pointed to unnamed people in the party who are \u201cengulfed in chaos, negativity and excessive attacks,\u201d adding that \u201cit frightened independent and moderate Republican voters.\u201d\u00a0 He once again pointed to \u201ccandidate quality\u201d as an issue in key races.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe learned some lessons about this, and I think the lesson\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSenate races are different. Candidate quality, you recall I said in August, is important. In most of our states we met that test, in a few of them we did not.\u201d\u00a0 McConnell also reminded reporters that he had repeatedly called control of the Senate a \u201cjump ball\u201d ahead of the election.\u00a0 \u201cI never predicted a red wave. We never saw that in any of our polling in the states that we were counting on to win. There was no wave,\u201d he said. McConnell insisted once again that he will be reelected as leader by his conference, but did not rule out delaying the leadership votes expected on Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cI think the outcome is pretty clear. I want to repeat again, I have the votes, I will be elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only issue is whether we do it sooner or later, and I think we\u2019ll probably have another discussion about that tomorrow.\u201d A panel of Republican governors assembled Tuesday in Florida to discuss the future of the GOP avoided the biggest question mark hanging over the party: Donald Trump.\u00a0 The former president was barely mentioned by name during an hour-long discussion at the Republican Governors Association (RGA) in Orlando \u2014 taking place just hours before Trump is expected to make an announcement about his 2024 plans in the same state. But Republican leaders shared a vision for the party that diverges from the incendiary politics of the Trump era.\u00a0 Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire said the party needs to be \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cinspirational.\u201d South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Republicans too often relied on the \u201cinstant gratification feedback\u201d that comes from saying \u201cthis crazy thing and it\u2019s going to get me one big news flash and then not do anything that helps win an election.\u201d \u201cWe did a lot of talking,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe have to do more than just saying there\u2019s a clear difference of choices.\u201d Gov. Bill of Tennessee said there is a \u201creal hunger in this country for competent leadership that is driven by a passion to change people's lives\u201d and carried out through \u201cgrace and humility.\u201d \u201cI believe our children learn a lot by what we say and what we do and they especially mimic and learn by how we treat other people and there's not much inspiring about the way we treat people in politics,\u201d Lee said, earning him applause.\u00a0 Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, the chairman of the RGA, moderated and didn\u2019t ask about Trump, instead steering the conversation toward policy topics where Republicans believe they\u2019re winning. School choice, lower taxes and fostering business development were often discussed.\u00a0 The panel participants, which also included Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, represented a cross-section of politically successful Republican governors from across the country who coasted to reelection last week.\u00a0 Democrat Gabriel\u00a0Vasquez will defeat Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell in New Mexico\u2019s competitive 2nd Congressional District race, CNN projects.\u00a0 This is a Democratic pickup. Either party needs 218 seat to have a majority in the House. Here's where things stand in the race for the chamber:  Current House seats controlled by Republicans: 216\nCurrent House seats controlled by Democrats: 205\nUncalled House races: 14 Republican Rep. Michelle Steel will win in California's 45th Congressional District, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Jay Chen.  This is a Republican hold.  Sen. Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, was\u00a0disinvited to their party's weekly Senate policy news conference in the wake of a tense back and forth with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, according to Scott's communications director McKinley Lewis. Scott \u2014 who is challenging McConnell for Senate GOP leader, is still the elected chair of the\u00a0National Republican Senatorial Committee which is typically represented at these news briefings.  Scott and McConnell engaged in a tense back-and-forth where they criticized each other as the two men addressed Senate Republicans in a tense three-hour meeting, according to multiple senators. \u201cSenator Scott\u00a0disagrees with the approach that Mitch has taken in this election and for the last couple of years, and he made that clear and Sen. McConnell criticized Sen. Scott's management of the NRSC,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, told reporters. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said he will offer a motion at tomorrow\u2019s meeting to delay the GOP leadership elections. The Senate GOP leadership election is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded to former President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism for the first time Tuesday during a press conference, dismissing his attacks as \"just noise\" before adding that he would\u00a0\u201cjust tell people to check out the scoreboard last Tuesday night.\u201d\u00a0 \"One of the things that I've learned in this job, when you're leading, when you are getting things done, yeah, you take incoming fire. That's just the nature of it,\" DeSantis said in Fort Walton Beach.\u00a0 \"We've focused on results and leadership. And you know at the end of the day, I would just tell people to check out the scoreboard last Tuesday night,\" he added.\u00a0 The comments mark the first time DeSantis has publicly addressed the results of the midterms since election night when his 19-point victory in Florida stood out as a rare bright spot for Republicans. In the past week, DeSantis had largely avoided situations where he could face questions about Trump or his future political ambitions.\u00a0 In the weeks leading up to the election, DeSantis declined to engage with Trump's increasing hostilities and has generally dismissed any talk about potentially running for president in 2024 as premature. But his remarks Tuesday offered an early indication of how DeSantis could frame a head-to-head campaign against Trump if he decides to run for the Republican nomination. The Florida governor acknowledged that while there were some success stories during the midterm election, he said there were also many disappointments. \"I mean, that's just the reality. It was a hugely underwhelming disappointing performance, especially given that Biden's policies are overwhelmingly unpopular,\" DeSantis said. \"People think the country is going in the wrong direction.\u00a0\" After touting his accomplishments in the state, DeSantis added, \"And so Florida, I think really shows the blueprint of what you can do to not only win but really fundamentally change the overall political terrain in a very strong pro-freedom direction. And that's what we've done here.\" Should\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0announce his third presidential bid on Tuesday, as is widely expected, he will begin the next phase of his political career under siege. Seven years ago, the New York businessman entered the political fray on defense, working vigorously to cast himself as a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination to the incredulity of veteran political operatives and his primary opponents.  This time, Trump takes the plunge as the party\u2019s indisputable frontrunner, but once again, he finds himself in a defensive crouch. On the brink of a campaign launch that elicits both enthusiasm and dread from different corners of his own party, Trump\u2019s quest to return to the Oval Office could face untold obstacles in the months to come, even with his loyal base firmly intact.  A deflection from probes: He has spent the days since the\u00a0midterm elections\u00a0fending off criticism from fellow Republicans over his ill-fated involvement in key contests, furiously lashing out at two GOP heavyweights who could complicate his path to the White House if they mount their own presidential campaigns, and fretting that he or associates could soon be indicted by federal investigators in two separate Justice Department probes. Reframing GOP upset: Aides say Trump is hoping his early entry into the 2024 presidential primary will reframe the conversation away from Republican failures and inject a fresh dose of enthusiasm into a demoralized party amid GOP failures to capture Senate control and win a sizable House majority.  Though the former president has been touting his 200-plus victories on Election Night, many of the Trump-endorsed Republicans who prevailed last Tuesday ran uncontested or were widely expected to win their contests, while several Senate candidates he endorsed in highly prized races failed to dethrone their Democratic opponents or flip open seats into the GOP\u2019s column. Mehmet Oz, Adam Laxalt and Blake Masters, three Republican Senate candidates who earned Trump\u2019s support in their primaries, respectively lost to Democratic opponents in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. Meanwhile, Herschel Walker, a longtime Trump friend challenging Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, is headed to a December runoff after both failed to reach 50% support in Georgia. On Saturday, CNN projected that Democrats will retain control of the Senate in the 118th Congress, an outcome that has fractured Republicans and left the party on tenterhooks as Trump readies his \u201cbig announcement.\u201d Read more.  Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota has emerged the winner of the House GOP whip race, the No. 3 leadership spot, defeating Reps. Jim Banks and Drew Ferguson, according to sources in the room.  Emmer won the final ballot in a head-to-head match-up with Banks, a Trump ally, 115 to 106, sources said. Emmer chaired the House GOP Campaign Committee this cycle and had faced some grumbling from colleagues in the wake of the midterm elections. Rep. Steve Scalise was elected as House Majority Leader, the No. 2 GOP leadership slot. Additionally, Rep. Elise Stefanik was reelected to serve as House GOP conference chair, defeating a challenge from conservative Rep. Byron Donalds, per sources in the room. The tally was 144-74. Earlier on Tuesday, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy won his party\u2019s nomination for speaker, beating conservative challenger Rep. Andy Biggs. Remember: CNN has still not yet projected whether Republicans will win the House. Republicans are closing in on the 218 seats needed for a House majority, but there are several races yet to be called. Republican Blake Masters called Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly this morning to congratulate him on his win in the state's Senate race, a spokesperson for Kelly confirmed to CNN.  The spokesperson said it was a pleasant call where they expressed mutual respect.  Masters also expressed admiration for Kelly's military service, according to the Kelly spokesperson. Masters\u00a0tweeted\u00a0a statement Tuesday on his loss in the Arizona Senate race, writing that \u201cthere is no path forward in my race\u201d and saying he called Kelly to congratulate him. But he also sought to cast doubt on process, writing \u201cThere were obviously a lot of problems with this election,\u201d without providing details or evidence. Masters went on to say that \u201cRepublicans are the underdogs now\u201d blaming the media, universities, big tech and \u201cwoke corporations.\u201d Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, told reporters Tuesday afternoon that he would challenge Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving Republican leader, at the conference\u2019s leadership elections tomorrow. \u201cI\u2019m running for leader,\u201d said Scott, a first-term senator and former governor. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the status quo and so I think we ought to have an option.\u201d \u201cI still think we ought to delay the [leadership] election,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to; there\u2019ll be a vote tomorrow.\u201d Scott has little chance of succeeding but it\u2019s seen as a protest vote \u2014 though it\u2019s the first real challenger McConnell has faced in his time as GOP leader. The bulk of the discussion at the Senate GOP leadership policy lunch \u2014 that started at 1 p.m. ET and is still ongoing \u2014 has been about whether to delay the leadership election slated to take place Wednesday, according to Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell walked the senators through the how much the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC associated with him, spent on Senate races this year, Cramer added. Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, said he didn\u2019t think there is much of an appetite in the conference for delaying the election and said, \u201cI think people want clarity.\u201d\u00a0 Retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio also said flatly \u201cno,\u201d when asked if he supported a delay.\u00a0 Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s campaign, joined by Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign arm as well as the Georgia Democratic Party, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging the move by state officials to prohibit early voting in the Senate runoff on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.\u00a0\u00a0 The lawsuit alleges that Georgia is \u201cunlawfully restricting the number of advance voting days counties may provide to voters for the 2022 senate runoff election.\u201d\u00a0 Warnock is facing GOP candidate Hershel Walker in the runoff, which concludes on Dec. 6, after neither candidate emerged from last week\u2019s election with 50 percent plus one of the vote.\u00a0 The Warnock campaign\u2019s lawsuit points to comments made by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his office\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Gabe Sterling indicating that counties would be allowed to offer early voting on Saturday, Nov. 26, if they so choose. \u00a0 Since those comments were made, however, Raffensperger\u2019s office has issued a memo to counties instructing them that early voting on Saturday is prohibited by a 2016 state law barring Saturday early voting after state holidays on Thursdays and/or Fridays. In this case, Thanksgiving falls on Nov. 24 and a state holiday that formerly commemorated Robert E. Lee\u2019s birthday falls on Nov. 25.\u00a0\u00a0 The Democrats contend the law in question applies only to primary and general elections, and not to run-off elections when the voting period was reduced from nine to four weeks\u00a0by a separate law passed by the Republican Georgia legislature in 2021.\u00a0 \u201cThe Secretary\u2019s insistence that counties may not hold advance voting on November 26 therefore has no support in the law,\u201d the lawsuit says, while alleging that the prohibition conflicts with a law requiring \u201cthat counties begin advance voting for the December 6 runoff as soon as possible.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The lawsuit was filed in Fulton County Superior Court. It asks for a court order that blocks Raffensperger and other state officials from taking action to prevent counties from offering early voting.\u00a0 Raffensperger said in a statement that recent elections had proven \u201cthat voters expect candidates to focus on winning at the ballot box \u2014 not at the courthouse.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSenator Warnock and his Democratic Party allies are seeking to change Georgia law right before an election based on their political preferences,\u201d Raffensperger said. \u201cInstead of muddying the water and pressuring counties to ignore Georgia law, Senator Warnock should be allowing county election officials to continue preparations for the upcoming runoff.\"\u00a0 House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy has won his party\u2019s nomination for speaker, beating conservative challenger Rep. Andy Biggs in a 188 - 31 vote, according to multiple sources in the room.  It was a secret ballot, and McCarthy only needed a simple majority.\u00a0 While Biggs\u2019 challenge was always seen as a long shot, the number of Republicans voting for him shows how much work McCarthy has to do to win over holdouts between now and January, when he will need to win a majority of the entire House.\u00a0 Remember: A week after Election Day, CNN has still not yet projected whether Republicans will win the House. Republicans are closing in on the 218 seats needed for a House majority, but there are several races yet to be called. But McCarthy was confident he would win a majority of House GOP votes on Tuesday to lead his conference \u2013 and that he will earn in January\u00a0the 218 votes necessary to hold the speaker\u2019s gavel. Three House Republicans \u2014 Kat Cammack of Florida, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania \u2014 nominated McCarthy for leader, arguing that he has worked harder than anyone, and that party unity is the only path to victory.\u00a0 Biggs, a former chair of the House Freedom Caucus, announced\u00a0on Newsmax on Monday night\u00a0that he would run against McCarthy, while acknowledging it would be \u201ctough\u201d to beat someone who has \u201craised a lot of money\u201d to elect his colleagues. Ad money is pouring into Georgia for the Dec. 6 runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, even with lowered stakes and control of the Senate already decided.\u00a0 Candidates and groups from both parties have combined to book over $16 million in advertising for the runoff \u2014 including spending so far and future reservations \u2014 and Democrats have a significant advantage, spending $12.2 million to $3.9 million from Republicans as of Tuesday.\u00a0 Warnock, the incumbent Democrat, leads all advertisers with over $6 million in ad spending so far. And his campaign is well positioned for a runoff, reporting about $10.5 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 19, in his final FEC report before the midterm elections.\u00a0 Meanwhile Walker, his GOP challenger, has spent about $2.7 million on ads for the runoff so far, while his campaign had about $5.4 million in cash on hand as of its last report.\u00a0 The other significant spending so far comes from two Democratic groups \u2014 Georgia Honor, a super PAC funded by top group Senate Majority PAC, has spent about $4.8 million so far, while American Bridge has spent about $1.3 million.\u00a0 The midterm results, which allowed Democrats to keep their Senate majority, have caused some Republicans to openly question who should lead the party moving forward ahead of leadership elections.\u00a0 Hawley says McConnell can\u2019t take GOP back to the majority Sen. Josh Hawley told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that \"clearly what we're doing isn't working\" to become the majority party. \u201cIt hasn't been working for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you look at independent voters, I mean, we gave them nothing, no alternative. That was the decision by leadership. They didn't want to have an agenda.\u201d Hawley added he\u2019d vote for Sen. Rick Scott if he challenged Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for leader, and reiterated that he believes the leadership elections should be delayed until after the Georgia runoff.\u00a0 Cruz on leadership elections: We need a leader who \"doesn't roll over immediately\" Sen. Ted Cruz criticized Senate GOP leadership for \u201ccapitulating to Democrats\u201d during the last two years, sharply criticizing their messaging strategy during this cycle.\u00a0 \u201cI believe we should have a leader that actually listens to the conference, and that is willing to stand and fight, doesn't roll over immediately,\u201d said Cruz.\u00a0 \u201cOur current leadership believes the way you win elections is that you don't stand for anything, you don't have an agenda, you don't have a plan. Instead, that the only thing you stand up and say is \u2018Well, I'm not a Democrat. So vote for me.\u2019 You know what? Election Day showed we need to be more than just not a Democrat,\u201d he said.  Cruz said it would be \u201cutterly insane\u201d to hold leadership elections tomorrow, before a postmortem of the election results. \u201cI'll tell you this, I believe if we don't delay the election, I think it is very likely that we will see someone run against Mitch McConnell,\u201d he added. Ex-Trump chief of staff says it\u2019s time for RNC chair to move on Mick Mulvaney, former acting chief of staff to President Donald Trump, told CNN's Kate\u00a0Bolduan that he is not a fan of Ronna McDaniel\u00a0running for reelection as\u00a0chairwoman of the\u00a0Republican National Committee. \"We got along well when I worked in the White House and I have no complaints about her personally. But we have a track record of losing with her in charge. Again, we lost in 2018. We lost in 2020. We didn't win like we should have last week,\" Mulvaney said on Tuesday.\u00a0 Mulvaney's comments come amid reports that McDaniel told RNC members during a conference call on Monday that she intends to seek reelection to another term, according to people familiar with the call.\u00a0 Thune expects \"candid conversation\" at GOP lunch Senate Republican Whip John Thune said he expects a \u201ccandid conversation\u201d when members of the GOP conference meet for lunch Tuesday to assess why they had lackluster election results and to begin the process of deciding who their elected leadership team will be for the next Congress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI expect leaders will be able to make their voices heard like we always do.\u00a0But I also expect a lot of our members \u2014 who tend in most cases to be vocal at these lunches \u2014 to be vocal today.\u00a0We\u2019ll see where it goes,\u201d Thune told reporters in the Capitol.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s good.\u00a0We need these candid conversations, certainly within the family as we think about charting the future, learning from the past, being informed by the past, but getting ready for the future.\u201d\u00a0 Thune also said he hoped former President Donald Trump would have waited until after the Georgia Senate runoff to announce another presidential election bid, which he is expected to do tonight.\u00a0\u00a0 Republican Adam Laxalt called Democratic Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto to concede, he said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cMoving forward, we need to better adjust to our new election laws or we need to work to fix them. But I am confident that any challenge of this election would not alter the ultimate outcome. That is why this morning I called Catherine Cortez Masto to congratulate her on her win,\u201d Laxalt said. See his tweet: Rep.\u00a0Jim Clyburn, the No. 3 leader in the Democratic caucus, told CNN he plans to \u201cstay in leadership\u201d if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decides to step aside. But he said that he won\u2019t run for the top Democratic spot. There have been a lot of questions about Clyburn\u2019s next steps because they will affect the leader spots down the line. Clyburn said: \u201cI plan to stay in leadership.\u201d\u00a0 Asked in what capacity, he said: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d Asked if would be the top job, he said: \u201cNo, it won\u2019t be that.\u201d Pelosi did not address her future in Tuesday's caucus meeting,\u00a0multiple sources tell CNN. On a separate note, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said during the caucus meeting Democrats want to try to pass DREAM Act during the lame-duck session, sources also told CNN.\u00a0\u00a0 President Biden made congratulatory calls to Arizona Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs and Rep. Susie Lee, both Democrats recently projected to win their races, after his first G20 working session in Bali, Indonesia. The president also called to congratulate Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, the White House said Tuesday.\u00a0 New Hampshire voted for common sense, individual rights, democracy and an economy that works for everyone, re-elected Sen. Maggie Hassan told CNN Tuesday. \"I think what we heard from\u00a0Granite State voters last week\u00a0was a really resounding vote for\u00a0common sense,\" she said. \"They really want us\u00a0to work together.\u00a0We got a lot of challenges\u00a0ahead.\u00a0We got to build an economy that\u00a0works for everybody, we got to\u00a0protect our democracy, protect\u00a0individual freedoms.\" Hassan emphasized needing to address inflation, as well as the cost of energy and drug prescriptions. \"I think people know that we need\u00a0to work together to address\u00a0inflation, for instance, which\u00a0is really hurting families and\u00a0small businesses all across my\u00a0state and across the country.\u00a0We have taken some steps to\u00a0begin to lower costs on things\u00a0like prescription drugs, and\u00a0energy.\u00a0We need to do more right now,\u00a0this winter, on home heating\u00a0expenses, especially in my neck\u00a0of the woods,\" Hassan said. While campaigning, Hassan said she heard voters' concerns about women's health care rights. \"They also care a lot about\u00a0individual freedoms,\u00a0particularly a woman's right to\u00a0make her own healthcare\u00a0decisions,\" she told CNN, adding that a voter told her campaign volunteer that he will vote so he could make \"sure his granddaughter would have the\u00a0same rights that her mother did.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is hoping to pass a crucial test on Tuesday in his campaign to become House speaker despite an\u00a0underwhelming midterm election performance\u00a0that launched a search among conservatives for a challenger. A week after Election Day, CNN has still not yet projected whether Republicans will win the House. But McCarthy is confident that he will win a majority of House GOP votes on Tuesday to lead his conference \u2013 and will earn in January\u00a0the 218 votes necessary to hold the speaker\u2019s gavel. He\u2019ll face at least one opponent: Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. Biggs announced\u00a0on Newsmax on Monday night\u00a0that he would run against McCarthy, while acknowledging it would be \u201ctough\u201d to beat someone who has \u201craised a lot of money\u201d to elect his colleagues. \u201cThis is not just about Kevin,\u201d said Biggs. \u201cI think it\u2019s about institutional direction and trajectory.\u201d Before Biggs\u2019 announcement, McCarthy and House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, who is running to be majority leader, attempted to quell the tensions vibrating within the party on Monday. McCarthy met with several members of the House Freedom Caucus on Monday, and Scalise apologized at a meeting to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for privately criticizing him in the immediate wake of January 6, 2021, according to sources in the room. Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson said he\u2019ll support McCarthy for leader, noting the GOP gained House seats the last two elections. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cThere were factors beyond what Kevin McCarthy could deal with that affected this election,\u201d he added. Some members of the far-right appeared assuaged. \u201cIf we don\u2019t unify behind Kevin McCarthy, we\u2019re opening up the door for the Democrats to be able to recruit some of our Republicans,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Even before Biggs jumped in the ring, House members predicted that McCarthy would face a challenger who would expose that the California Republican does not currently enjoy enough support to become speaker next year.

Catherine Cortez Masto, whose\u00a0recent reelection denied Republicans\u00a0the chance to control the Senate, said Democrats cannot take any area  for granted moving forward. \u201cWe can\u2019t take any community for granted, and we have to not only constantly outreach, but we have to follow up and we have to engage and talk to them and listen to the issues that matter to them,\u201d Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator, told CNN when asked about the role of Latino voters in her successful bid for reelection. Cortez Masto\u2019s reelection, which\u00a0CNN projected Saturday evening, marked a critical victory for Senate Democrats, allowing the party to keep control of the chamber. The Nevada Democrat had long been viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fended off a challenge from former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt in a state whose economy had been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and inflation. One of the biggest challenges she faced is that much of Nevada\u2019s population is transient \u2013 meaning many voters had not gotten to know Cortez Masto or her record. But Cortez Masto found support with what she called \u201ckitchen table issues.\u201d Throughout the campaign, she focused on Democrats\u2019 legislative efforts to reduce Americans\u2019 costs, including on health care and prescription drugs, while trying to tie her Republican opponent to \u201cbig oil.\u201d Cortez Masto also tried to remind voters of Laxalt\u2019s history as one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign co-chairs and accused him of pushing an \u201cextreme agenda\u201d and the kind of conspiracy theories that she said fueled the storming of the US Capitol on\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s all about working families, making sure we\u2019re fighting for them always,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s an important message for so many people to understand in Nevada.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston contributed to this report. Democrat Katie Hobbs will win Arizona\u2019s governor\u2019s race, CNN projects, defeating one of the most prominent defenders of former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election.\u00a0 Calling the 2020 election rigged, Republican Kari Lake had repeatedly said she would not have certified Joe Biden\u2019s win in Arizona in 2020. Hobbs, as Arizona\u2019s secretary of state,\u00a0had rejected GOP lies about the election.\u00a0 Lake\u2019s defeat follows the defeat of two other high-profile election deniers in the state \u2013 Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters and secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem.\u00a0 Before the projection, Lake had already begun sowing doubts about the 2022 results.  During an appearance on right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's talk show Thursday, she said, \"I hate that they're slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable. They don't want to put out the truth, which is that we won.\" \u00a0\u00a0 There is no evidence that the election officials were delaying the reporting of results.\u00a0At a news conference Thursday, Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, called out Lake\u2019s comments. \u201cIt is offensive for\u00a0Kari\u00a0Lake\u00a0to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours,\u201d Gates, a Republican, said, gesturing to the election workers who were involved in tallying the ballots behind him through a glass window. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lake, a former news anchor at Fox 10 in Phoenix, ascended quickly to become one of the most prominent Republicans in the 2022 cycle as she and Hobbs vied to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The outgoing governor had endorsed Lake\u2019s primary opponent, but then backed Lake in the general election. \u00a0\u00a0 Hobbs, a former social worker who worked with victims of domestic violence before becoming a state lawmaker, ran a far more low-key and understated campaign, limiting her access to reporters and holding small, intimate events with supporters. She made democracy and abortion rights her\u00a0central focus, portraying Lake as an \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d figure who could jeopardize the sanctity of the 2024 presidential election by refusing to certify the results.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rep. Andy Biggs confirmed tonight that he will challenge Kevin McCarthy to lead the House GOP conference and possibly become Speaker of the House if Republicans take control of the chamber. \"I\u2019m going to be nominated tomorrow to the position of Speaker of the House. We\u2019ll see if we can get the job done and the votes. It\u2019s going to be tough. Kevin has raised a lot of money and done a lot of things. But this is not just about Kevin. I think it\u2019s about institutional direction and trajectory,: Biggs said on Newsmax. CNN has not yet projected which party will control the House. Some context: The vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans are holding their internal leadership elections to pick a speaker nominee this week. Biggs\u2019 challenge is meant to demonstrate that McCarthy lacks 218 votes to become speaker in January \u2014 if the GOP wins control of the House \u2014 an effort by the hard-line Freedom Caucus to force the GOP leader to make concessions to weaken his potential speakership and empower the rank-and-file.\u00a0"

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday. \"We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe \u2013 we\u2019ll start seeing those come in,\" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.  Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix. The mail-in ballots dropped off were a record for the county, Gates said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of ballots that people are trying to process, but we\u2019re going to get through it. We\u2019re going to do it on a timeline that\u2019s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.\u201d Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona\u2019s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,\u201d he said. On Thursday, Maricopa County staff verified nearly all of the 290,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day. It updated an additional tranche of just over 78,000 ballots on Thursday night.\ufffd\ufffd The estimated ballots remaining, according to the county, include: 17,000 Election Day ballots to be reported\n68,928 early ballots left to process and tabulate\n29,153 early ballots left to verify\n2,878 provisional ballots left to research out of 7,885 total ##Arizona## Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier wins reelection against Republican challenger Matt Larkin in Washington state's 8th Congressional District, CNN projects, as she overcomes blistering attacks on crime and the economy. CNN now projects Democrats have 198 seats of 218 required to control the House. CNN projects Republicans have 211 seats. Democrat Rep. Dina Titus will defeat Republican Mark Robertson in Nevada's 1st Congressional District, according to CNN projections.  In addition, Democrat Rep. Steven Horsford will defeat Republican Sam Peters in  Nevada's 4th Congressional District, according to the projections. Both victories are holds for the Democratic Party. CNN now projects Democrats have 197 of 218 seats required to control the House. CNN also projects Republicans have 211 seats. Voters in five states on Tuesday were asked whether to update their states\u2019 constitutions to remove\u00a0slavery and indentured servitude\u00a0as potential punishments.\u00a0In four of the five states, voters agreed to strike the punishment from the books, CNN projects, while the effort fell short in one. Although the\u00a013th Amendment\u00a0to the US Constitution prohibited slavery in 1865, it allowed an exception \u201cfor crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,\u201d and the proposed amendments asked voters to either explicitly rule out slavery and indentured servitude as potential punishments or remove the terms from state law altogether.\u00a0 Voters in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont approved ballot measures to amend their state's constitutions accordingly. However, Louisiana voters rejected an amendment that would have changed the state\u2019s constitution by explicitly prohibiting the punishments, CNN projects.\u00a0 You can read more about the specific ballot measures here.  At the first runoff campaign event, Republican Senate candidate Herschel\u00a0Walker was joined by Sen. Ted Cruz with both men boldly predicting a GOP win in the runoff election.\u00a0 Addressing a crowd of hundreds of supporters\u00a0in Canton, Georgia, Walker said, \u201cWe are in overtime. We got a runoff. I was built for this. God prepared me for this moment right here.\u201d\u00a0 Canton, about an hour outside the City\u00a0of Atlanta, is located in\u00a0Cherokee County, a deeply red part of the state.\u00a0 A source close to the campaign told CNN that hosting the event in Canton was part of\u00a0Walker\u2019s runoff campaign\u00a0strategy\u00a0to perform better in Republican counties where they underperformed\u00a0on Election Day compared to incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who avoided a runoff.\u00a0 During his address to supporters, Walker continued to attack his rival, Sen. Raphael Warnock, and President Joe Biden, telling a crowd of supporters that the two are in lockstep. Walker went so far as to warn the crowd not to fall for Warnock\u2019s clean-cut\u00a0image, calling Warnock a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Cruz went on the offensive, enthusiastically addressing the crowd saying, \u201cI am here to tell you: On December 6th\u00a0Herschel Walker is winning this race.\u201c\u00a0\u00a0 Cruz\u00a0rallied\u00a0the\u00a0crowd with references\u00a0to\u00a0immigration, inflation and grievances against the media in his 15-minute\u00a0speech.\u00a0 He\u00a0boldly predicted the GOP would flip the Senate,\u00a0claiming that there is no bigger divide between a senator and his constituents than in Georgia, referring to Warnock.\u00a0 \u201cThe eyes of the country are upon you. The odds are high that control of the Senate will be decided by the men and women of Georgia,\u201c Cruz\u00a0said. When asked by CNN after the event if Cruz thought Walker should call on former President Donald Trump to visit Georgia to stump with Walker,\u00a0Cruz said:  \u201cHerschel has made clear he will welcome the support from President Trump who\u2019s supporting\u00a0him. He said he would welcome the support\u00a0of\u00a0Ron DeSantis. He will welcome the support of anyone coming to campaign.\"\u00a0 ##Georgia## Former Rep. Ryan Zinke, who left his seat for a scandal-plagued tenure as President Donald Trump\u2019s Interior secretary, will defeat Democrat Monica Tranel\u00a0to win Montana\u2019s 1st Congressional District, CNN projects. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and Montana state senator who was first elected to the House in 2014 and reelected in 2016 before resigning to join Trump\u2019s Cabinet, seized on an opening created when the 2020 census results handed the Treasure State a second congressional district. Republicans have 211 of the 218 seats needed to control the House, according to CNN projections. The Democrats have 195. With reporting from CNN\u2019s Paul LeBlanc Republican Rep. Young Kim, who was one of the first Korean American women elected to Congress, will win California's 40th Congressional District, according to CNN projections. Her victory, over Democrat Asif Mahmood, is a hold for the Republican Party.  House Democrats are eagerly awaiting word from Speaker Nancy Pelosi about whether she will continue to run the caucus she has dominated for the past two decades as they decide whether to run for the top job.  Pelosi is widely expected to announce her decision once it is clear which party will have the majority in the House and after she returns from her trip to a climate conference in Egypt. That could come as soon as next week when the House returns to session, with members meeting Monday evening for the first time since the election and the full caucus on Tuesday. The leadership elections are scheduled for Nov. 30. If she steps aside, as most members believe she will, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries is seen as the front-runner for the top position, though he could face a challenge from Rep. Adam Schiff and others. But all eyes are also on the two Democrats currently below Pelosi: Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn. Hoyer has long coveted the top position, but with many in the caucus calling for generational change and diversity in the ranks, the 83-year-old Hoyer could have a difficult time winning the votes. \"I've told all the younger members, I'll be out of here by 2036,\" Hoyer told reporters when asked about his next moves. He indicated he would wait for the House to be called before announcing his next steps. Clyburn has recently signaled he wouldn't block Jeffries' ascension to the top spot, but he might want to stay in leadership, which could prevent other Democrats from ascending. Rep. Katherine Clark is seen as the frontrunner for the No. 2 job, depending on what Hoyer and Clyburn do. Democratic candidates in the Arizona state-wide races extended their leads Thursday evening as a new batch of about 20,300 ballots was dropped by Pima County, which includes the city of Tucson.\u00a0 Elections Director Constance Hargrove told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer and John King the county has been able to report batches of approximately 20,000 ballots per day, and anticipated another ballot drop of 20,000 on Friday. \u201cWe will be working through the weekend and get through most of those ballots \u2014 not all of those ballots \u2014 probably by no later than Monday morning,\u201d Hargrove said.\u00a0 Responding to candidates, including Republican gubernatorial candidate Karl Lake, questioning the length and integrity of the vote counts, Hargrove said observers of both political parties watch Pima\u2019s count to ensure it is fair. \u201cWe always have at least two observers in the room at any time, and we\u2019ve had multiple observers of both parties here all week,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly won 66.2% of the vote in the latest batch, compared to Republican Blake Masters getting 31.9% of the vote. In the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Katie Hobbs received 64.8% of the vote, while Lake got 35.2% of the vote. Tucson is considered a more Democratic part of the state. ##Arizona## House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Fox News that President Joe Biden congratulated him when they spoke on the phone Wednesday.  \u201cIt was short. He just wanted to call me, congratulate from that point, talk about where we can work\u00a0together. Look, I said, I will work with anybody that wants to put American first and move us in the right direction,\u201d McCarthy said Thursday night.\n\u201cHe congratulated me, so for anyone who thinks we didn\u2019t win the majority, Joe at least believes we did as well,\u201d he said. \u00a0 CNN has not yet projected if the House will remain under Democrat control or flip to the Republicans \u2013 although the GOP appears to be inching its way toward a slim majority. On Thursday night, as he was leaving on a trip to Asia, Biden said he offered McCarthy congratulations \u201cif\u201d Republicans win the majority in the House, but said chances of Democrats holding the House are \u201cstill alive.\u201d\u00a0 \"I congratulated him. I said, \u2018If you win the majority, congratulations. But congratulations so far, you\u2019ve made some gains,\u2019\" Biden told CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond. McCarthy said that he used the conversation with Biden to lay out priorities for a Republican House majority, including energy independence and securing the border.  \u201cI laid this all out to the president and told him, \u2018I will work with you if you are willing to work on these items,\u2019\u201d he said.  McCarthy also dismissed speculation that he lacks enough support from the right wing of his caucus to become speaker.  \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cPeople can have input, we want to have a very open input process. We are going to have a smaller majority, so we\u2019re going to find that we work together.\u201d  On that possibility of a small majority, McCarthy quipped, \u201cThey don\u2019t give gavels out by small, medium and large, they just give you the gavel. We\u2019re going to be able to govern.\u201d  He argued that even if their numbers are smaller than projected, they met their goal.  \u201cWhat was our mission? To win the majority, to stop Biden\u2019s agenda, and fire Nancy Pelosi. All of that is accomplished.\u201d  Election officials in Maricopa County responded to false claims circulating online that Katie Hobbs \u2014 the sitting Arizona Secretary of State, who is also running for governor this year \u2013 had accessed a secure room with ballots at the vote-counting facility in Phoenix.\u00a0 A user on the far-right social media platform Gab posted a screenshot from the livestream of the count facility that showed a woman wearing glasses walking through the room. The user wrote, \u201cLook who was inside the ballot rooms. Katie Hobbs. Time stamped too.\u201d \"Not every woman with glasses is Katie Hobbs,\u201d the official Twitter account of Maricopa County\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in response Thursday evening. \"We can confirm this was a party Observer. Please refrain from making assumptions about workers who happen to wear glasses.\" The mischaracterized screenshot appears to have spread initially on the far-right social media platform Gab. Since then it has been shared thousands of times on Twitter and multiple versions of the image have been posted to Facebook.\u00a0 Maricopa, a county dogged by unfounded election conspiracy theories since 2020, streams live footage of its count center online, in an effort to increase transparency. \u00a0CNN reported earlier\u00a0this week how Maricopa has again become a hotbed of election conspiracy theories, many promoted by former President Donald Trump ##Arizona## In a race between two Democrats, Sydney Kamlager will defeat Jan Perry in California's 37th Congressional District, according to CNN projections.  This will be a hold for the Democratic Party. There are two other unprojected California House races in CA-15 and CA-34 between two Democrats. While CNN cannot yet project which candidate will win those seats, CNN is putting both in the Democratic column. CNN projects Democrats now have 195 of the 218 seats needed to control the House.. Bill Gates, the GOP chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, called out Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake for baselessly claiming that election officials were \u201cslow-rolling\u201d the release of election results. \u201cI feel 100% confident we are going to win this. I hate that they\u2019re slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable,\" Lake said Thursday on Charlie Kirk\u2019s right-wing talk show. \"They don\u2019t want to put out the truth, which is that we won.\u201d  There is no evidence that the election officials were tampering with results to make any candidate look good or bad. At a press conference Thursday, Gates responded to Lake\u2019s comments.  \u201cQuite frankly, it is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours,\u201d he said, referring to the election workers counting ballots nearby. \u201cI really hope this is the end of that now. We can be patient and respect the results when they come out.\u201d Gates said election workers in Maricopa County will continue working very long days through the weekend, including Friday which is a federal holiday, to deal with the strong vote-by-mail turnout seen in this election. On CNN later Thursday, Gates said: \"We're going to do it on a timeline, which is frankly consistent with what it takes, how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years. So there's nothing out of the ordinary -- it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past, in Maricopa County.\" Lake is a leading promoter of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and voting procedures in Arizona. ##Arizona## Former President Donald Trump is back to disparaging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. It comes after a brief hiatus, apparently prompted by complaints from top Republicans that he went too far in criticizing the governor just days before the midterm elections. On the heels of DeSantis' resounding reelection victory, which has intensified speculation that he will seek the GOP presidential nod in 2024, Trump issued a blistering statement Thursday. \"Ron DeSanctimonious is playing games!\" Trump wrote, repeating a nickname he coined for the governor. \"The Fake News asks him if he\u2019s going to run if President Trump runs, and he says, 'I\u2019m only focused on the Governor\u2019s race, I\u2019m not looking into the future.' Well, in terms of loyalty and class, that\u2019s really not the right answer.\" The former president also repeated his claim that his endorsement of DeSantis in the 2018 GOP primary for Florida governor, when the former congressman was widely considered a longshot, paved the way for DeSantis' meteoric rise in the Republican Party. \"Ron came to me in desperate shape in 2017,\" Trump said, likening his endorsement at the time to \"a nuclear weapon\" in the gubernatorial primary.\u00a0\"I also fixed his campaign, which had completely fallen apart.\"\u00a0 More background: Trump's comments come days after he first tested his \"DeSanctimonious\" nickname at a pre-midterm rally in Pennsylvania, drawing the ire of Republicans who wanted to avoid an early 2024 showdown between the two men, particularly as Republicans in tight midterm races were delivering their closing pitches to voters. The blowback caused the former president to tamp down his criticism of DeSantis at subsequent rallies in Miami and Ohio. Though DeSantis was notably absent from Trump's Florida rally with Sen. Marco Rubio last Sunday, Trump encouraged the crowd at one point to reelect their Republican governor. DeSantis won his reelection contest against Democrat Charlie Crist by a 19-point margin Tuesday. He did not seek Trump's endorsement and has consistently declined to weigh in on speculation about his presidential ambitions. This midterm election results were a \"clear victory for team normal,\" Republican Rep. Liz Cheney said Thursday while speaking at the\u00a0Anti-Defamation League's Never Is Now Summit on Antisemitism and Hate. \"I think that it was a clear victory for team normal,\u00a0and we have a huge amount of work to do,\" Cheney said, adding that the election showed \"a real rejection of the toxicity and the hate, and vitriol and of Donald Trump.\" Cheney also spoke about crossing party lines and campaigning for Democrats this election.\u00a0Cheney, who represents Wyoming, lost her primary election in August. \"And I think that for me, as well as for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, there's just been a real recognition of we don't minimize our policy disagreements,\" Cheney said. \"We absolutely have policy disagreements, but we recognize that there's something much bigger and more at stake and that we have to come together and stand for fundamental democratic principles, stand for the rule of law.\" Cheney said that defeating anti-democratic forces will require \"a level of bipartisanship that you might not have seen otherwise.\" Speaking on the\u00a0rise in antisemitism hate speech and hate crimes, she said \"we know from history\" that it cannot be tolerated. \"I do think it was the American people generally sending a message they want to pull us back from the brink. They don't want this nation to go, you know, over the edge to go into the abyss and we have to make sure that you know, the incentives are there to elect the kind of people who are going to make sure that they're part of the solution,\" Cheney said. Some context: Cheney is leaving Congress at the end of her current term after\u00a0losing the Republican primary\u00a0for her at-large Wyoming seat in August. Her continued criticism of Trump\u00a0for his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was seen as a key factor in her defeat. Cheney said last month that she\u00a0would not remain a Republican\u00a0if Trump is the GOP nominee for president in 2024. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, is teaming up with Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to fund a get-out-the-vote operation to help push Herschel Walker in the Dec. 6 runoff, according to a spokesperson for the super PAC.  It's a sign of how all factions of the GOP are uniting behind a race that could determine the balance of power in the Senate. The committee is dropping $2 million to bankroll the turnout operation that Kemp build, according to the spokesperson Jack Pandol, who confirmed a Politico story that said there would be more than 100 field workers as part of the effort. Some context: With the Georgia runoff campaign already underway, money is pouring into the state as the parties and interest groups seek to shape its outcome.\u00a0 On the other side, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a $7 million field organizing investment to boost Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\u00a0 ##Georgia## Election officials in Arizona are still counting ballots as several key races are too close to call. CNN estimates that about 675,000 votes still remain to be counted in the state. Maricopa County, the most populous county, has about 400,000 votes left to count and Pima County also has about 160,000 ballots left. The results from thousands of more ballots will be released between 10 and 11 p.m. ET Thursday, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Gates said at a news conference. Officials there tell CNN that they expect that drop to include ballots from\u00a0Saturday night, Sunday and most of Monday.  The ballots will be \"more than the 62,000\" that were released Wednesday night, \"but not significantly more.\" Some context: Gates told CNN earlier Thursday that a large percentage of the ballots left to count include votes that were dropped off on Election Day. In Arizona, mail-in ballots that were dropped off right before and on Tuesday don\u2019t even start the important process of signature verification until the Wednesday after Election Day Watch Maricopa County official give an update: \u00a0##Arizona## House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is taking initial steps to show House Republicans he won't lead as a top-down speaker dictating his demands to the rank-and-file, a hallmark of speakers' past but one that would lead to a revolt internally. CNN\u00a0is yet to project\u00a0which party will win the House as several key races are too early to call, but Republicans appear to be moving toward a slim majority, and McCarthy has already started jockeying for support. Today, he set up working groups to help develop a GOP agenda and investigative priorities. His allies say the moves are intended to show he will listen to his colleagues. And in his private pitches to members, he is trying to convince them that his way of leading was successful in bringing the GOP back to the majority over two election cycles. Yet members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus spent the day behind closed doors strategizing about how to empower their faction in what is expected to be a narrow GOP majority. They are asking for McCarthy to commit to a series of rule changes, including making it easier to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker \u2014 an idea that McCarthy has flatly rejected. But Lauren Boebert and other members of the Freedom Caucus call that a \"red line.\" McCarthy reached out to another Freedom Caucus member, Ralph Norman, who on Thursday wouldn't commit to supporting him. Norman indicated McCarthy seemed open to meeting with them as a group. Some members of the Freedom Caucus are threatening to put up a challenge against McCarthy in next week's leadership elections \u2014 even if it's a long-shot bid. Next week, the House GOP will vote on nominating McCarthy as speaker. He only needs a majority of his conference's support to win that nomination. But he will need 218 votes of the full House to become speaker in January, and GOP defections in a narrow majority could complicate that effort. Members of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus are withholding their support for House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s speakership bid and have begun to lay out their list of demands, which includes rule changes and stronger commitments on investigations into the Biden administration.\u00a0 Although many races are still too early to call, the Republican Party is inching toward gaining a slim majority in the House. GOP Rep. Chip Roy told reporters he wants McCarthy to list in greater detail his plans for a wide array of investigations, while Rep. Andy Biggs complained that McCarthy seemed to backpedal on whether he\u2019d be willing to launch impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his cabinet. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from multiple of my constituents who question the wisdom of proceeding forward with that leadership,\u201d Biggs said, adding that there needs be a \u201cfrank conversation\u201d about who they elect for the top job.\u00a0 Members of the group, who huddled all day Thursday for their new member orientation, are also pushing to make it easier for lawmakers to call for floor votes on ousting a sitting speaker. That is something that McCarthy is adamantly against and was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he eventually resigned.\u00a0 Rep. Lauren Boebert said it was a \u201cred line\u201d for her. But not everyone in the Freedom Caucus is united on whether to make that a hard line.\u00a0 Rep. Ralph Norman said McCarthy personally called and asked for his support for speaker, but Norman wouldn\u2019t commit. He told McCarthy there\u2019s a group of them that wants to meet, which he said McCarthy was amenable to, but so far the GOP leader hasn\u2019t caved into their demands.\u00a0 Norman said the group hopes to formalize a lengthier list of all the rules changes they are seeking. They are also pushing to delay next week\u2019s internal leadership elections, though there is no indication McCarthy plans to do so. \u201cI'm not supporting anybody until I know what the blueprint is,\u201d Norman said.\u00a0 When asked whether McCarthy should get credit for delivering the majority, Norman responded: \u201cThe taxpayers that voted the representatives in deserve the credit.\u201d Pima County will report a new batch of around 10,000 votes to the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s office around 8 p.m. ET, county elections officials said Thursday.\u00a0 As of Thursday, about 52,692 ballots had been processed by Pima County recorder Gabriella C\u00e1zares-Kelly\u2019s office and sent to Pima County elections director Constance Hargrove. C\u00e1zares-Kelly said her office has another approximately 53,773 ballots awaiting processing, which will be sent to the elections office and reported to the state in the coming days.\u00a0 Responding to criticism from some campaigns that vote counting is taking too long, C\u00e1zares-Kelly said local officials were on a schedule in line with past elections and suggested counting could be done by Monday.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLooking at our numbers, we\u2019re going to be finished up pretty soon,\u201d she said. \u201cMonday is a really good goal. We\u2019ve been able to transfer over 52,000 ballots over to the election department; that\u2019s kind of phenomenal.\u201d She added there are about 1,000 ballots that need additional information like signature verification from voters who dropped them off. The county has contacted voters with these ballots, and the public has until Nov. 16 to cure their ballots, C\u00e1zares-Kelly said.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can, recognizing how eager the public is to hear from our offices,\u201d she added.\u00a0 ##Arizona## Retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey was sharply critical of Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano on Thursday, blaming him for dragging down the candidacy of Mehmet Oz in the race to replace Toomey in the Senate. The outgoing senator made the remarks in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett. Toomey started by saying that he thought Oz \"ran a very good campaign.\" \"So the question that I think\u00a0arises is, 'Why did a good\u00a0candidate, running a good race, in\u00a0what should be a very good\u00a0environment, not prevail in a\u00a0state like Pennsylvania \u2014 which\u00a0is very, very competitive?\"\u00a0Toomey said. \"I think a big part of the\u00a0reason was that at the top of\u00a0the ticket, in the gubernatorial\u00a0race, we had an ultra-MAGA\u00a0candidate who never appeared to\u00a0even attempt to expand beyond a\u00a0hardcore base that was very,\u00a0very committed to him.\u00a0But he ended up losing in an epic beatdown.\" Toomey said it's \"very, very hard\" for a Republican down-ballot to win with someone so unpopular at the top of the ticket. He pointed out that Oz's loss to Democrat John Fetterman was relatively narrow when compared with Mastriano's margin against Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro. Toomey, who has been sharply critical of former President Donald Trump and the Republican party's shift under his leadership, blamed the former president for involving himself in the selection of candidates across the country. \"This is a huge problem, and I think my party needs to face the fact that if fealty to Donald Trump is the primary\u00a0criteria for selecting\u00a0candidates, we're probably not\u00a0going to do really well,\" he told Burnett. Some background: The Trump-endorsed Mastriano came to national attention for his vehement election denialism and his presence in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. As the election went on, he did little to hedge his far-right positions or reach out to groups beyond his base of supporters, CNN's Chris Cillizza wrote. Oz, meanwhile, focused on bringing \u201cbalance\u201d to the Senate in the final days of the race \u2013 casting himself a moderate voice who could navigate between extremes within the two parties. As of Thursday evening, CNN\u00a0is yet to project\u00a0which party will win the House and the Senate as several key races are too early to call \u2014 some of that is because of the election processes in many West Coast states. The two Senate races for which there is no projection are in Arizona and Nevada. There is no winner in Georgia's Senate race, but CNN has projected it will proceed to a runoff in December. Here's a look at the 34 House races that still have not been projected: California: 16\nArizona: 3\nNevada: 3\nOregon: 2\nWashington: 2\nColorado: 2\nMontana: 1\nNew Mexico: 1 Two additional outstanding House races are in Alaska and Maine, where determining the winner in a ranked-choice voting system takes longer. Plus, there's one remaining House race in both New York and Maryland.\u00a0 The benefit of knowing who won on Election Day is arguably outweighed by allowing more people access to the vote and the cost savings of not having to staff so many polling places. In Arizona, mail-in ballots that were dropped off right before and on Tuesday don\u2019t even start the important process of signature verification until the Wednesday after Election Day, according to Bill Gates, the chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. \u201cWe have experts here who go through, compare the signature on the outside of the ballot envelope with the signature that we have in our voter registration file,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThat takes a while because we got to get that right.\u201d Most states have some sort of signature verification system for their absentee and mail-in ballots, according to\u00a0a tally\u00a0from the National Conference of State Legislatures. While Arizona still has a lot of in-person voting on Election Day, other states have moved to an entirely vote-by-mail system, like California. The West Coast has been taking a long time to count these votes for years, but the process is getting added scrutiny this year because those unprojected races will determine who controls the chambers of Congress. Nevada also transitioned to an all-mail-in system in 2022. That means ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday can be received by election officials until Saturday and still be counted. It\u2019s not actually known how many ballots will trickle in because every registered voter in Nevada was mailed a ballot. Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, who is locked in an extremely tight reelection race, suggested that a lack of voter enthusiasm for her party's candidates for governor and Senate caused her race to be much closer than anticipated. She noted that the Democratic governor, Jared Polis, and incumbent Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, both skated to reelection.\u00a0 \"I think Polis and Bennet definitely carried the ticket for the Democrat Party,\" she told CNN.\u00a0 CNN projects Bennet beat Republican Joe O'Dea, the CEO of a construction company, by winning more than 54% of the vote while Polis defeated Republican Heidi Ganahl by gaining more than 57% of the ballots. Boebert added, \"I don't know if there wasn't enough enthusiasm for our top ticket candidates for governor and Senate or what happened there. But there was a lot of shifting of the votes there.\" With 98% of the vote counted, Boebert holds a 794-vote lead over Democrat Adam Frisch in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District. Boebert still expressed confidence she would eke out a victory. \"Of course, I expect to win.\" But Republicans say she didn't do enough to insulate herself from backlash from voters in her district. Indeed, a GOP source says she was advised to spend more of her campaign cash late in the cycle.\u00a0 Asked if she believes Republican leaders gave her enough support, Boebert said: \"I am my support.\" GOP Rep. Scott Perry, who chairs the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, said members are looking for a speaker who is \"interested in more fairness for members and a more member-driven conference, as opposed to a leadership-driven, top-down strategy.\"\u00a0 Asked by CNN if this included House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, he said, \"yes, of course.\"  However, he also told reporters that he tried to call McCarthy yesterday and \"didn't get an opportunity to talk with him.\"\u00a0 \"When I'm running for office, and I've done that, I go out and I see my potential constituents and, you know, I try and earn their vote,\" he said. \"And I think that anybody that's running for any office ought to, that's the position. And I'm not trying to be disrespectful or pejorative, but that's \u2014 you earn the vote, you earn it.\" Later Thursday night, the group will hear from Fox News Host Tucker Carlson, who is the keynote speaker at its dinner reception. Some context: Although many races are still too early to call, the Republican Party is inching toward gaining a slim majority in the House \u2013 and McCarthy, the House GOP Leader, has been moving swiftly to lock down the votes to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel, according to multiple GOP sources. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the progressive Democrat whose office prosecuted George Floyd\u2019s killer, will overcome a tough challenge to win a second term, CNN projects. \u00a0 Ellison will defeat Republican Jim Schultz, who characterized him as extreme in a race that focused largely on police reform efforts in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing. \u00a0 Looming over the contest was the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. \u00a0 Ellison\u2019s office successfully prosecuted Floyd\u2019s killer, Derek Chauvin. But the killing and protests over racial injustice in its aftermath touched off a debate over policing that reverberated in this year\u2019s midterm elections. \u00a0 Last year, Ellison was among the progressive supporters of a ballot measure in Minneapolis that would have replaced the city\u2019s police department with a new Department of Public Safety \u2014 in the process, eliminating a requirement that the city have a minimum number of police officers tied to its population and shifting its oversight from the mayor and police chief to the city council. \u00a0 But in November 2021, Minneapolis voters rejected that measure, dealing a blow to police reform efforts nationwide. \u00a0 Schultz, who was endorsed by Minnesota\u2019s largest police union, had lambasted Ellison over rising crime rates in the state and accused him of advancing anti-police ideology. \u00a0 He blamed Ellison and other Democratic leaders for their response to property damage and crime during the summer 2020 protests over Floyd\u2019s killing. \u00a0 Ellison, meanwhile, sought to shift the race\u2019s focus to abortion rights. He and his supporters pointed to Schultz\u2019s former role on the board of a conservative anti-abortion group. The Democratic attorney general has also said he would fight against other states\u2019 laws that impose criminal penalties on those who travel for abortions to states\u2014 like Minnesota \u2014where the procedure is legal.\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado has announced he is running for the position of Democratic Caucus Chair. Neguse currently serves as the\u00a0co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\u00a0 The current chair of the Democratic caucus, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, is term limited in his position.\u00a0 \u201cAs votes across the country continue to be counted, it is clear that the stakes of the 118th Congress could not be higher. With our country at a crossroads, it will be more important than ever for the House Democratic Caucus to be unified and singularly focused.\u00a0It is with that in mind that I respectfully request your support of my candidacy for Chair of the House Democratic Caucus,\u201d Neguse wrote to his colleagues. Democrats are holding their leadership elections Nov. 30, even though the current Democratic leadership, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn has not announced publicly and definitively if they intend to run again. CNN is yet to project which party will win the House.  Punchbowl News was first to report.\u00a0 Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said on Thursday he feels \u201cgreat\u201d about the election outcome so far, compared to how he felt last week going into the midterms. And with three key US Senate seats still undecided, he said he likes Democrats\u2019 odds. \u201cCompared to how I felt last weekend, I feel great,\u201d he told reporters at the US Capitol. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve got three undecided seats still to be counted but I like our odds better than the other folks \u2026 the fact that it's two days after the election and we don\u2019t know who is the majority in the House is remarkable.\u201d Asked what he would attribute the election results to, Warner said he believes a lot of it came down to democracy.\u00a0 \u201cYou can argue the Democrats\u2019\u00a0message wasn't perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a lot better than the media thought it was. And the one thing that's absolutely clear was that for a lot of the Republican messaging,\u00a0which was all about relitigating a 2020 election or denying the validity of our democracy, that is not what the American people wanted to hear. So, I think that is probably bigger than any other item.\u201d He continued to say he thinks some of the extreme viewpoints being embraced by some candidates made voters \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI think that views that are so far out of the mainstream that either political party 10 years ago, eight years ago, they would have been viewed as ludicrous had an effect that one of the two political parties in had a lot of candidates that embraced from election denial to QAnon to, you know, re-litigation of the 2020 presidential election I think make folks uncomfortable,\u201d he said. On how the midterm election poised President Biden for reelection, Warner said Biden\u2019s coming out \u201cstronger.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s obviously coming out of this midterm stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cHe seemed like, with the little bit I saw yesterday, he was having a good time with the press corp. If you can do that in these kinds of jobs, that\u2019s a good place to be.\u201d New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says the informal group of Democratic House progressives known as \"The Squad\u201d is adding two new members: Reps.-elect Summer Lee of Pennsylvania and Greg Casar of Texas. Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday shared on her\u00a0Instagram story\u00a0a post that read, \u201cAll 6 members of \u2018The Squad\u2019 win re-election during 2022 midterms.\u201d She then wrote, \u201cAnd we added at least two more,\u201d tagging the accounts of Lee and Casar, who will be representing Pennsylvania\u2019s 12th and Texas\u2019 35th congressional districts, respectively. She also extended an invitation to \u201canyone else who wants to join too.\u201d \"The Squad\u201d first drew attention following the 2018 election, after Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0posted a photo\u00a0of herself with other incoming freshman lawmakers Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, with the term as a caption. The group expanded to include Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, after they were elected in 2020. The\u00a0latest results coming out of Yavapai County, Arizona, are comprised entirely of early ballots. According to Chief Deputy Recorder Karen McKracken, these early ballots are a combination of drop boxes, vote centers on Election Night and the mail. The county has about 9,900 early ballots remaining to process: About 1,500 from the mail\nAbout 3,500 that were handed over at in-person polling places\nAbout 6,300 that were put into drop boxes on Election Day\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, so far, Yavapai has tabulated 105,734 ballots. There are 608 provisional ballots that they are verifying right now. Officials said they hope to be done verifying tomorrow so they can begin tabulation.  They don\u2019t know when the tabulation will be complete, as they are beginning a hand count on Saturday that will be an all-hands-on-deck effort. ##Arizona## Foreign\u00a0operatives\u00a0could\u00a0use the days and week between\u00a0Election\u00a0Day and when votes\u00a0are\u00a0certified\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including\u00a0the lead-up to a contentious\u00a0Senate\u00a0runoff\u00a0in Georgia \u2014\u00a0to further amplify disinformation about voting and sow discord among Americans, a top\u00a0US\u00a0cybersecurity\u00a0official\u00a0said Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m worried a lot about\u00a0foreign\u00a0adversaries taking advantage of the murkiness between actual\u00a0Election\u00a0Day and final certification to sow chaos,\u201d Jen Easterly, the head of\u00a0US\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told reporters at conference in Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0 The Georgia\u00a0runoff\u00a0between Republican Herschel Walker and Democrat Raphael Warnock will occur Dec. 6 after neither reached a 50% threshold needed for victory.\u00a0 There were only handful of documented\u00a0cyberattacks aimed at\u00a0election-related infrastructure on\u00a0Election\u00a0Day, but nothing that kept people from casting their vote, according to\u00a0US\u00a0officials. But\u00a0foreign\u00a0influence activity \u2014 the\u00a0use of social media or other means to sway voters \u2014\u00a0is harder to measure. US\u00a0officials\u00a0are\u00a0particularly concerned about any\u00a0foreign\u00a0efforts to amplify disinformation and any violent online rhetoric in Georgia and Arizona, where vote tallies\u00a0are\u00a0still coming in. Asked about\u00a0foreign\u00a0influence operations on\u00a0Election\u00a0Day, Easterly said \u201cthere was\u00a0nothing that came in that caught my attention in a significant way.\u201d\u00a0 Russian state media made an eleventh-hour push to cast baseless doubts on the integrity of\u00a0US\u00a0elections with multiple misleading or false articles about the midterms in the last 24 hours, according to independent research and a CNN review of Russian media.\u00a0 The propaganda blitz came after Kremlin-linked oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0said\u00a0that Russia has\u00a0interfered, is interfering and will continue to interfere in the\u00a0US\u00a0democratic process.\u00a0 There are more than 50,000 ballots that need to be counted in Clark County, Nevada, which are in \u201cvarious stages in the process of validation,\u201d county registrar Joe Gloria said in a Thursday update.  Clark County is home to Las Vegas, is the most populous county in the state, and contains the bulk of the statewide electorate. \u201cOf all the ballots that we received, whether it was the US Postal (Service) pickup yesterday or the mail ballot dropoffs that we pulled from all the boxes for Election Day, we currently have approximately 50,000 ballots that still need to be counted,\u201d Gloria said.\u00a0\u00a0 A day earlier, Gloria said county officials received more than 12,700 ballots from the USPS on Wednesday and collected roughly 56,900 mail ballots from Election Day drop boxes.\u00a0 On Thursday, election officials received another 626 ballots from the postal service, Gloria said. The county will continue to receive ballots from the postal service through Saturday, as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 8.\u00a0 Election officials will continue \u201ccuring\u201d mail ballots through Monday. \u201cCuring\u201d is when election officials contact voters to fix mistakes on their ballots, like if information is missing.  On Thursday, Gloria said there were more than 7,100 that have not been \u201ccured.\u201d There are also roughly 5,555 provisional ballots from in-person Election Day voting in Clark County, Gloria has said. Officials won\u2019t be able to count those ballots until next week. Gloria expects the majority of the county\u2019s ballots to be reported on by Saturday, with the exception of ballots that need to be cured and provisional ballots. \u201cPeople have been processing ballots here in Clark County for about 18 days. We\u2019re working all of the hours that we can work,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t move any faster than what the law currently allows us to do.\u201d Clark County officials told CNN's Gary Tuchman that they do expect a large update in vote totals tonight. They did not provide a time for the update, however.\u00a0 What is at stake in Nevada: A crucial Senate race between Republican nominee Adam Laxalt and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has not been called. The contest could help determine which party controls the Senate. ##Nevada## Maricopa County \u2014 the most populous county in Arizona \u2014 said it will release more election results at 10 p.m. ET tonight.\u00a0 County officials are holding a news conference at 6 p,m. ET, but results are not expected to be released then. Why is the vote count taking so long? The biggest reason for the delay is the way that each state handles the ballots outside of those cast at polling places on Election Day, including both early votes and mail-in ballots. In\u00a0Arizona, there are still roughly 600,000 ballots to be counted. The majority of those, about 400,000 ballots, are in Maricopa County.  Of those ballots, about 290,000 were dropped off at vote centers on Election Day, Bill Gates, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman, said on CNN Thursday. Those ballots have to be processed before they can be counted, leading to a lag time in tabulating. In addition, Maricopa County has about 17,000 ballots that were attempted to be counted on Election Day but were not read by the tabulator because of a printer error, and those ballots still need to be counted, too. Why Arizona is key: The race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters \u2014 one of the contests that could help determine which party controls the Senate \u2014 is yet to be called in the state.  ##Arizona## As Clark County, Nevada, continued to count votes on Thursday, the county registrar rejected former President Donald Trump\u2019s latest effort to raise suspicions about its elections \u2014 saying Trump is obviously \u201cmisinformed.\u201d Trump\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0on his social media platform on Thursday that Clark County \u201chas a corrupt voting system,\u201d warning Republican Senate candidate Adam Laxalt to \u201cbe careful.\u201d There is simply no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. And the claim followed Trump\u2019s numerous false allegations about the 2020 election in\u00a0Clark County, a Democratic stronghold that is home to Las Vegas. On Thursday, Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria told reporters: \u201cObviously he\u2019s misinformed, two years later, about the law and our election processes which ensure the integrity of elections in Clark County and the state.\u201d Gloria explained that state law requires counties to receive mail-in ballots until Saturday (if they were postmarked by Election Day) and gives voters until Monday to fix issues with their signatures. He also noted that the county isn\u2019t yet allowed to process provisional ballots. \u201cMy staff has been working very diligently, we\u2019ve been here from early in the morning until late at night, we\u2019ve been fully staffed, we\u2019re working as hard as we possibly can in order to get the ballots counted,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cBut whether we like it or not, there\u2019s no way that we can move any faster than we\u2019re currently moving.\u201d Nevada has\u00a0tight races\u00a0for the US Senate, governor and other offices. ##Nevada## In remarks Thursday at a DNC event, President Joe Biden reiterated that Election Day was a \"good day for America\" and \"a strong night for Democrats.\" \u201cTuesday was a good day for America, a good day for democracy. And it was a strong night for Democrats,\u201d Biden said, speaking to a room of DNC campaign workers and volunteers in Washington, DC. He thanked them for believing in the country and for fighting to make sure there was a \u201cfree and fair election.\" CNN is yet to project which party will win the House and the Senate as several key races are too early to call.  The president noted polls predicting big losses for his party before the election, saying, \u201cfolks that didn\u2019t happen,\" touting the success of Democrats holding on to House seats and winning governorships across the country. \u201cWe did beat the odds,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt was the first national election since Jan. 6 and there were a lot of concerns about if democracy would meet the test \u2014 it did, it did, it did,\" he said referring to the 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. The future of democracy itself was a common message for Biden on the campaign trail ahead of Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was also speaking at the event, echoed the president's message, saying \"as we gather here votes are still being counted, but it is clear your work sent a message to the entire world: democracy is intact.\" She said some Democrats and some Republicans won and \u201cthat\u2019s what happens\u201d when millions of people vote in \u201cfree and fair elections\u201d The vice president said voters across our country knew what they stood for, so they knew what to fight for, pointing to states where voters approved ballot measures aimed at protecting abortion. Harris argued that people do not need to abandon their beliefs to agree that \u201cthe government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\u201d she said. \u201cThis president understands democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,\u201d Harris said, adding that what they saw this week is that \u201cwhen we fight, we win.\u201d Coconino\u00a0County, Arizona, has about 14,896 ballots left to process and count, county recorder Patty Hansen told CNN Thursday.\u00a0Coconino\u00a0is in the north-central part of Arizona. Here's how that breaks down: Early ballots left to process: 12,630\nProvisional ballots left to process: 1,000\nBallots that have been processed and are ready for tabulation: 1,266 Why Arizona is key: The race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly an Republican nominee Blake Masters \u2014 which could help determine the balance of the Senate \u2014 is yet to be called in Arizona. It is also too early to call the gubernatorial race between Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake. ##Arizona## Rep. Bob Good, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told reporters that House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy \u201chas not done anything to earn my vote\u201d for speaker. The Virginia Republican also predicted that \u201cthere will be a challenge to (McCarthy) as a speaker candidate,\u201d a possibility that CNN first reported was under consideration by the group. Such a challenge would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. It would be an attempt to show McCarthy during next week\u2019s internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn\u2019t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told reporters that \u201cno one currently has 218\u201d votes for speaker, which is the magic number McCarthy would need to secure the speaker\u2019s gavel on the House floor in January. The House Freedom Caucus has been meeting all day for its new member orientation, where their strategy in the leadership fight has come up, according to a source familiar with the conversations. McCarthy has spent the last two days working the phones and has been hearing out potential holdouts and critics, but so far not making promises or caving into their hardline demands, sources said. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger picked his own race as the focus of a required statewide audit for 2022 election results. Raffensperger, a Republican\u00a0who refused former President Donald Trump's\u00a0request to \"find\" votes\u00a0needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State,\u00a0defeated the Democratic nominee this week. A Georgia law passed in 2019 requires the secretary of state to choose one race every two years to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results.\u00a0 Georgia election officials estimate that 5 to 7%\u00a0of ballots from the secretary of state race will be recounted for the audit. They say the results will prove \u201cstatistical confidence\u201d that the election's outcome is correct.\u00a0\u00a0 How the audit works: Georgia\u2019s 159 counties will be required to conduct a hand recount of a batch of results from the race. On Nov. 16, election officials will roll a twenty-sided dice to determine which random batches of ballots will be counted and then each county election office will start their hand-counting on Nov. 17. They are expected to share the results by the following day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blake Evans, the elections director with the secretary of state's office, will spearhead the audit. \u201cI think it's a very honorable thing for the secretary to choose his own contest, because we have a high degree of confidence in it,\u201d Evans said during a Thursday press conference. \u201cWe want folks to know that we are trustworthy.\u201d State leaders said they also chose the race to try to ease the burden on busy county election workers: The large margin of victory for Raffensperger makes the audit easier to conduct. That's important, given the impending Senate runoff that will keep them busy. Raffensperger\u2019s only function in the audit is to select the race which will be examined, according to his office. ##Georgia## Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock kicked off his runoff campaign against Republican Herschel Walker on Thursday in Atlanta, arguing his second runoff Senate election in as many years is about \u201ccompetence and character.\u201d Remember: CNN projected on Wednesday that the hotly contested Senate contest in\u00a0Georgia\u00a0will advance to a runoff between Warnock and Walker on Dec. 6. Depending on how Senate races in Arizona and Nevada are decided, the race could be determinative in control of the currently evenly divided Senate. \u201cI came really to ask you one question: Are you ready to do this one more time,\u201d Warnock said to cheers, a nod to the successful runoff election he ran against Republican Kelly Loeffler in 2020. \u201cLet\u2019s get it done.\u201d  Warnock looked to avoid this scenario in the final weeks of the campaign, running ads warning Georgians that all the attack ads they have seen for months would continue through Thanksgiving if the state had a runoff. \u201cNow, you have to admit that I did warn you all that we might be spending Thanksgiving together,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cAnd here we are. So, I am going to need you to stick with me for four more weeks. Can we do that? Because we\u2019ve got some unfinished business.\u201d  Warnock only glancingly acknowledged the potential national ramifications of the race -- \u201cI need you to fight like the future of Georgia and the future of America depends on it, because it does,\u201d he said -- and instead used his speech to speak directly to the Georgians who didn\u2019t vote for him on Tuesday night. \u201cFor those of you who made a different choice this time, whether for Herschel Walker or someone else, I want to speak directly to you: Over the next four weeks, I hope you will give me the opportunity to earn your vote,\u201d the Democratic senator said. \u201cEvery day I have served in the Senate, I have been thinking about the people of Georgia and that is what I will do the next six years.\u201d  ##Georgia## Arizona's Maricopa County has not started counting 290,000 ballots that were dropped off at voting sites on election day \u2014 a critical batch of ballots that could help determine who wins the uncalled Senate and governor\u2019s races in the state, Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors, told CNN Thursday. Maricopa County has about 400,000 ballots left to count, and 290,000 of those are early ballots that were dropped off at voting sites Tuesday,\u00a0Gates told CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner. The 290,000 ballots that were dropped off on election day \u201cwas a record,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said. About 70% more people chose to vote by dropping off their early ballots on election day than they have at any point in the past, breaking the previous record, Gates said.\u00a0 Those ballots must have signature verification review before they can be counted\u00a0he told CNN. \u201cIf you drop off an early ballot, it means it has to come in on Wednesday and start the process of being signature verified,\u201d Gates said, which is a process that takes longer than voting in person on election day and having your vote counted through the tabulator immediately. \u201cWe have experts here who go through, compare the signature on the outside of the ballot envelope with the signature that we have in our voter registration file, so that takes a while, cause we gotta get that right,\u201d Gates said. Maricopa County had \u201cbig voter turnout\u201d throughout the whole election, with about 230,000 people voting in person on election day, in addition to the ballots that were dropped off, Bill Gates, Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said.\u00a0 ##Arizona## House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is moving swiftly to lock down the votes to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel as a hard-right faction of his conference discusses whether to mount a long-shot challenge to complicate his bid and force concessions in the process, according to multiple GOP sources. McCarthy privately spoke to his closest advisers and confidantes in a Wednesday morning phone call just hours after his party appeared on track to take the House\u00a0but fell short of their bullish expectations\u00a0of a massive GOP landslide. The California Republican tapped a group of members to be on his whip team that will help him secure the 218 votes in order to win the speakership in January, with GOP lawmakers on the call promising to \u201cwork hard to get him elected,\u201d according to a source familiar with the matter. And several allies were seen popping in and out of McCarthy\u2019s office on Wednesday as they started to hash out and execute their game plan. \u201cYes,\u201d McCarthy said confidently Wednesday night as he left the Capitol and was asked if he had the votes to assume the speakership. A source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus\u2019 deliberations told CNN on Wednesday morning that there are around two dozen current and incoming members who are willing to vote against McCarthy if he doesn\u2019t offer them concessions. They are actively discussing putting up a nominal challenger to face McCarthy in next week\u2019s leadership elections in an effort to force the GOP leader to give them more influence in how the House operates, the source said. McCarthy, who sent a letter to the conference Wednesday afternoon officially declaring his bid for the speakership and asking members for their support, spoke with some potential GOP holdouts behind closed doors throughout the day, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial conservative who\u00a0was booted\u00a0from her committee assignments by Democrats \u2013 and a number of Republicans \u2013 over her past incendiary rhetoric. Greene has pushed for a spot on the powerful House Oversight Committee in a GOP majority. Leaving McCarthy\u2019s office, Greene would not say if she\u2019d get what she\u2019s been seeking. Next week\u2019s leadership election is just the first step in the process. McCarthy would need to win a majority of his conference\u2019s support next week to be nominated for speaker before a January vote when he would need 218 votes of the full House to win the gavel. Key races\u00a0to determine control of the Senate in\u00a0Arizona\u00a0and\u00a0Nevada\u00a0have yet to be called as both states race to count hundreds of thousands of ballots that have yet to be processed. It still may be hours \u2013 or days \u2013 before enough\u00a0ballots are counted\u00a0in those states to determine who won the Senate. There are also many\u00a0uncalled congressional races that will determine what the House looks like when the new Congress is seated. The unofficial results \u2013 and lingering uncertainty about who will control Congress next year \u2013 hasn\u2019t prevented Republican apprehension about the election results, where an expected Republican wave never materialized.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what you should know as the counting continues: Where things stand in Arizona and Nevada \u2014 and why it's taking so long to count ballots: The biggest reason for the delay is the way that each state handles the ballots outside of those cast at polling places on Election Day, including both early votes and mail-in ballots. In\u00a0Arizona, for instance, there are still roughly 600,000 ballots to be counted. The majority of those, about 400,000 ballots, are in Maricopa County, the state\u2019s most populous county that includes Phoenix.  Of those ballots, about 290,000 were dropped off at vote centers on Election Day, Bill Gates, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman, said on CNN Thursday. Those ballots have to be processed before they can be counted, leading to a lag time in tabulating. In addition, the county has about 17,000 ballots that were attempted to be counted on Election Day but were not read by the tabulator because of a printer error, and those ballots still need to be counted, too. In Nevada, state law allows mail-in ballots to be received through Saturday, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day. That means counties are still receiving ballots to be counted. Clark County, the state\u2019s largest that includes Las Vegas, received more than 12,000 postmarked ballots from the post office on Wednesday, Clark County registrar Joe Gloria said. In addition, counties in Nevada have tens of thousands of mail-in ballots that were dropped off on Election Day in drop boxes located at polling places. Clark County said that its Election Day drop boxes contained nearly 57,000 mail ballots. Trump vs. DeSantis: The lackluster performance of several candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump has cast new doubts on his expected 2024 campaign. At the same time, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 resounding reelection victory is fueling calls for\u00a0him to capitalize on his momentum\u00a0and challenge Trump for the 2024 nomination. The Trump-DeSantis showdown has been simmering for months now, but it could burst into the open as the primary season officially gets underway. After \"red wave\" washes out, McCarthy faces tougher path: Republicans are still closing in on a majority in the House, even after Democrats had a better-than-expected night Tuesday. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is moving swiftly to lock down votes needed to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel in the next Congress. CNN has not yet projected a Republican takeover of the chamber. But the ultimate size of a Republican majority could determine how difficult it will be for McCarty to become speaker, as a narrow majority could prompt the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus to stand in the way of McCarthy\u2019s leadership ambitions. A source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus\u2019 deliberations told CNN on Wednesday morning there are around two dozen current and incoming members willing to vote against McCarthy if he doesn\u2019t offer them concessions. CNN\u2019s Ellie Kaufmann, Bob Ortega, Gary Tuchman, Paul Vercammen, Kristen Holmes, Gabby Orr, Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report. ##Catch Up## White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN that President Biden will do \u201cwhatever is helpful\u201d to assist Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock as his midterm race is projected to head to a runoff against Republican Hershel Walker this December.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe president will do whatever is helpful to Sen. Warnock, whether that\u2019s campaigning with him, whether that\u2019s raising money, whatever Sen. Warnock would like the president to do,\u201d Bedingfield told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on \u201cAt This Hour.\u201d\u00a0 Following Biden\u2019s Wednesday evening call with Kevin McCarthy \u2014 the House minority leader running to be the next House Speaker should Republicans take the majority \u2014\u00a0Bedingfield reiterated the president\u2019s efforts to work across the aisle.\u00a0 Bedingfield said that \u201cthe intent of speaking with Kevin McCarthy \u2026 (was) to continue to build a relationship should we need to work together which, you know as the President has said, he is certainly open to.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHe's shown he's been able to do it. The purpose of the conversation was to continue that open line of communication but in terms of sharing details of their private discussion, and I'll leave their private discussion private,\u201d she added.\u00a0 ##Georgia## Ballots are still being counted in Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert's Colorado district, where she is in a tight race against Democrat Adam Frisch.  CNN has not made a projection in the race yet, but Frisch was\u00a0ahead of Boebert by just 386\u00a0as of 12: 30 p.m. ET Thursday.  The boundaries of the 3rd Congressional District\u00a0shifted after Colorado added a new district because the 2020 Census showed population growth, with the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission creating a map that added an eighth seat in the northern suburbs of Denver.\u00a0 Encompassing the western and southern portions of the state that includes Grand Junction, the majority of residents living in Boebert\u2019s district are White and many residents have traditionally registered as Republican.\u00a0 As of Sept. 1, nearly 31% of registered voters were Republican, nearly 24% were Democrat and 44% were unaffiliated with a political party, according to the state\u2019s independent redistricting commissions. Boebert won the county in the 2020 election with 51.4% of the vote, defeating Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush who had 45.2%. Under the new redrawn district, former President Donald Trump would\u2019ve won the district by nearly 8 percentage points but would\u2019ve won by about 5.5 percentage points under the older map. On Wednesday night, Pueblo County Clerk and Recorder Gilbert Ortiz told CNN that Pueblo County, another county in Boebert\u2019s district, was expected to post more votes that night and they would pick back up tomorrow morning at 11 a.m ET (9 a.m local time) Here is what the state's map looked like before and after redistricting:  House Democratic leadership elections have been officially announced for Nov. 30.  Speculation over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s future atop the House Democratic caucus has intensified in the aftermath of the midterm elections. CNN has not yet projected which party will control the House, but Republicans appear to be inching toward picking up the number of seats needed to win back the majority.  CNN reported in September\u00a0that in interviews with more than two dozen House Democrats, a consensus began to emerge: If Democrats lose the majority, there would be overwhelming pressure for Pelosi to go, a prospect that Democratic sources said the powerful House speaker is keenly aware of. Pelosi recently told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that the violent attack on her husband Paul would have an impact on her decision making over her political future, though she did not say what the decision will be.  The elections will be secret ballot using a web-based application. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell would not directly answer when asked by CNN if he blamed former President Donald Trump for the less-than-robust results for Republicans on Election Day.\u00a0 Instead, he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just like all of you,\u00a0I\u2019m watching and waiting for them to finish counting the votes.\" Remember: CNN has not yet projected which party will control the House or the Senate. Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward winning back the majority in the chamber, but many races are still too early to call, and the GOP fell short of what many expected to be a \"red wave\" of victories in Tuesday's midterms.  As McConnell entered his US Capitol office, he also declined to answer if he was confident he will be the majority leader in the new Congress.\u00a0 In the past, McConnell has raised concerns about \u201ccandidate quality,\u201d in reference to some of the candidates Trump backed for the Senate who struggled to gain wide support.\u00a0\u00a0 Washoe County \u2014 Nevada\u2019s second most populous county which encompasses Reno \u2014 still has about 20,000 ballots that it still needs to process.\u00a0 \u201cWe still have about 20,000 votes in our possession that need to be counted.\u00a0More mail-in ballots will arrive today, but we can\u2019t estimate how many,\u201d\u00a0Bethany Drysdale, spokeswoman for Washoe County, tells CNN. The outstanding ballots include both mail-in ballots and ballots that were dropped off on Election Day.\u00a0 Like all counties in Nevada, Washoe is likely to receive more ballots by mail today, after receiving 4,000 yesterday. Ballots that arrive by Saturday will be counted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. ##Nevada## The pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus is currently meeting near Capitol Hill for their new member orientation. Heading into the meeting, GOP Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia told CNN, \u201cwe\u2019re working on it\u201d when asked whether he\u2019ll support House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker. Most other members declined to comment. Their strategy in the speaker\u2019s race \u2013 including what demands they will try to extract and where they will draw hard lines \u2013 is expected to come into sharper focus today and tomorrow. Later Thursday night, the group will hear from Fox News Host Tucker Carlson, who is the keynote speaker at their dinner reception. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes will win in Connecticut's 5th District, CNN projects, and defeat Republican George Logan.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a Democratic hold.  Here's where things stand in the House:  Current Seats held by Democrats: 192\nCurrent seats held by Republicans: 209\nUncalled house races: 34 Democrat John Fetterman's victory over Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz, the cardiothoracic surgeon turned TV doctor, was the culmination of his own political journey, from big, brash small town mayor in Western Pennsylvania to the cusp of membership in one of the country's most traditionally genteel political institutions.\u00a0 In the primary, Fetterman, without a patron or validator, delivered a resounding victory by winning all 67 counties, often by overwhelming margins what ended up being a four-candidate race. He even came away on top in Philadelphia, with nearly 37% of the vote. Fetterman also swept the collar counties around the city, which would become a key focus for him and his opponent in the fall, prevailing in each by an average of almost 25 percentage points. But his triumph was tempered after he revealed in a statement that he had suffered a stroke. The following two months \u2014 which Fetterman spent much of at home recuperating \u2014 ended up being the most critical period of the Democrat's campaign. Unable to do in-person events, the campaign leaned into a hyperactive social media presence, all directed at defining Oz as an out-of-state elitist by using a mix of memes, pithy tweets and, at times, the help of famous celebrities. \"It was a strategic plan to define Oz early and define him as not being from PA or for PA,\" said Rebecca Katz, the campaign's top adviser, adding that Fetterman insisted the content never be \"mean,\" and often spent time during his recovery pinging staff with memes and ideas to connect with the voters with whom he couldn't personally engage. The success of the messaging even surprised Fetterman's top aides. The stickiness of the attacks also struck Republicans. The race grew more competitive after Labor Day, as more voters tuned in to the race and tens of millions of dollars from outside groups like the GOP's Senate Leadership Fund and others led to ads blanketing the airwaves. Questions about Fetterman's heath dominated coverage of the campaign. In a debate with Oz, Fetterman struggled as many expected. But the Fetterman campaign moved quickly to shift the narrative, seizing on one debate line from Oz, and they announced a new ad hammering Oz over his suggestion that \"local political leaders\" should have a hand, along with women and doctors, in the process. The final weeks of the campaign were a nerve-rattling, expensive whirlwind.\u00a0Former President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden appeared for rallies with him across Philadelphia. Aides also pointed to a late endorsement \u2014 delivered with no warning, a few days before the presidential cavalry arrived \u2014 from Oprah Winfrey, who helped launch Oz's TV career. Just days later, Calvello watched silently as Fetterman took the stage on Election Night and immediately touted his campaign's work in typically red enclaves. Democrat Wes Moore\u00a0said becoming the\u00a0first Black governor of Maryland \u2014 and only the third Black person elected governor in US history \u2014 \"means a great deal\" to him. \"I know the history of\u00a0my state.\u00a0This is a state that is a place,\u00a0a birthplace and home place of\u00a0Frederick Douglass and Thurgood Marshall and Harriet Tubman.\u00a0But it is also the birthplace\u00a0of the red line.\u00a0It is the birthplace of some of\u00a0the most historically\u00a0discriminatory policies, the\u00a0most creative discriminatory\u00a0policies that we've seen in\u00a0this country,\" Moore told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday.  When asked about current GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, who has been popular in a largely blue state, Moore expressed appreciation for Hogan tackling more extreme members of his party \u2014 including Moore's Republican gubernatorial opponent Dan Cox, who has questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\u00a0 \u201cI appreciate the current\u00a0governor for calling out these\u00a0MAGA Republicans early,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash.\u00a0 \u201cI think people are tired of\u00a0being at each other's throats.\u00a0I think people are tired of\u00a0caring more about who\u00a0originated [an] idea than \u2018is it\u00a0a good idea?\u2019\u00a0I think as a state, we are\u00a0ready to move fast and we are\u00a0ready to move together,\u201d he added.  Moore tied stumping throughout the state as key to his election victory. \"You go to their territories and\u00a0you make your pitch.\u00a0If you show up, you will see\u00a0exactly what we saw here in the\u00a0state of Maryland yesterday.\u00a0We won, not just Democrats, not\u00a0just Independents, but we took\u00a0a large swath of Republicans.\u00a0That is why I think we saw the\u00a0numbers and the margins that we\u00a0saw in the state of Maryland,\" he told CNN's Abby Philip.  A Republican-led Arizona county plans to appeal a court ruling that blocked its planned hand count audit of ballots cast in this year\u2019s consequential midterm elections. The Cochise County Board of Supervisors voted 2-1 Wednesday to lodge the appeal.\u00a0 The decision comes as key races in Arizona \u2013 including contests for governor and a US Senate seat \u2013 remain too close to call. And the action underscores how much distrust of electronic vote-tallying machines has taken root in parts of the country, following the 2020 presidential election and false claims that widespread fraud contributed to former President Donald Trump\u2019s loss in the state. Superior Court Judge Casey McGinley had blocked the county\u2019s plan earlier this week, ruling that undertaking a broad hand count as a way to check the accuracy of those machines violates state law \u2013 which he said permits election officials to audit only a small percentage of ballots by hand. The proponents of the hand count argued that it \u201cwould help ameliorate fears that the electronic count was incorrect,\u201d McGinley wrote in his 12-page opinion. \u201cHowever, there is no evidence before this Court that electronic tabulation is inaccurate in the first instance, or more importantly, that the audit system established by law is insufficient to detect any inaccuracy it may possess.\u201d It is unclear how consequential the appeal will be to the overall certification of the vote in Arizona. A\u00a0brief submitted on behalf of Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat running for governor, argued that hand counting \u2014 if not completed\u00a0quickly \u2014 could potentially delay the certification of election results. Her brief noted the statutory deadlines that election officials face for certifying the results, which include a deadline for the county to canvass the results by 20 days after the election and a deadline for the secretary to then complete the statewide canvass by the fourth Monday after election day. \u201cCounting just a few races, much less dozens of races, on tens of thousands of ballots by hand is extremely time-intensive, tedious, and prone to human error,\u201d Hobbs wrote in the brief. \u201cThis would be a massive project, for which the extensive planning and preparation required would have been a major effort even if it began months before the election.\u201d Arizona counties must certify their election results by Nov. 28. The state\u2019s certification deadline is Dec. 5.  There are more than 80,000 registered voters in Cochise County, which lies in the southeastern corner of the state and includes the city of Bisbee.  ##Arizona## New York\u00a0Republican\u00a0Representative-elect\u00a0Michael Lawler told CNN that he wants the Republican Party to \"move\u00a0forward\" from former President Donald Trump. \u201cI would like to see the party move forward,\u201d Lawler told CNN. \u201cI think anytime you are focused on the future, you can't so much go to the past. And I think people are really excited about the opportunity to address the challenges that we\u2019re facing as a country, and I think more focus needs to be on the issues and the substance of those issues than on personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Lawler added,\u00a0\"I think\u00a0moving\u00a0in a different\u00a0direction as we\u00a0move\u00a0forward is\u00a0a good thing, not a bad thing.\u00a0But ultimately, look, the voters\u00a0will decide what they want to do,\u00a0and the former president will\u00a0decide what he wants to do.\u201d\u00a0 Lawler was asked if he is interested in focusing any time on investigations and\u00a0potential impeachments of this\u00a0administration. \"I think the top priority is\u00a0to deal with inflation and the\u00a0cost of living.\u00a0That is what I ran on and that\u00a0is what my focus will be ... I don't want to see is what\u00a0we saw during the Trump\u00a0administration where Democrats\u00a0just went after the president\u00a0and the administration\u00a0incessantly,\" he said.\u00a0\"I don't want to go from one\u00a0issue to the next without\u00a0dealing with the issues that got me elected in the first place.\" There are about 400,000 to 410,000 ballots left to count in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Gates told \"CNN This Morning\" on Thursday.\u00a0 Out of the 400,000 to 410,000 left to count, about 290,000 of those ballots were dropped off on Election Day at voting places, Gates said.\u00a0 Out of the remaining 110,000, about 90,000 ballots were received before Election Day.\u00a0 \u201cThese are early ballots that we would have received over the weekend, or, specifically 290,000 that were dropped off on Election Day at our vote centers,\u201d Gates said. About 17,000 of the remaining 110,000 are ballots that were attempted to be counted on Election Day but were not read by the tabulator because of a printer error. These are referred to as \"Box 3\" ballots, Gates said. Gates said he could not predict which votes would be counted first out of the remaining votes to be counted, but he said the ones they received earlier would likely be counted first. \u201cWe can\u2019t really zero in on that with specificity, but they would tend to be those we received earlier first, and then as we move on we\u2019re getting more into those Election Day mail-in ballots that we received on Election Day,\u201d Gates said. Maricopa County is expected to report more results tonight.\u00a0 ##Arizona##\u00a0 Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who is projected to win reelection in the midterms, said a number of voters told him they could not vote for him due to his stance on abortion. \"Certainly, there were people who came up to me and said, 'Mike, I\u00a0like what you're doing, I think\u00a0you've been good on education, you were good during the\u00a0pandemic, you protected us, you did this, but\u00a0I can't vote for you because of\u00a0abortion.\u00a0We certainly did have that,\" he told CNN Thursday. To these voters, abortion\u00a0\"was a defining issue,\" he added.\u00a0\"They simply would not vote for\u00a0me because of the fact that they\u00a0disagreed with me on the issue.\" However, DeWine said he also met people who voted Republican because they liked his accomplishments in office so far.\u00a0 \"We also, though, had a lot of people who\u00a0came up to me and said, 'I don't really vote for\u00a0Republicans, but I like what\u00a0you've done in regard to job\u00a0training,' or 'I like what you've done in regard to mental\u00a0health and I'm going to vote for\u00a0you,\" he said.  Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Republicans underperformed in the 2022 midterms because of many reasons, including Democrats' candidate quality, the Supreme Court's decision on abortion and voter response to former President Donald Trump's role in the party. \"We had some incredible candidates in the Senate and the House,\" she said on \"CNN\u00a0This Morning.\" \"No. 2, when you have a situation that defies the tides of history, it's got to be something monumental going on and in this case, it was a rejection of the orthodoxy of the Republican's position.\u00a0You have so many of their candidates, basically, wanting an abortion ban put in place.\" \"And finally, democracy was on the line. If the Republican Party wants to keep allowing Donald Trump to pick their candidates, you're gonna see the kind of results that you're seeing in red states, blue states and purple states,\" she added. She also said a major priority for her and her colleagues is to pass the Electoral Count Act during the lame-duck session.\u00a0 \"In Washington, we have a bunch of things on our plate, including getting the defense bill done with Ukraine right before us and the strides that [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky is making against [Russia President] Vladimir Putin. On our plate is the end-of-the-year budget bill to make sure we get that right. As you know, the Electoral Count Act, an effort that I'm leading with Susan Collins and Joe Manchin and others, so we don't have\u00a0Jan. 6\u00a0happen again. All of that is immediately when we get back.\" Republican\u00a0Georgia Lt. Gov Geoff Duncan told CNN that after Tuesday night's election results, former President Donald Trump was fired by Republicans.\u00a0\u00a0 \"There's no way to deny the\u00a0Donald Trump got fired Tuesday night. The search committee has brought a few names to the top of the list, and\u00a0Ron DeSantis is one of them.\u00a0Ron DeSantis is being rewarded for a new\u00a0thought process with\u00a0Republicans and that solid\u00a0leadership,\" he said Thursday.\u00a0 Duncan also said that Georgia's Republican Senate candidate\u00a0Herschel Walker\u00a0needs to make three important phone calls to win the runoff.\u00a0 \"Make\u00a0three successful phone calls. One is to tell Donald\u00a0Trump to stay out of Georgia for four weeks.\u00a0He is toxic, he would do\u00a0nothing to help the ticket.\u00a0Secondly, I would pick up the\u00a0phone and call Brian Kemp and ask him for his help.\u00a0Apologize for not\u00a0endorsing him during the\u00a0primary against David Perdue. And third, I would call Ron DeSantis and ask him\u00a0to come to\u00a0Georgia as often as he possibly\u00a0can the next four weeks. That would be\u00a0a winning recipe\u00a0for Herschel Walker,\" Duncan told CNN. ##Georgia## Watch here for more: With the Georgia runoff campaign between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker already underway, money is pouring into the state as the parties and interest groups seek to shape its outcome.\u00a0 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a $7 million field organizing investment to boost Warnock.\u00a0 \u201cWe know talking directly to voters through a strong, well-funded ground-game is critical to winning in Georgia, and we\u2019re wasting no time in kick-starting these programs in the runoff,\u201d\u00a0said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Sen. Gary Peters.\u00a0\u201cThe DSCC is proud to partner with the Warnock campaign to build off their strong field programs and launch an unprecedented organizing effort in the runoff that will ensure we reach every voter we need to win on December 6th.\u201d\u00a0 The DSCC has made investments in field organizing programs a top priority, spending more on direct voter contact programs this cycle than in the Independent Expenditure for the first time in recent history.\u00a0 An anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and its partner group, Women Speak Out PAC, announced it will spend at least $1 million in the race to attack Warnock's position on abortion. \u201cWalker\u2019s support for compassionate limits on abortion aligns with the people of Georgia and the\u00a0overwhelming majority of\u00a0Americans, in stark contrast to \u2018activist pastor\u2019 Warnock\u2019s radical\u00a0position\u00a0of abortion on demand until\u00a0birth, paid for\u00a0by taxpayers. Our ground team will continue to visit voters at their homes to expose Warnock\u2019s extremism and urge them to elect Walker as their champion in the U.S. Senate,\u201d said SBA\u00a0Pro-Life\u00a0America\u00a0President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement.  ##Georgia## House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged Thursday that after the midterm elections, Democrats will need to partner with Republicans on taking steps to fight climate change, even as she cast doubt on the opposing party's willingness to take action. \"It's hard to speak in terms of the midterm elections in this subject because we have had, shall we say, a disagreement on the subject,\" Pelosi said during an event at the COP27 conference being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. \"Our colleagues said why are we having this discussion, there is no climate crisis, it\u2019s all a hoax,\" she said of the GOP reaction to investments meant to combat climate change that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act. \"We have to get over that. I place my confidence in their children, who will hopefully teach their parents that this is urgent, long overdue.\" Pelosi is leading a congressional delegation to the climate summit comprised only of Democrats. A separate group of House Republicans representing the\u00a0Conservative\u00a0Climate\u00a0Caucus\u00a0is also present. Pelosi didn't respond to questions about whether Democrats can retain a majority at the end of her event. Voters in several states have approved progressive measures that could not get through a Democratic-led Congress or Republican-dominated statehouses. More low-income South Dakota residents will have access to Medicaid, and Arizona residents with medical debt will get more protections. Minimum wage workers in Nebraska\u00a0will get a boost in pay. Here\u2019s a sampling of the ballot measures: South Dakota will expand Medicaid in 2023 The measure passed 56% to 44%, according to South Dakota Secretary of State data, broadening Medicaid to roughly 42,500 low-income residents starting in mid-2023. It will open up coverage to adults making less than roughly $19,000 a year. Currently, childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid in South Dakota, and parents must have very low incomes to qualify \u2013 about $1,000 a month for a family of four. Many Republican officials opposed the measure, citing its potential future costs. States are responsible for picking up 10% of the health care tab of the expansion enrollees. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, did not support the initiative. An expansion bill failed in a state Senate vote earlier this year.  The minimum wage will rise in Nebraska Nebraska's minimum wage will increase to $15 an hour by 2026, up from the current $9 an hour. The vote was 58% to 42% in favor, according to Nebraska Secretary of State data. It is expected to benefit about 150,000 workers, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute, which are both left-leaning groups. Opponents, however, said that the initiative would hurt businesses in the state and reduce employment opportunities for youth. Medical debt measures approved in Arizona Proposition 209 passed overwhelmingly by a 72% to 28% vote, according to Arizona Secretary of State data. It will cap the interest rate on medical debt at 3% and limit wage garnishment for medical debt to a maximum of 30% of earnings. The measure will not forgive any medical debt, McLeod said. Opponents argued the initiative will make it harder for Arizonans to obtain credit and for businesses in the state to collect on debt, as well as increase interest rates on consumer debt. Control of\u00a0the US Senate\u00a0could hinge on Nevada and Arizona, two states where GOP victories could elevate some of the\u00a0most prominent election deniers\u00a0in the country even after other nominees who had amplified former President Donald Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the 2020 election were\u00a0rejected\u00a0by voters in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. Those two western states \u2013 perpetual battlegrounds in presidential years \u2013 were still too early to call as of early Thursday morning, while a third Democratic-held seat, Georgia, will advance to a December runoff, CNN projects.  Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the majority. As ballots continue to be counted across the country, Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, albeit one that\u2019s much narrower than they\u2019d hoped. The struggle for the Senate, however, is still full of unknowns \u2013 including whether it will all come down once again to Georgia after the Peach State delivered Democrats the majority in 2021 with victories in twin runoffs. It\u2019s Nevada and Arizona that will determine how pivotal Georgia becomes. Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining an edge over Republican Blake Masters as of early Thursday morning, while Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was trailing Republican Adam Laxalt. CNN had estimated late Wednesday that about 600,000 votes remained to be counted across the Grand Canyon State and about 160,000 votes remained to be counted in Nevada. Laxalt, Nevada\u2019s former attorney general, was a co-chairman of Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign in the state and filed lawsuits attempting to overturn Nevada\u2019s results in that election, which he said was \u201crigged.\u201d Cortez Masto had argued that the lies and election conspiracies theories embraced by Trump and allies like Laxalt led to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Masters, a venture capitalist and first-time candidate, released a campaign video as he was competing for the GOP nomination in which he said he believed Trump had won the 2020 election. Masters, like Laxalt, clinched Trump\u2019s endorsement. After winning the Arizona Senate primary, Masters briefly appeared to back away from some of that extreme rhetoric \u2013\u00a0scrubbing his website, for example, of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. In a debate with Kelly, he also conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. But the Republican nominee seemed to reverse course after receiving a\u00a0phone call\u00a0from Trump urging him to \u201cgo stronger\u201d on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary. Keep reading here. ##Nevada## ##Arizona## Reports of alleged intimidation or harassment of Arizona voters continued to flow into the Secretary of State\u2019s office in the runup to Election Day, with state officials forwarding a total of 21 complaints \u2013\u00a0including one threatening government officials\u00a0\u2014 to federal and\u00a0state\u00a0law enforcement, according to information released Wednesday. None of the reports involve physical violence, but they do describe voters feeling uncomfortable or nervous as people surveilled drop boxes.\u00a0 In one complaint lodged this week, a voter in Surprise, Arizona, a community northwest of Phoenix, recounted dropping off a completed ballot Monday at city hall and\u00a0encountering\u00a0four individuals, including one wearing a \u201cMAGA\u201d shirt, sitting nearby. \u201cOne of them approached me, encouraging me to vote tomorrow instead because \u2018your vote won\u2019t count the same if you vote early,\u2019\" the voter said. \u201cI'm concerned that this group may have dissuaded people from voting today.\u201d The voter said the men had no identifying credentials. The names of people making the complaints are redacted in the documents the secretary of state\u2019s office has publicly released.\u00a0 One of the 21 complaints involved a threat against\u00a0government officials. The Oct. 22 email,\u00a0which said it was a warning to \u201cCorrupt and Treasonous Government Officials\u201d, mentioned the violence of the French Revolution and promised to use property tax records to find workers\u2019 homes. The Secretary of State\u2019s office has referred it to the FBI.\u00a0 All of the complaints forwarded to federal and state law enforcement so far involve reports of alleged intimidation before Election Day. Earlier this month, a federal judge blocked members of a right-wing group from openly carrying guns or wearing body armor within 250 feet of drop boxes\u00a0in Arizona\u00a0or from speaking to or yelling at voters dropping off their ballots. ##Arizona## In his first speech since polls closed around the country Tuesday night,\u00a0President  Biden\u00a0called out detractors who he said doubted his \u201cincessant optimism\u201d about Democrats\u2019\u00a0ability to stave off resounding Republican\u00a0wins in the midterm elections \u2013 even as his presidency is now likely entering a new period of divided government. The results, he said during a press conference at the White House Wednesday, are a sign American democracy is intact, despite coming under threat over the past several years. \u201cWe had an election yesterday,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd it was a good day, I think, for democracy.\u201d \u201cOur democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cwhile the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The results were neither the \u201cthumping\u201d George W. Bush described during his own post-midterms press conference in 2006 nor the \u201cshellacking\u2019\u201d Barack Obama said Democrats endured in 2010. Instead, the failure of a so-called \u201cred wave\u201d to materialize Tuesday night had Biden appearing confident, reflecting the mood of\u00a0Democrats, including those inside the White House, who are\u00a0feeling enthused and vindicated following an election season where the president\u2019s political aptitude was questioned. At the time of Biden\u2019s remarks, CNN has not been able to project the future majorities of the House or the Senate. Read the full story here. If Georgia voters were hoping to avoid talking politics at Thanksgiving, the state\u2019s\u00a0tightly contested Senate race\u00a0has other plans. Neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican challenger Herschel Walker surpassed the 50% threshold needed to win the race outright Tuesday evening, CNN projects, forcing a runoff election set for Dec. 6. But what exactly does that mean? And how will the runoff election work? Here\u2019s what you need to know:  What is a runoff and how does it work? A runoff is an additional election used to determine the winner of a certain race when neither candidate earns the required threshold for victory \u2013 in this case, 50%. In Georgia, runoffs are more straightforward than general elections in that the candidate with the most votes wins regardless of whether they reach 50% or not. Georgia\u2019s top elections official,\u00a0Brad Raffensperger, said counties are already preparing for the Dec. 6 election, and voters can request absentee ballots starting Wednesday through November 28 via the state\u2019s online portal. Early voting must begin by November 28 in all counties, but Raffensperger said his office anticipates some counties could have early voting on Saturday, November 26 or Sunday, Nov. 27. \u201cWe are working with the counties to find out what their plans are on this front,\u201d he said. Notably, the logistics of the 2022 runoff will be different than in years passed. The 2021 Georgia law that cut the length of runoffs from nine weeks to four means that the deadline for a new voter to register for the runoff election has already passed. What is at stake? Put simply, a lot. Depending on the outcome of\u00a0Senate races in Arizona and Nevada, voters in Georgia could then \u2013 for the second consecutive election cycle \u2013 have the Senate majority in their hands. Top officials from the Democratic and Republican parties told CNN they intend to double down on their significant investments in Georgia, with an increasing assumption that control of the Senate could hinge on the outcome of the runoff. ##Georgia##"

  "text": "Our live coverage of the 2022 midterms elections has moved here. Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana. Here's what we know so far: Marijuana Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement. Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement.\u00a0 Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri:\u00a0Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children.\u00a0 North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in \"various forms\" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility \"for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides\" and subject to random inspection.\u00a0Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November.\u00a0 South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem\u2019s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state\u2019s constitution. The Republican governor\u2019s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed.\u00a0 Voting Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, \u201cyes\u201d needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election.\u00a0 Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.\u00a0 ##Catch Up##\u00a0 The\u00a0battle for control\u00a0of Congress \u2013 both the House and the Senate \u2013 is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans\u2019 hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities. Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run. But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority \u2013 one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021\u2019s redistricting \u2013 remains unsettled. Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races: Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race: \u201cThis is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,\u201d said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman\u2019s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories \u2013 CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs \u2013 but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave. Virginia\u2019s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night\u2019s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia\u2019s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia\u2019s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria. Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points. DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida \u2013 delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida\u2019s status as a national bellwether. GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump\u2019s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it\u2019ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida. Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer \u2013 who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state\u2019s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances \u2013 defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state\u2019s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights. A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.  ##Catch Up## \u00a0 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a\u00a0tweet\u00a0from the county\u2019s elections department. Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said. As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead. Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical\u00a0problems\u00a0with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite\u00a0claims\u00a0to the contrary. ##Voting## Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects. CNN\u00a0found\u00a0that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have\u00a0rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose: Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden\u2019s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)\nDan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn\u2019t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021.\nPaul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was \u201cclearly a stolen election.\u201d\nLee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden\u2019s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.\nGeoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn\u2019t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.\nScott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state\u2019s Democratic elections chief.\u00a0\nTim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.\u201d\nTudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes.\u00a0\nHeidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate. Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include: Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\nBrad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden\u2019s win.\nKim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).\nGreg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state.\u00a0\nKristi Noem of South Dakota, who\u00a0baselessly\u00a0claimed\u00a0on Twitter that Trump was fighting \u201crigged election systems\u201d and hinted that there were issues in \u201cDemocrat-run\u201d states. ##Catch Up## Democratic Rep.

Who decides that?\u00a0\u201cKey race\u201d is a subjective term. Most politics watchers generally agree that only a subset of races is truly competitive in November, and these are generally considered the key races. Political parties spend more money on these races. Reporters spend more time covering them.\u00a0\u00a0 Of the 35 Senate races on the ballot in 2022, the election forecasters at Inside Elections considered three to be true toss-ups and another four to tilt toward either Republicans or Democrats.\u00a0\u00a0 Nineteen House races are true toss-ups, although many more could wind up being closely contested. Five governor races are toss-ups.\u00a0\u00a0See the Inside Elections ratings for\u00a0Senate,\u00a0House\u00a0and\u00a0governor.\u00a0\u00a0 Key races can also be races that might be less competitive but have broader implications or feature especially notable candidates.\u00a0\u00a0 What factors help CNN make projections?\u00a0Using a mix of many factors, including current and previous election results, real-time exit polling, recent opinion polls, voter registration data and more, CNN\u2019s decision desk is frequently able to reliably project that a candidate has received enough support to win. It is a projection, however, and not the final word. State officials and courts have the official say.\u00a0\u00a0 Can CNN project a race without any votes in?\u00a0This is a task CNN takes very seriously. Based on previous election results, exit polling, recent opinion polls, early voter turnout and other factors, it is sometimes possible to see that one particular candidate will win a race. If there is any chance of an upset, CNN will refrain from projecting a race.\u00a0 \u00a0 Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, an incumbent House lawmaker, defeated Republican challenger Tyler Kistner in Minnesota\u2019s competitive 2nd Congressional District.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democrat Wiley Nickel has defeated Republican Bo Hines in a competitive North Carolina House race for the 13th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 Nickel is a Democratic state senator. Hines is a 27-year-old political newcomer and former college football player who won former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement ahead of the primary. As a result of Trump\u2019s endorsement, the race has been viewed as a test of the former president\u2019s influence.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright will hold on to his seat in Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Jim Bognet in a second consecutive general election.\u00a0 Cartwright beat Bognet, a former political consultant, by only about three and a half percentage points in 2020 and was considered an underdog to defend the seat again this year. But his winning streak on increasingly red turf remains intact, even as his vote-share has trended down over the years.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 With the balance of the House and Senate coming down to a handful of key states, the race for control is getting tighter. Here are some of the key headlines from the midterms as results continue to come in: Brad Raffensperger will stay Georgia\u2019s election chief Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused former President Donald Trump's\u00a0request to \"find\" the votes\u00a0needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State, will win reelection, CNN projects.\u00a0 John Fetterman beats Mehmet Oz Fetterman, the Democratic nominee, thanked supporters and those who voted for him after CNN projected he would win, saying, \"I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue. But we did what we needed to do.\" J.D. Vance takes Ohio Senate seat Voters from union households in Ohio favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to the early results of the\u00a0Ohio exit poll\u00a0conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has won reelection Whitmer defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in one of the nation\u2019s most important political battleground states, CNN projects. Whitmer won a second term after a campaign that focused largely on her support for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe v. Wade. Abortion on the ballot Californians have voted to explicitly and more clearly protect abortion rights in the state by amending language in the state constitution.\nMichigan also approved a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution, a move that will block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.\nVoters in Vermont approved an amendment that will protect \"every person's right to make their own reproductive decisions,\" including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control.\u00a0\u00a0 Here's a look at how Michigan's voter turnout for the measure stacks up: ##Catch Up## Pennsylvania voters who most valued \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d in their Senate candidate favored Democrat\u00a0John Fetterman\u00a0over Republican Mehmet Oz, according to the early results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Fetterman also won among voters who said they wanted a candidate who cared about people like them, while Oz won among the smaller bloc of voters who prioritized a candidate sharing their values. CNN projects that Fetterman will defeat Oz to win the open Pennsylvania Senate race, flipping a Republican-held seat. A majority of female voters, White college-educated voters, voters of color and political independents supported Fetterman, the exit poll finds, while most male voters and White voters without college degrees supported Oz. Most voters, about 53%, said they disapproved of President Joe Biden\u2019s job performance. But roughly 14% of those who disapproved of Biden cast their ballots for Fetterman, as did nearly all of those who approved of the president. A slim majority of voters in the state said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, with most also saying former President Donald Trump did not play a role. Voters were close to evenly split on whether or not Oz\u2019s views were too extreme, while about 53% said Fetterman\u2019s views were not. Voters in Pennsylvania were closely split over whether Fetterman\u2019s health was good enough to represent the state effectively. Fetterman, Pennsylvania\u2019s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before the May Democratic primary. But a majority of voters said that Oz has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades. ##Analysis## ##Senate## Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson will win in Iowa\u2019s 2nd District, CNN projects. ##House## Georgia's incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock addressed supporters in Atlanta just before 2 a.m. ET with results still trickling in and acknowledged that the race wouldn\u2019t be called tonight as it still is too close to call. \u201cWe're not sure if this journey is over today, or if there's still a little work yet to do, but here's what we do know. We know that when they're finished counting the votes from today's election, that we're going to have received more votes than my opponent,\u201d Warnock said.\u00a0 Neither candidate has cleared the 50% benchmark to win the race outright.\u00a0 During his brief remarks, Warnock urged supporters to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhether it's later tonight, or tomorrow, or four weeks from now, we will hear from the people of Georgia,\" he said.  ##Senate## John Fetterman will defeat Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race, CNN projects, picking up a seat for Democrats after the retirement of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor since 2019, is still recovering from a stroke he suffered before the primary. At his election night party, he thanked his supporters and said he felt \u201cso humbled.\u201d \u201cWe bet on the people of Pennsylvania, and you didn\u2019t let us down,\u201d he said. See more photos from Fetterman\u2019s watch party: Democrat Chris Deluzio will win the open House seat in Pennsylvania\u2019s 17th Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Jeremy Schaffer in their contest to replace departing Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb. Lamb, who won the Western Pennsylvania seat twice, retired from the House to run in the Democratic Senate primary, which he lost to Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. Deluzio, a voting rights attorney and Iraq War veteran, ran neck-and-neck with Schaffer in most pre-election polling, and many in both parties viewed their race as a national bellwether. ##House## Republican Monica De La Cruz will win the contest in Texas\u2019 15th Congressional District, CNN projects, signaling that her party has deepened its inroads with Latino voters in the Rio Grande Valley. De La Cruz will defeat Democrat Michelle Vallejo in a contest that national Democrats had effectively given up on weeks before Election Day by directing their spending to other races. De La Cruz campaigned on a return to former President Donald Trump\u2019s border policies, and she embraced Trump\u2019s falsehoods about election fraud, questioning her own loss in a 2020 congressional race. ##House## Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan held onto her seat in New Hampshire Tuesday night.\u00a0She took the stage at her Manchester Election Night headquarters around 11:15 p.m. ET to supporters chanting, \u201csix more years!\u201d Hassan thanked supporters before acknowledging her opponent, Republican Don Bolduc.\u00a0She shushed the crowd when they began to jeer at the mention of Bolduc\u2019s name.\u00a0 \u201cI want to take a minute to thank Don Bolduc for a hard-fought campaign and I want to thank Don Bolduc for his service to this country. We have differences, but we share a love for this country,\u201d said Hassan, before turning her message of unity to Granite State voters. \u201cI promise you, Democrats, Independents and Republicans \u2014 the people who voted for me and those who did not \u2014 that I will keep working every day to serve you faithfully, to listen to you and to work with you to address the challenges facing your families, our state and the country.\u201d Hassan\u2019s victory speech focused on bipartisanship, with a commitment to work across the aisle on the economy and a nod to issues championed by her opponent on the trail.\u00a0 \u201cI will keep reaching out to colleagues from both sides of the aisle defined shared goals and the common ground and compromise necessary to help families and small businesses with the challenges that they face, like the high cost of housing and childcare,\u201d said Hassan.\u00a0\u201cOf course, in order to have an economy that works, we have to be safe. The safety of our citizens and our nation is always government's first responsibility. And I will keep working to support our brave men and women of law enforcement and to keep our country safe.\u201d Meanwhile, Bolduc whose campaign had been bolstered by a polling surge in the final few weeks, addressed his supporters just before 11 p.m. ET, acknowledging Hassan\u2019s win to the crowd but noting he\u2019d not yet called the Democrat to concede at that time.\u00a0 \u201cMaggie Hassan has won,\u201d said Bolduc to a thinned-out crowd at his Manchester Election Night headquarters, \u201cI was told the protocol was to call her first, but I\u2019m not one for protocol. I wanted to tell my supporters first.\u201d\u00a0 The Republican added, \u201cThis is not a loss. We woke a lot of people up. Hopefully, we put her on notice. And hopefully, she\u2019ll do the right thing for New Hampshire.\" Bolduc read from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cIf\u201d to the crowd of supporters before telling them, \u201cRight now, in this nation, there are a lot of \u201cifs.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0We have done something here in NH. We have created a rumble.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t win today, but imagine 'if' we continue to come together, if we join hands, if we decided that they work for us and we don\u2019t work for them,\u201d the retired US Army General continued, \u201cWe demand that they do the right thing for us, our children and our great grandchildren [\u2026] if we can do this, even in losing we will win.\u201d Bolduc, who earlier sang \u201cCountry Roads\u201d on stage with the band performing Tuesday night, closed by telling the room to \u201clive free or die, baby\u201d\u2014 a reference to the Granite State\u2019s motto.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement on tonight\u2019s results, saying that while there are several races that remain too close to call \"it is clear that House Democratic Members and candidates are strongly outperforming expectations across the country.\"\u00a0 She continued: \"As states continue to tabulate the final results, every vote must be counted as cast. Many thanks to our grassroots volunteers for enabling every voter to have their say in our Democracy.\u201d The House and Senate, where Democrats currently hold narrow majorities, are up for grabs. Republicans need net gains of five seats to win the House. ##House## Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz will win reelection in Hawaii, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Bob McDermott.\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Californians have voted to explicitly and more clearly protect abortion rights in the state. A \"yes\" vote\u00a0amended the California Constitution to say that the \"state shall not deny or interfere with an individual's reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.\" Currently, the state constitution guarantees a right to privacy, which the California Supreme Court has ruled includes the right to have an abortion.\u00a0 In May, following the leak of the US Supreme Court's draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, California Democratic leaders Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement that they would propose an amendment \"so that there is no doubt as to the right to abortion in this state.\" The Democratic-controlled state legislature in June approved putting the amendment on the November ballot. ##Catch Up## Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in one of the nation\u2019s most important political battleground states.\u00a0\u00a0 Whitmer won a second term after a campaign that focused largely on her support for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe v. Wade. She successfully sued to block the enforcement of Michigan\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, and also championed a citizens\u2019 initiative on this fall\u2019s ballot that would amend the state\u2019s constitution to guarantee abortion rights.\u00a0\u00a0 Her victory cements Whitmer\u2019s place -- two years after she was a finalist for President Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential pick -- as a leading figure within the Democratic Party moving forward.\u00a0\u00a0 And it demonstrates the limits of voters\u2019 willingness to punish officials in competitive states who took strict measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including school and business closures.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0\u00a0 Michigan on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution, a move that will block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects. The passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an \u201cindividual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.\u201d Backers of the amendment have said it will block Michigan\u2019s 1931 abortion law, which bans all abortions except to save the mother\u2019s life. The amendment allows the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability, except if needed to protect a patient's life or physical or mental health. It also bars the state from prosecuting an individual for having an abortion or miscarriage or from prosecuting someone who assists a pregnant person in \"exercising rights established by this amendment.\" The proposal had to overcome legal challenges to be included on the ballot, with the Michigan Supreme Court ordering officials in September to include the question on ballots in a 5-2 ruling. ##Catch Up## Voters in Vermont approved an amendment to the state\u2019s constitution to further protect abortion rights, CNN projects. \u00a0 The amendment, supporters say, will protect \"every person's right to make their own reproductive decisions,\" including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control. \u00a0 The Vermont Constitution will now be amended to read: \"That an individual's right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one's own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.\" ##Catch Up## About half of New Hampshire voters called Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc\u2019s views \u201ctoo extreme,\u201d according to the early results of the New Hampshire exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.  Only about 43% said the same of his Democratic rival, incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan. CNN projects that Hassan will win a second Senate term in New Hampshire, defeating the Trump-backed Bolduc. President Joe Biden\u2019s job approval rating in the state is negative, per the exit poll, with only about 42% of voters approving. But roughly 1 in 5 Biden disapprovers, nevertheless, cast their vote for Hassan. Roughly three-quarters of voters in the state \u2013 including similar shares of both candidates\u2019 supporters \u2013 said that party control of the Senate was very important to their vote. ##Analysis## ##Senate## Republican Sen. Mike Lee will win reelection in Utah, CNN projects, staving off a \t\tchallenge by independent Evan McMullin.\u00a0 Lee\u2019s win does little to shift the balance of power in the Senate -- Utah was seen as a reliable Republican win and Lee has held the seat since 2011. But McMullin, who said during the race that he would not caucus with either Democrats or Republicans if he were to win the seat, gave Lee a tougher-than-expected race by making it a referendum on former President Donald Trump\u2019s dominance of the Republican Party and the Lee\u2019s shift from a Trump critic to a Trump devotee.\u00a0 Utah Democrats opted not to put up their own nominee to challenge Lee, viewing McMullin as the best chance in decades for a non-Republican to win a Senate seat in the state.\u00a0 McMullin\u2019s attacks focused on Lee\u2019s tightness with Trump and his actions around the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol, most notably texts he sent to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe talk about 9/11, but I have to say, it shook me in the same way,\u201d McMullin said during the campaign. \u201cDifferent type of event. But just as dark, just as evil.\u201d\u00a0 Lee pushed back against those attacks during a debate between the two candidates, claiming he was \u201cone of the people trying to dismantle this situation, trying to stop it from happening.\u201d\u00a0 Utah is home to one of the largest voting blocs of anti-Trump Republicans: In 2016, McMullin won over 21% of the vote in a longshot presidential bid; while in 2020, Trump only won 58% of the vote in the state, far lower than many recent Republican nominees.\u00a0 There was an awkwardness to the race, too. In 2016, Lee publicly said he voted for McMullin over Trump, something the independent candidate tried to use against Lee.\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Democrat John Fetterman, who CNN projects will defeat Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania's Senate race,\u00a0said he is humbled to serve as the state's next senator. \u201cI'm so humbled, thank you so much,\u201d he told his supporters. He pointed to his campaign's slogan of \"every county, every vote.\" Fetterman added, \"We jammed them up.\" \u201cI\u2019m proud of what we ran on \u2014\u00a0protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, raising the minimum wage, fighting the union way of life,\" he said. \"Healthcare is a fundamental human right. It saved my life and it should all be there for you if you should ever need it,\" he said, referring to the stroke he had earlier this year. He thanked supporters and those who voted for him, saying, \"I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue. But we did what we needed to do.\" \u201cWe bet on the people of Pennsylvania and you didn\u2019t let us down. And my promise to all of you is I will never let all of you down,\" Fetterman added. ##Senate## Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican challenger Tim Michels and preserving Democrats\u2019 veto power in a state where the GOP-led legislature is seeking veto-proof supermajorities. Evers overcame weeks of attacks from Michels, a construction executive backed by former President Donald Trump, and other Republicans who portrayed him as soft on crime.\u00a0 He campaigned on his support for abortion rights in a state where an 1849 law banning abortions in almost all instances, including rape and incest, took effect after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June. Republicans in the legislature have so far declined to change that law.\u00a0\u00a0 Evers\u2019 victory could stymie Republican efforts to implement new restrictions on mail-in voting, defang the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission and more ahead of a 2024 presidential race in which Wisconsin is set to once again play a crucial role.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor## Voters from union households in Ohio favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to the early results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Nearly 6 in 10 voters from union households cast ballots for Vance, who also garnered about the same level of support from men who voted and White voters. More than half of Buckeye State voters age 45 and older, voters without college degrees and those living in suburban and rural parts of the state opted for Vance, as well. Ryan was the preferred candidate of just more than half of women who voted, independent voters, college-educated voters and younger voters. Roughly 6 in 10 voters who live in Ohio cities went for Ryan, as did more than three-quarters of voters of color in the state. Voters who said they were most concerned about crime, inflation and immigration broke for Vance, while those who thought abortion and gun policy were top issues selected Ryan. Vance was the choice of voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values, but Ryan was supported by those looking for a candidate who cares about people like them and a candidate who has honesty and integrity.

Democrats now have secured 47 Senate seats to Republicans' 46, so far.  It's still too early to call who will control the chamber with seven seats yet to be projected including in Georgia and Arizona. ##Senate## More than two-thirds of voters for House candidates don\u2019t want\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0to run for reelection in 2024, according to the early results of the national exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. More than 7 in 10 independent voters and roughly 9 in 10 Republican voters said they don\u2019t want Biden to be in the 2024 presidential campaign. Fewer than 6 in 10 Democratic voters thought he should run. Just under 6 in 10 independent voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, and about the same share disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing as president. Only 1 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of the president and slightly more disapprove of his job performance. More than 9 in 10 GOP voters have an unfavorable view of Biden and disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing. When it comes to former\u00a0President Donald Trump, two-thirds of independent voters and more than 9 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of him. Just over three-quarters of GOP voters have a favorable view. Independent voters comprise about a quarter of the electorate, while Democratic voters are roughly one-third and Republican voters are just over one-third of the electorate. ##Analysis## Democrat John Fetterman will win the Pennsylvania Senate race, CNN projects, defeating Republican Mehmet Oz and helping Democrats pick up the seat following the retirement of GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman, the lieutenant governor since 2019, and Oz, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, ran one of the most contentious and expensive Senate contests in the country \u2013 all of it while Fetterman continued his recovery from a pre-primary stroke that often limited his ability to speak on the trail.\u00a0\u00a0 For Democrats trying to preserve their control of what has been a Senate split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote, Fetterman\u2019s win could prove decisive. The commonwealth entered Election Day as one of at least nine states holding what were expected to be competitive Senate races.\u00a0\u00a0 Fetterman\u2019s victory caps a remarkable ascent from his time as mayor of small Braddock, a borough in western Pennsylvania, to the lieutenant governor\u2019s office -- which he won after unseating a fellow Democrat in a 2018 primary -- and now, the US Senate. A longtime progressive, he is an outspoken supporter of abolishing the filibuster, raising the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana, criminal justice reform and passing legislation to protect same-sex marriage, among other leading liberal priorities.\u00a0 His success will also provide inspiration to stroke survivors and other disabled Americans, some of whom took heart from his efforts to carry on campaigning even as he exhibited the lingering effects of his May stroke. Fetterman, though he has not released his full medical records, has said he expects to be at or near full strength by the time he takes office early next year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Though Oz himself largely steered clear of disparaging Fetterman over his stroke-related difficulties, his campaign was less cautious, leading the Republican to repeatedly distance himself from his own staffers\u2019 remarks. Asked at one point late in the campaign whether he would speak to his own patients the way his campaign addressed Fetterman, Oz responded with one word: \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 CNN hosts react: ##Senate## Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer spoke moments ago as polls show her leading her race. She didn't declare victory, but Whitmer said \"we are feeling damn good about where we are heading.\" CNN is yet to make a projection in the race.  Whitmer thanked the crowd and said that Michigan voters' \"voices were heard\" and they \"set our state on the course that is focused on the future.\" \"We have come a long way, Michigan,\" Whitmer said, adding that her campaign is \"thrilled at the unexpected high turnout.\" She invited those in attendance to \"come back in the morning.\" \"We will be ready to talk about what the future of this state is for the next four years,\" Whitmer said. ##Governor## Twenty-one candidates in these 14 states made history, so far, on Election night:  Alabama\nArkansas\nCalifornia\nConnecticut\nFlorida\nIllinois\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nNew York\nOhio\nOklahoma\nPennsylvania\nVermont  Some Republican candidates who have denied or refused to affirm the results of the 2020 election will be elected as state elections chief, CNN projects \u2014 though others will be defeated. Here are three Republican secretary of state winners CNN has projected so far:\u00a0 Alabama: State Rep. Wes Allen, who\u00a0endorsed\u00a0the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory.\nIndiana:\u00a0Diego Morales,\u00a0a former Mike Pence aide who wrote an\u00a0article\u00a0during the 2022 primary in which he falsely called the\u00a02020\u00a0election a \u201cscam\u201d and wrongly said \u201cthe outcome is questionable.\u201d\nSouth Dakota: Monae Johnson, who repeatedly\u00a0refused\u00a0in an October 2022 interview to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately. In addition, Republican candidate Chuck Gray of\u00a0Wyoming\u00a0ran unopposed for secretary of state in the general election after winning the Republican primary.\u00a0\u00a0 Here are\u00a0five\u00a0election deniers CNN projects will lose their 2022 races: Massachusetts: Rayla Campbell, who\u00a0falsely claimed\u00a0Donald Trump was the real winner of a \u201cstolen\u201d 2020 election.\nMinnesota: Kim Crockett,\u00a0who baselessly\u00a0said\u00a0Minnesota\u2019s 2020 election was \u201clawless\u201d and that she agreed with an interviewer who called it \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\nNew Mexico:\u00a0Audrey Trujillo, who also falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from Trump.\u00a0\nVermont: H.

CNN had not yet projected the other races as of midnight ET on Wednesday morning. ##Other Races## It\u2019s 1 a.m. ET, and polls are now closing across Alaska. \t\u00a0 These are the key races in the state: GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski has survived tough elections before \u2013 she won her 2010 Senate race as a write-in candidate \u2013 but now she is facing Trump-endorsed opponent Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska\u2019s first ranked-choice Senate election.\u00a0\u00a0 The independent-minded Murkowski has frequently been a target of Trump and his supporters, especially since she voted to convict in Trump\u2019s second impeachment. Murkowski won 45% in the top-four primary while Tshibaka, the former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Administration got 39%.\u00a0\u00a0 If no candidate wins a majority of first choice votes, the election will be decided by ranked choice voting and the second choices of supporters of Democrat Patricia Chesbro could be key. \t\u00a0 In the House race, Rep. Mary Peltola won a special election in August to replace long-time Republican Don Young, who died in March, and she\u2019s hoping to repeat the feat.\u00a0\u00a0 Peltola will face the same two Republicans in Alaska\u2019s ranked-choice system. Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee, is backed by Trump and finished second to Peltola in August.\u00a0\u00a0 Nick Begich, who has a name well known in Alaska politics, argues that he can beat Peltola in the ranked-choice tabulation, after many of his voters spurned Palin on their special election ballots. Peltola led the top-four primary with nearly 37% of the vote.\u00a0 Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused former President Donald Trump's request to \"find\" the votes needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State, will win reelection, CNN projects.\u00a0 Raffensperger's rebuff \u2013 and role as a witness before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u2013 has made him one of the country\u2019s best-known election chiefs.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I've had to stand up to incredible pressure,\" the Republican said, during a recent candidate debate. \"Many people buckled and folded. I didn't, and I won't.\"\u00a0 He defeated the Democratic nominee, state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a rising political star in her party. She had put expanding access to the ballot at the center of her candidacy and sought to make history by becoming the first Asian-American elected to a statewide political office in Georgia.\u00a0 The two have clashed over Raffensperger\u2019s support of SB202, an elections bill approved by the Georgia General Assembly last year that imposed a range of new voting restrictions, including adding new identification requirements to vote by mail and making it a crime for third parties to give food or water to voters waiting in line.\u00a0 ##Other Races##\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez will defeat Republican Rep. Mayra Flores in a rare member-against-member House race in the Texas 34th District, CNN projects. His win offers evidence that Democrats have had some success stemming their losses among Latino voters in the Rio Grande Valley, who shifted in the GOP\u2019s favor in 2020. ##House## Democrat Nikki Budzinski will win in Illinois\u2019 13th District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Republican Thomas Kean Jr. will win in New Jersey\u2019s 7th District, CNN projects, and defeat Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski. ##House## Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont will win reelection in Connecticut, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Bob Stefanowski.\u00a0 Lamont defeated Stefanowski in 2018 by just about 3 percentage points.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will win reelection in New Mexico, CNN projects, overcoming a stronger-than-expected challenge from Republican Mark Ronchetti. Lujan Grisham\u2019s win makes her the fourth straight New Mexico governor to win reelection and will likely grow her national profile -- the Democrat received some vice-presidential consideration by President Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential general election.\u00a0 Lujan Grisham centered her campaign on abortion, casting her opponent as extreme on the issue that motivated Democratic campaigns across the country. She also nationalized the race -- both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the state in the final weeks of the campaign.\u00a0 The reason for that: The last four Democratic presidential nominees carried the state, including Biden by 11 percentage points two years ago.\u00a0 Ronchetti, a former TV weatherman, tried to turn Lujan Grisham into an avatar for Democratic control in Washington and attacked her as a career politician.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe can be a state that looks out for you before it looks out for government, but you have to give us a chance at change,\u201d he said at the final debate between the two candidates.\u00a0 But Lujan Grisham successfully convinced voters that Ronchetti was not the person to be the change.\u00a0 \u201cBad for New Mexicans, bad for New Mexico,\u201d she said of Ronchetti during the debate.\u00a0 ##Governor## Rep. Henry Cuellar, the lone House Democrat who has voted against abortion rights, will win reelection in Texas\u2019 28th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0 Cuellar will defeat Republican challenger Cassy Garcia, halting the GOP\u2019s efforts to sweep a trio of Rio Grande Valley districts as the party makes gains among Latino voters.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating her GOP opponent in the midterm race. Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, won out against longshot Republican challenger John Dennis in the race for California\u2019s 11th Congressional District. Over the years, Pelosi, 82, has become one of the most prominent faces of the Democratic Party. As speaker, she has earned a reputation as a powerful and formidable leader to House Democrats who exerts significant influence and a tight grip over members of her caucus.\u00a0\u00a0 Pelosi has also been a fierce adversary to Republicans and has become a highly polarizing figure in Washington as a result.\u00a0\u00a0 Speculation over Pelosi\u2019s future atop the House Democratic caucus has intensified as the midterms approached and Republicans fought to regain the House majority.\u00a0\u00a0 CNN reported in September that in interviews with more than two dozen House Democrats, a consensus began to emerge: If they lose the majority, there would be overwhelming pressure for Pelosi to go, a prospect that Democratic sources said the powerful House speaker is keenly aware of.\u00a0 At the same time, multiple members said they were also starting to see how, if Democrats do hold control, it could lead to Pelosi extending her time in power. Yet Democrats are split about that possibility, with a sizable contingent eager for new leadership regardless of the outcome, even if she\u2019d be the heavy favorite to hold onto the gavel.\u00a0 ##House## Democrat Sharice Davids will win in Kansas\u2019 3rd District, CNN projects.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Republican Andy Ogles will win the House seat in Tennessee\u2019s 5th District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democrat Seth Magaziner will win in Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes has defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a closely watched open race for Ohio\u2019s 13th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0\u00a0 Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, CNN projects, ousting the Cincinnati-area congressman after redistricting made Ohio\u2019s 1st Congressional District stronger terrain for Democrats. Landsman, a Cincinnati city councilmember, was a rare example of a Democratic candidate on offense in a midterm election cycle during which the party was largely focused on defending its House seats. ##House## It's midnight on the East Coast and we are down to eight Senate seats still to be decided \u2014 and it is dead even between Democrats and Republicans. The race to control the Senate currently stands at \u2014 46 seats for Democrats, 46 for Republicans. Here are more of the latest Election night headlines: Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance will win Ohio Senate race: Republican J.D. Vance will win the Ohio Senate race, CNN projects, outlasting a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan and keeping the seat under GOP control.\u00a0Vance\u2019s win is a boon for Republicans and a victory for former President Donald Trump, whose endorsement in the Republican primary helped Vance emerge from the contentious intraparty fight.\u00a0\nDemocrat Josh Shapiro will win Pennsylvania governorship: Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro will be the next governor of Pennsylvania, CNN projects, defeating far-right Republican state lawmaker Doug Mastriano.\u00a0Shapiro\u2019s ascent means Democrats will keep control of the state\u2019s top job, providing a powerful check on its GOP-held state legislature, as Gov. Tom Wolf leaves office due to term limits. Shapiro is also now poised to become a leading national Democratic figure short-listed for the party\u2019s next open presidential primary.\u00a0\nIncumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Stacey Abrams in Georgia governor race: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will be reelected in Georgia, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for a second time.\u00a0Abrams has called Kemp to concede, according to a Kemp campaign source. Kemp had been seen as the favorite in the race for months, with Abrams unable to capture the momentum she experienced in 2018 and hampered by broader voter discontent with Democratic control of Washington.\u00a0\nNew Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win reelection bid: Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win her bid for reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican Don Bolduc and delivering her party a key win in its bid to keep the Senate in Democratic control. Hassan was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country at the start of the year, saddled with lagging economic indicators and President Joe Biden\u2019s sluggish approval rating.\u00a0\u00a0\nWes Moore makes history in Maryland: CNN projects that Wes Moore will become the first Black governor in Maryland\u2019s history, defeating Republican state Delegate Dan Cox. Moore will be just the third Black American to be elected governor of a US state. Virginia\u2019s Douglas Wilder was the first in 1989, and Massachusetts\u2019 Deval Patrick was the second in 2006. Here's what the House and Senate look like at 11:30 p.m. ET, according to CNN's projections: House: Senate: ##Catch Up## It\u2019s midnight ET, and the polls are closing in Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0 Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz is running for his second full term \u2014 he was appointed to the Senate in 2012 and won a special election in 2014 before winning a full term in 2016. Hawaii is one of the bluest states in the country, giving Schatz a huge boost in his bid against GOP state Rep. Bob McDermott.\u00a0\u00a0 Hawaii has only elected two Republican governors in its history (Linda Lingle and William Francis Quinn), and it\u2019s unlikely that will change this year. Hawaii voters will choose between Democratic Lt. Gov. Josh Green and Republican former Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona.\u00a0\u00a0 Green became a household name to Hawaii voters during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to being a doctor who worked as a physician during his time in the state legislature and as lieutenant governor, Green served as the administration's health liaison between the state and the health care community during the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 Democrat Becca Balint will make history as the first woman elected to Congress from Vermont, with CNN projecting she will defeat GOP nominee Liam Madden for the state\u2019s at-large House seat.\u00a0\u00a0 Vermont had been the last remaining state in the country not to have elected a woman to Congress.\u00a0 With her win, Balint will also become the first out LGBTQ person elected to Congress from the Green Mountain State. She previously made history in the Vermont Senate, where she was the first woman to serve as president pro tempore.\u00a0 The state\u2019s lone House seat opened up after Welch, who was first elected to the House in 2007, announced a bid late last year for the seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. The retiring senator was first elected in 1974 and is the longest-serving senator still in office and the third-longest-serving senator in Senate history.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democratic Gov. Tim Walz will win reelection in Minnesota, CNN projects, and defeat physician and former state Sen. Scott Jensen.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul will win a first full term in office, CNN projects, defeating Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin in what developed into a surprisingly tense race in its final weeks. Hochul\u2019s victory keeps New York Democrats on track to maintain their now nearly two-decade-old winning streak in statewide elections. A Buffalo native, Hochul took over the top job in August 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo, the three-term governor who faced impeachment amid a sexual harassment scandal. Despite being his lieutenant governor, Hochul and Cuomo were never closely aligned and she moved quickly upon taking office to clear it of his allies.\u00a0 Already the first woman to hold the governor\u2019s office in New York, Hochul will now become the first to win it in an election. Zeldin, a conservative acolyte of former President Donald Trump, ran a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign almost entirely focused on fears over rising crime and a 2019 criminal justice reform law that made it more difficult for judges to hold suspects in pre-trial detention. But he also tapped into frustration over the state of the economy, which has been slow to recover in and around New York City following the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and working class concerns over environmental initiatives like a plan to hike fees for automobiles entering heavily trafficked parts of the city.\u00a0 Hochul, who in the latter part of the campaign dialed up her political outreach in New York City, where Democrats typically need about 70% of the vote to assure statewide victory, hammered Zeldin throughout the race over his anti-abortion positions and vote in Congress against certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s election.\u00a0 Like other blue state Republicans, Zeldin repeatedly insisted he had no plans to change abortion law in New York, where Democrats \u2013 both before and after the leak of the Supreme Court opinion striking down Roe was published \u2013 have passed a suite of comprehensive protections for patients and abortion providers.\u00a0 But Zeldin undermined his promise with comments to an anti-abortion group suggesting he would appoint a like-minded state health commissioner, who would have significant power to shape policy. He walked those back, but in his lone debate with Hochul also hedged on whether he would back funding Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor## Incumbent Republican Ken Paxton will will reelection as Texas attorney general, CNN \t\tprojects. ##Other Races##\u00a0 Incumbent Democrat Letitia James will win her reelection bid in New York\u2019s attorney general race, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Other Races##\u00a0\u00a0 In her concession speech, Democrat Stacey Abrams began her remarks by thanking Georgia and congratulating incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp on winning the race.  \u201cIt is good to be here in this moment surrounded by your love and support. And let me begin by offering congratulations to Gov. Brian Kemp,\" Abrams said.  She added, \"Look, I got into this race for one reason and one reason only,  to fight. And not just any fight, a fight to save Georgia. A fight on behalf of our children and generations to come. A fight on behalf of our people, whether they know it or not. A fight for basic human rights that we should take for granted, but we have to struggle to hold onto. And a fight for the values that we hold dear and we may never sacrifice. I got into this for a fight that we know to be true deep down in our bones, that the state of Georgia, that the people of Georgia deserve more.\"  Abrams thanked her supporters including those who have been with her since she first ran for office in 2006 and said that her obligation to continue to fight for Georgia remains resolute.  \"I see in this crowd women and men who have been a part of this journey since I put my name on a ballot in 2006 and while I may not have crossed the finish line that does not mean we will ever stop running for a better Georgia. We will never stop running for the truth that we know to be true. For the people we know need to see us. For the ones who don\u2019t know they deserve to stand let alone run. And tonight, we must be honest even though my fight, our fight for the governor\u2019s mansion might\u2019ve come up short, I\u2019m pretty tall,\" she said.  Abrams continued, \" And I \u2014 I am here because a moment where despite every obstacle we are still standing strong and standing tall and standing resolute and standing in our values. And we know Georgia deserves more, and whether we do it from the governor\u2019s mansion, or from the streets, whether we do it from the capitol or from our communities, we\u2019re going to fight for more for the state of Georgia.\"  ##Governor## Republican J.D. Vance, the projected winner of Ohio\u2019s open Senate seat, said he was \u201coverwhelmed with gratitude\u201d during his victory speech to supporters in Columbus Tuesday. He thanked his family and campaign team as well as the Republican Party and officials who joined him on the campaign trail. \u201cWe just got a great chance to govern and we need to use it,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe need better leadership in Washington, DC, and that\u2019s exactly what I promise to fight for every single day,\u201d he added. Some background: Vance\u2019s win is a boon for Republicans and a victory for former President Donald Trump, whose endorsement in the Republican primary helped Vance emerge from the contentious intraparty fight. Vance continues a long line of Republican victories in a state that has tilted toward the party in recent years. Other than Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, no Democrat has won nonjudicial statewide office in the state since 2008 and former President Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state in 2012. ##Senate## House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has won reelection, CNN projects. McCarthy defeated longshot Democratic challenger Marisa Wood in the midterm race for California\u2019s 20th Congressional District.\u00a0\u00a0 If Republicans win back the House majority, McCarthy is widely expected to be elected as the next House Speaker at the start of the new session of Congress, which would further elevate his position as a prominent leader in the national Republican Party and usher in a new era in Washington with Republicans set to pursue aggressive oversight of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\u00a0\u00a0 As the top House Republican, McCarthy faces the challenge of having to balance the interests and priorities of different ideological factions within the House GOP conference, ranging from the far-right to more moderate members representing swing districts.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley wins reelection in Massachusetts 7th Congressional District, CNN projects. ##House## Republican Katie Britt will be the first female senator elected in Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.\u00a0\u00a0 Britt is just one of the projected winners who made history on Tuesday night. Here are a few others: ##Catch Up## Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 the third-ranking House Republican \u2014 will win her reelection in New York\u2019s 21st District, CNN projects. ##House## As polls in more western states start to close, Republicans have two more Senate seats than Democrats \u2014 needing to win four more to win control of the chamber. Republicans are projected to win 46 seats and Democrats are projected to win 44, with many more states still counting ballots, but the window of opportunity could be getting smaller for Democrats, CNN\u2019s John King said in analysis. \u201cWe are in a very narrow chess game for control of the Senate right now, and we have fewer pieces in place,\u201d he said Tuesday. There are a handful of key states with results will coming that could determine who controls the chamber \u2014 Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada, King said. Watch: ##Senate## ##Catch Up## Democratic Sen. Patty Murray will win reelection in Washington state, CNN projects, and will defeat Republican Tiffany Smiley. ##Senate## Four-term Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden will win reelection in Oregon, CNN projects, and will defeat Republican Jo Rae Perkins. ##Senate## Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur has won reelection in Ohio\u2019s 9th Congressional District, CNN projects, holding onto a seat she has represented since 1983. Headed into the 2022 midterms, Kaptur was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable House Democrats in the country, with both Ohio and her district, in part because of redistricting, moving away from her party politically.\u00a0 But after Republican J.R. Majewski unexpectedly defeated better-funded and more establishment-aligned Republicans in the primary, the race began to tilt toward Kaptur given Majewski\u2019s unflinching loyalty to former President Donald Trump, the fact he was a January 6, 2021, rally participant and has repeatedly shared pro-QAnon material, despite denying he followed the conspiracy theory movement.\u00a0 Kaptur effectively won the race in September after the National Republican Congressional Committee cancelled all their ad reservations in the district. The decision came just days after The Associated Press reported Majewski had misrepresented his military service.\u00a0 Kaptur\u2019s win is a boon for Democrats. Kaptur\u2019s district shifted dramatically during Ohio\u2019s controversial redistricting process, moving from a solidly Democratic seat to one that leans toward Republicans.\u00a0 Kaptur ran on her ties to Ohio, arguing that being a Midwestern Democrat in a party increasingly run with big-city sensibilities on both coasts is a growing challenge for her.\u00a0 \u201cWhat coastal people, God bless them, don\u2019t understand, is that we lost our middle class,\u201d Kaptur told CNN. \u201cWe lost so many people who\u2019ve worked hard all their lives, including in many of these small towns. I understand that. We feel their pain. We went through it together.\u201d\u00a0 ##House## Two-term Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal will win reelection in Connecticut, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Leora Levy, a Trump-endorsed candidate who won her primary against a moderate Republican backed by the state\u2019s Republican Party.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Republican Rep. Ted Budd will be the next senator from North Carolina, CNN projects, defeating former state Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley in a race that had tilted toward the GOP for months. Budd\u2019s win keeps the seat in Republican hands after Sen. Richard Burr announced he would not seek reelection and -- with an evenly divided Senate -- helps Republicans on their mission to take back the legislative chamber in January.\u00a0 Democrats long viewed the North Carolina Senate race as a reach for the party. They would have liked to have won it of course, but the race attracted far less outside spending than contests in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 the states widely seen as the top two chances for Democrats to flip a Senate seat in 2022.\u00a0 Budd, aided by an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, won the GOP nomination in May. Unlike Beasley, the three-term congressman trod a familiar political path -- going from owning a family business to winning a seat in the US House of Representatives to seeking statewide office.\u00a0 Headed into Election Day, Republican and Democratic operatives saw the race as tight, with increased polarization leading to an ever-shrinking sliver of persuadable voters across the state.\u00a0 In the end, however, North Carolina\u2019s recent political tilt aided Budd. Trump won the state twice and Democrats haven\u2019t won a Senate seat in the state since 2008.\u00a0 Budd, like Republicans across the country, hammered Beasley on inflation, crime and ties to President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\u00a0 \u201cWe talked a lot about tonight about Joe Biden,\u201d Budd said in his closing statement of a debate in October. \u201cWhy am I doing that? Because Joe Biden is on the ballot on November 8, and he goes by the name this year of Cheri Beasley.\u201d\u00a0 ##Senate## Republican J.D. Vance will win the Ohio Senate race, CNN projects, outlasting a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan and keeping the seat under GOP control.\u00a0 Vance\u2019s win is a boon for Republicans and a victory for former President Donald Trump, whose endorsement in the Republican primary helped Vance emerge from the contentious intraparty fight.\u00a0 Vance continues a long line of Republican victories in a state that has tilted towards the party in recent years. Other than Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, no Democrat has won nonjudicial statewide office in the state since 2008 and former President Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state in 2012.\u00a0 The race between Vance and Ryan was a contentious and, at times, personal affair, with both candidates holding a clear animosity towards the other.\u00a0\u00a0 Ryan\u2019s stout challenge to Vance worried Republicans in Ohio and Washington, D.C. That contributed to the acrimony, a feeling that played out on the campaign trail and during their two debates, both of which devolved into Vance and Ryan trading personal barbs.\u00a0 \u201cThese leaders in DC will eat you up like a chew toy,\u201d Ryan said of Vance\u2019s support for Trump, even after the former president publicly accused him of \u201ckissing my ass\u201d to get him to campaign for him. \u201cI am just telling you, like, I have been in this business, it is tough business. If you think you are going to help Ohio, you are not. If you can\u2019t even stand up for yourself, how are you going to stand up for the people of this state?\u201d\u00a0 And Vance repeatedly questioned Ryan\u2019s character. \u201cTim Ryan has put on a costume where he pretends to be reasonable moderate,\u201d the Republican said during their first debate.\u00a0 Money loomed large in the race, with Ryan consistently enjoying a significant fundraising advantage over Vance.\u00a0 In the third quarter of 2022, Ryan raised a sizable $17.2 million, compared to Vance\u2019s $6.9 million. In the second quarter, the gap was even more dramatic: Ryan raised $9.1 million to Vance\u2019s roughly $1 million.\u00a0 Still, because of Democratic skepticism about their chances in Ohio, Ryan had to largely go it alone in the state, pouring all the money he raised into a slate of television ads. Vance, by contrast, received considerable outside help \u2013 including from the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund, which announced in August it planned to spend at least $28 million in the state.\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Election results are still coming in, and many races won\u2019t be called for days, if not weeks. But for now, here\u2019s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pledged to do more to secure the border and congratulated other Republicans who are projected to win Tuesday. \u201cI ran for the farmers and ranchers down here on the border who pleaded for a more secure border in the state of Texas,\u201d he said, adding that he will also continue to fight crime and \u201ckeep Texas number 1 in oil and gas\u201d production in the US. Abbott, who CNN projects will win reelection, said he will urge lawmakers to reinstate the  Remain in Mexico policy and re-start building the border wall. He thanked Texans who voted for him, assuring the crowd, \"we will go to work every single day to earn that trust.\" \u201cAll of you inspired me and all of your propelled me\u201d to reelection, the governor added, saying he heard from voters that they just want to \u201ckeep Texas, Texas.\u201d \"Together we will keep Texas the greatest state, in the greatest country, in the history of the world,\" Abbott added. He touted other successes, including the quality of education, and funding law enforcement. The governor also congratulated \u201cthe next generation of Republicans\u201d who were elected tonight. ##Governor## Harriet Hageman, a Donald Trump ally who ousted Rep. Liz Cheney in August\u2019s Republican primary, will win Wyoming\u2019s at-large House seat, CNN projects. Hageman defeated Democrat Lynnette Grey Bull, as well as contenders from the Libertarian and Constitution parties. Her victory in the deep red state \u2014 Trump won Wyoming by 43 percentage points in 2020 \u2014 was all but guaranteed after she defeated Cheney in one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched primaries. ##House## Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro will be the next governor of Pennsylvania, CNN projects, defeating far-right Republican state lawmaker Doug Mastriano.\u00a0 Shapiro\u2019s ascent means Democrats will keep control of the state\u2019s top job, providing a powerful check on its GOP-held state legislature, as Gov. Tom Wolf leaves office due to term limits. Shapiro is also now poised to become a leading national Democratic figure short-listed for the party\u2019s next open presidential primary.\u00a0 Most polling of the race before Election Day showed Shapiro with a comfortable lead over Mastriano, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump shortly before the primary and chartered buses to Washington ahead of the former President\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021. (Mastriano says he never entered the US Capitol and has not been charged with any crimes.)\u00a0 But the Republican nominee\u2019s support for expanded gun rights, strict anti-abortion laws and outspoken opposition to Covid-19 safety measures appeared to alienate voters in Pennsylvania\u2019s decisive swing counties. \u00a0 Mastriano, a retired army colonel, was outpaced by Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz in polling throughout the general election season and Oz often made pains to distance himself from his fellow GOP nominee.\u00a0 Entering this campaign, Shapiro, who also outraised Mastriano by tens of millions of dollars, held the record for most votes won by a candidate in state history. In 2020, his 3.46 million ballots outpaced even Joe Biden, who ended up with roughly 3,000 fewer votes.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will be reelected in Georgia, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for a second time.\u00a0 Abrams has called Kemp to concede, according to a Kemp campaign source. Kemp had been seen as the favorite in the race for months, with Abrams unable to capture the momentum she experienced in 2018 and hampered by broader voter discontent with Democratic control of Washington.\u00a0 The victory reasserts Republican control of the executive office in Georgia just two years removed from Democrats winning both of the state\u2019s US Senate seats and President Joe Biden becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.\u00a0 Abrams\u2019 defeat is a tough blow for Democrats who have long sought to elevate her in a state that, until recently, had been dominated by Republicans. After losing to Kemp by less than two\u00a0percentage points in 2018, Abrams was among the women considered to run alongside Biden. She is often touted as one of the most influential Democrats in the country, despite currently holding no public office.\u00a0\u00a0 Kemp\u2019s victory is a clear sign that economic arguments made by Republicans were more powerful in 2022 than Democrats\u2019 focus on abortion. Abrams centered her campaign on the issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over the summer. She told CNN in September that the issue was going to be \u201cfront and center in the conversation\u201d -- specifically Kemp\u2019s signing of a bill that bans most abortions when early cardiac activity is detected, when many women don\u2019t yet know they\u2019re pregnant.\u00a0 Kemp said on the campaign trail that he stood by that law, noting that it provided some exceptions. He instead spent much of his time focused on inflation, crime, and antipathy for Biden\u2019s administration.\u00a0 \u201cGeorgians should know that my desire is to continue to help them fight through 40-year high inflation and high gas prices and other things that our Georgia families are facing right now, quite honestly, because of bad policies in Washington, DC, from President Biden and the Democrats that have complete control,\u201d Kemp said at his first debate against Abrams.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0\u00a0 Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win her bid for reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican Don Bolduc and delivering her party a key win in its bid to keep the Senate in Democratic control. Hassan was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country at the start of the year, saddled with lagging economic indicators and President Joe Biden\u2019s sluggish approval rating.\u00a0\u00a0 But the Democratic senator -- aided by Bolduc being viewed by top Republicans in Washington and New Hampshire as out of step with the Granite State -- was successful in her bid for six more years in office after winning her first term by roughly a thousand votes out of more than 700,000 cast.\u00a0 Bolduc was widely written off by local and national Republicans, many of whom viewed him with skepticism as he rose during the primary and had grave concerns about his inability to raise money. After staking far-right positions on a range of topics to defeat a series of better funded Republican candidates, Bolduc attempted to walk back those positions almost as soon as he won the primary, including repeatedly pushing falsehoods around the validity of the 2020 election.\u00a0\u00a0 Even with their doubts, though,\u00a0Republicans spent more than $34 million on ads between Labor Day and Election Day pushing Bolduc, a sign of how vulnerable the party saw Hassan.\u00a0 Hassan\u2019s successful attacks on Bolduc -- and the Republican\u2019s less than clear pushback -- did little to assuage Republican concerns, leading the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senate Leadership Fund to cut their planned spending in the state weeks before Election Day. The National Republican Senatorial Committee returned two weeks out with a small $1 million buy.\u00a0 Like many Democrats across the country, Hassan was powered by energy around the abortion debate and used former President Donald Trump and the unfounded denial rhetoric around the 2020 election to cast Bolduc as an extremist.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear here: Don Bolduc is an election denier,\u201d she said at a debate. \u201cHis refusal to accept election results means he doesn\u2019t listen to you. This allows him to support an agenda that will raise your costs and eviscerate your rights, because at the end of the day, he doesn\u2019t think he needs to listen, or isn\u2019t accountable to you.\u201d\u00a0 ##Senate## Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar wins reelection bid in Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District race, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Sen. Tammy Duckworth will win reelection in Illinois, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Kathy Salvi. When she was elected in 2016, Duckworth became the first disabled female senator. She was flying a helicopter in Iraq in 2004 when it was attacked and she lost both of her legs, and in 2018 she became the first senator to give birth while in office. ##Senate## Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker will win reelection in Illinois, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Republican Gov. Brad Little will win reelection in Idaho, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Stephen Heidt.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Democratic incumbent Gavin Newsom will win another term as California's governor, CNN projects, a year after he faced a recall election. He defeated Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle.\u00a0 The recall effort against Newsom gained momentum over the governor\u2019s strict Covid-19 restrictions, especially when he was seen as not following them himself. In California, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one, giving Democratic candidates a huge advantage in statewide races.\u00a0 The last Republican governor of the Golden State was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011.\u00a0 ##Other Races##\u00a0 Longtime GOP Sen. Mike Crapo will win reelection in Idaho, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat David Roth. ##Senate## Democratic Gov. Janet Mills won a second term in office, CNN projected, defeating her predecessor, former Gov. Paul LePage, a right-wing Republican seeking to win back his old job after being forced out in 2019 due to state term limits.\u00a0 Mills became the state\u2019s first female governor when she defeated Republican Shawn Moody in 2018, setting a record for the most votes received by any gubernatorial candidate in state history.\u00a0\u00a0 Her defeat of LePage, an outspoken conservative who has described himself as \u201cTrump before there was Trump,\u201d is a rebuke to the former President\u2019s political movement and a boon for Democrats, who entered the night defending 20 of the 36 contested governor\u2019s offices nationwide.\u00a0 LePage not only made false claims about voter fraud in 2020, but has a history of alleging stolen elections, something he denied in a debate despite publicly available evidence to the contrary. The Republican\u2019s campaign also attacked Mills over Covid-19 restrictions and the struggles of the state\u2019s seafood industry, but Mills pushed back, touting her efforts to backstop it by, among other measures, sending federal relief cash to reimburse licensing fees paid up and down the supply chain.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla will win election in California, CNN projects, becoming the first elected Latino senator in state history. \u00a0 California Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Padilla , the son of Mexican immigrant parents, to the seat that Kamala Harris vacated to become vice president in January 2021. \u00a0 Padilla will defeat Republican Mark Meuser in both a regular election for a six-year term as well as a special election for the remainder of Harris\u2019 term that ends in January. \u00a0 Padilla and Meuser advanced to the general election after finishing in the top two in June in the state\u2019s open primary, which sees candidates of all parties running on the same ballot with the top two moving on to November. \u00a0 Prior to his appointment to the Senate, Padilla was elected to two terms as California secretary of state. He entered politics as an aide to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, now his fellow Democratic colleague in the Senate. \u00a0 He was elected to the Los Angeles City Council at 26 in 1999, later becoming the council\u2019s youngest president in its history. In 2006, he was elected to the state Senate, representing the San Fernando Valley.\u00a0 In Congress, Padilla has been vocal on transportation and immigration policies. He chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety.\u00a0 ##Senate## It\u2019s 11 p.m. and polls are closing in four states:\u00a0\u00a0 California\u00a0\u00a0\nIdaho\u00a0\u00a0\nOregon\u00a0\u00a0\nWashington\u00a0\u00a0 See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here.\u00a0 CNN projects that Wes Moore will become the first Black governor in Maryland\u2019s history, defeating Republican state Delegate Dan Cox. Moore will be just the third Black American to be elected governor of a US state. Virginia\u2019s Douglas Wilder was the first in 1989, and Massachusetts\u2019 Deval Patrick was the second in 2006. Here\u2019s a look at how Moore spent his Election Day: ##Catch Up## Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt will win an open Senate seat against Democrat Trudy Busch Valentine, CNN projects, ending one of the strangest races this election cycle, even if the final result was unsurprising.\u00a0\u00a0 For months, Republicans from Washington to Missouri were concerned that former Gov. Eric Greitens would win the Senate Republican primary race, even though he resigned in disgrace in 2018, worrying that he would emerge from a large field of candidates desperately trying to win former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement.\u00a0\u00a0 In February, Schmitt declined to answer CNN\u2019s question on whether the 2020. election was stolen, while standing by his decision to sign onto a 2020 Texas lawsuit to invalidate the results of swing states Trump lost, which was rejected by the Supreme Court. Other candidates, including Greitens, overtly sided with Trump.\u00a0\u00a0 In June, John Wood, a former senior investigator for the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, launched an independent campaign with the backing of former Missouri GOP Sen. John Danforth. Then, a day before the August primary, Trump endorsed \u201cERIC,\u201d urging voters to choose either Schmitt or Greitens.\u00a0 After getting pummeled on the air by the Senate Leadership Fund, the Mitch McConnell-aligned Super PAC, Greitens took third place, behind Rep. Vicky Hartzler and Schmitt.\u00a0\u00a0 The general election without the scandal-ridden Greitens was comparatively conventional. After Schmitt won, Wood dropped out, removing the chance of a spoiler in a state that had not sent a Missouri Democrat to the Senate in a decade.\u00a0\u00a0 Like Republicans across the country, Schmitt ran against the Biden administration, rising costs and crime. Valentine, an Anheuser-Busch heir who loaned over $10 million to her campaign, attacked him for banning abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, immediately after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\u00a0 The race also turned personal. Valentine\u2019s campaign essentially said that Schmitt sold out Missouri farmers to China. And Schmitt attacked Valentine\u2019s pedigree, as she portrayed herself as a mother of six and former nurse, whose husband died of cancer and whose oldest son died after battling opioid addiction.\u00a0 In one ad, Schmitt said he learned the value of hard work from his blue-collar grandfather and father. He said in college, he gave tours and took out the trash \u201cat the estate Trudy Busch Valentine grew up on.\u201d In another, Schmitt said Valentine \u201ccomes from billions and doesn't care about what inflation is doing to your wallet.\u201d\u00a0 ##Senate## Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley will win reelection in Iowa, CNN projects, fending off his toughest challenge since he first won the seat in 1980.\u00a0\u00a0 Grassley defeated Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral who campaigned with low expectations and little national Democratic support in the increasingly red state.\u00a0\u00a0 Grassley, 89, is set to become the longest-serving current senator in January, replacing Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is retiring. He would be 95 at the end of the eighth six-year term he won Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Republican Sen. John Kennedy will win reelection in Louisiana, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, who CNN projects will win reelection, thanked voters and said he feels he won this race by listening to the \u201cstruggles of the working people in this economy.\u201d \"We won this campaign because we told the truth from the beginning to the end of this election. We said the same things in red parts of the state and blue parts of the state and our primary and our general election, we told the truth,\" Bennet said, addressing a crowd at his watch party Tuesday. He said he will continue to focus on the economy in Washington, DC, saying that it has worked for the top percentage of earners, but \u201chasn\u2019t worked for anybody else.\u201d He said it is a result of policies made on Capitol Hill for the last 40 years that prioritizes people who \u201cwant to make stuff as cheaply as possible,\u201d namely in China, instead of investing in US supply chains or trying to fix wages and income inequality. Bennet touted bills that he has supported during his time in Congress, such as capping drug prices and passing a climate and energy bill to reduce costs \u2014\u00a0but said there is still more to do.\u00a0 Bennet said his Republican challenger Joe O\u2019Dea called him to concede and congratulate him on his victory, adding that his opponent said during the call, \u201c\u2018I hope you do what\u2019s right for the state of Colorado\u2019 and I said, \u2018that\u2019s all I want to do\u2019 and we agreed to stay in touch.\" \u201cI appreciate the fact that he stepped up and ran for office, it\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d Bennet said of O\u2019Dea. ##Senate## Republican Gov. Mark Gordon will win reelection in Wyoming, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Theresa Livingston. ##Governor## Republican Jim Pillen will win Nebraska\u2019s gubernatorial race, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Carol Blood. ##Governor## Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds will win reelection in Iowa, CNN projects.\u00a0 Reynolds became Iowa\u2019s first female governor in 2017 when former GOP Gov. Terry \tBranstad became the US ambassador to China in former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. She won her first full term in 2018 by less than 37,000 votes.\u00a0\u00a0 While the Hawkeye State has traditionally been a highly competitive state, it has drifted \ttoward Republicans in recent years.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has won a third term, CNN projects, fending off former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke in a match-up in which Democrats had hoped to challenge Republicans\u2019 decades of dominance in Austin.\u00a0\u00a0 Abbott, who is viewed by some within the GOP as a potential 2024 presidential contender, survived O\u2019Rourke\u2019s criticism of his management of the state\u2019s power grid, his response to mass shootings, including the one at an elementary school in Uvalde, and his opposition to abortion rights.\u00a0\u00a0 The victory by Abbott underscores the extent to which Republicans remain dominant in Texas \u2014 buoyed in part by improved performances with Latino voters.\u00a0\u00a0 Democrats have long hoped that the growing and increasingly diverse urban centers and suburbs of Texas would provide the party a path to competitiveness in the largest red state on America\u2019s political map.\u00a0\u00a0 O\u2019Rourke got close in his 2018 Senate race against Republican Ted Cruz to becoming the first Democrat elected statewide in Texas since 1994. But polls this year showed him lagging farther behind Abbott as Republicans hammered Democrats across the nation over rising inflation and gas prices.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 President Joe Biden\u2019s advisers are closely monitoring the election returns as they continue to come in \u2014 and as of 10 p.m. on election night, they believe they are seeing a highly competitive landscape across the board.\u00a0 For the time being \u2014 with the important caveat that it\u2019s still early and many races haven\u2019t been called \u2014 Biden advisers feel that things are likely not headed towards a blowout that some had predicted heading into this week, particularly as they take stock of competitive House and gubernatorial that have already been called in their favor. Biden has been making calls from the dining room off the Oval Office, according to a source familiar, and has called a number of Democrats tonight. He was also watching returns from his residence and stopped by to visit some of his staff watching from the Roosevelt Room. Wes Moore, the projected winner in Maryland's governor race, told supporters \"our time is now\" during his victory speech.  Moore will be the first Black governor of the state and\u00a0just the third Black American to be elected governor in US history.  Moore touted the diversity of his supporters and thanked them for their votes.  \"It was your support, it was your sense of purpose that carried us across this state. All 24 jurisdictions from the western mountains to the eastern shore. From my birth place of Montgomery County to the adopted, to my adopted home of Baltimore City \u2014 Hey Baltimore. And everywhere in between,\" he said.  He continued, \"And the thing is, when I look across this room tonight, what we see right here is we see Maryland, right? We see people from all backgrounds, from all walks of life, from all income levels. We see teachers, we see small business owners, we see nurses, we see union members. All of you who\u2019ve leant your voices and also gave your votes to this campaign and you said the same thing. Who all said with a collective voice that, \u201cOur time is now.\u201d Moore also thanked his running mate Aruna Miller for her support. Miller immigrated with her family from India as a child and made history tonight becoming Maryland\u2019s first Asian American lieutenant governor-elect.\u00a0\u201cIt has been an absolute honor to go on this journey with you my friend,\u201d he said. ##Governor##  Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman will win reelection in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib will win reelection in Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who CNN projects will win a second term in office, appeared at his election night party in Tampa and thanked his supporters for \u201chonoring us with a win for the ages.\u201d\u00a0 DeSantis, a Republican, was joined on stage by his wife, Casey, and their three children. Here\u2019s what the scene looked like at the Tampa Convention Center: ##Catch Up## US stocks were up in after-hours trading as results from Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections started rolling in. Investors\u00a0have been betting\u00a0on a big Republican wave in the elections. If Republicans take at least one chamber of Congress, that will likely result in more gridlock, which the market usually loves. Investors are more than happy when politicians bicker but don\u2019t actually enact any new laws that may hurt corporate profits. Dow\u00a0futures were up 16 points, or about 0.1%.\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0futures were up 0.2%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq Composite\u00a0was up 0.4%. Early results on election night can be\u00a0very different\u00a0from the final outcome once all the votes are tallied. That process can take days. \u201cIf Republicans do well and take back control of one or both chambers of Congress, we see the event as a positive for the stock market into year-end,\u201d Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cBut if Republicans only take back control of the House, and not the Senate, we suspect the gains in the S&P 500 may be modest.\u201d Since 1948, the S&P 500 has had an annualized return of 16.9% during the nine years when a Democrat was in the White House and Republicans had a majority in both chambers of Congress, according to Edelman Financial Engines. That compares to 15.1% during periods of full Democratic control and 15.9% in years when there was a unified GOP government. But at the end of the day, political headlines are often just noise for the markets. Ameriprise chief market strategist Anthony Saglimbene said on a conference call last week about the midterms that stocks have historically gone up after elections, no matter which party controls the White House and Congress. Saglimbene noted that \u201cgrowth, profits, inflation and interest rates\u201d matter more to investors over the long haul. Democrat Summer Lee will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, CNN projects, winning election to the state\u2019s 12th Congressional District.  Lee, a Pittsburgh-area state representative, will succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle. ##House## Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans will defeat Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria in Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, CNN projects, a big win for Republicans as they vie to take back control of the House.\u00a0 Luria is a member of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.  Kiggans was a top Republican recruit this cycle, taking advantage of Virginia\u2019s redistricting process which shifted Luria\u2019s district from a tough, but competitive, area for Democrats to an even steeper climb. That shift, and the prospect of Democrats losing a seat, turned the race between Luria and Kiggans into one of the closely watched contests in the nation.\u00a0 Luria ran on her role on the congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, hammering Kiggans for aligning herself with top Republicans who have diminished the attack on the Capitol, claiming it made her \u201cnot fit to serve in the United States Congress.\u201d\u00a0 Kiggans, like many Republicans across the country, used rising prices and economic woes against Luria, arguing that \u201chard-working Americans are hurting from Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous, failed economic policies. And in the 2nd Congressional District, these policies go by the name of Elaine Luria.\u201d\u00a0 Republican confidence in winning the seat grew after the 2021 gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Youngkin carried the area during the race, boosting Republican hopes of ousting the Democrat who won her first term in office in 2018.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 The Georgia Senate race remains something of a seesaw tonight, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker seeing their advantages expand and contract throughout the evening.\u00a0 But at Walker\u2019s campaign headquarters now, supporters are cheering as he narrowly took an edge over Warnock and inched closer to 50% \u2013 even as it remains entirely unclear whether the race will move to a Dec. 6 runoff. Walker aides still see plenty of reasons to be optimistic tonight, with several counties in north Georgia \u2013 deep and reliably red \u2013 among those with a share of the outstanding vote. They believe the heavy Election Day vote benefits Walker. Ralph Reed took the stage a few minutes ago and told supporters to settle in for a while longer, saying: \u201cGet ready to party but it\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d So far tonight, only one thing is clear and constant: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is outperforming Walker. Kemp and Walker may share a political party, but tonight they are holding separate campaign parties \u2013 about two blocks apart in north Atlanta.\u00a0 ##Senate## Pennsylvania\u2019s acting secretary of state, Leigh M. Chapman, said it will take \u201ca few days\u201d for the state\u2019s unofficial election results to be complete, and called on \u201cvoters, candidates and the media\u201d to be patient. \u201cElection officials in all 67 counties are well aware that the eyes of the nation are on the Keystone State tonight,\u201d Chapman said at a news conference in the state capital, Harrisburg. \u201cAnd they are counting as fast as they can. But they are also prioritizing accuracy over speed, as they should.\u201d Chapman, a Democrat, cited \u201ca handful of typical election day incidents,\u201d including a few polling places opening late, power outages and a gas leak. But she said that \u201call were quickly handled.\u201d \u201cIn a very dynamic environment, Pennsylvania once again executed a free, fair and secure election,\u201d Chapman said. \u00a0##Voting## House Minority Whip Steve Scalise will win reelection in Louisiana's 1st Congressional District, CNN projects. ##House## Republican Rich McCormick will defeat Democrat Bob Christian in the House race for Georgia\u2019s 6th District, CNN projects. ##House## Rep. Abigail Spanberger will win reelection in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, CNN projects, a significant win in the Democratic Party\u2019s bid to stem their losses in the 2022 midterms. Spanberger will defeat Republican Yesli Vega, a Prince William County supervisor who Democrats spent millions to define as too extreme on abortion. The strategy, which seized on the momentum felt in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June and Vega\u2019s conservative views on the issue, worked for Democrats, who banked on the issue being critical to swing suburban voters in the district. Spanberger, who was first elected to the House in 2018, was seen as a top target for Republicans, who got a boost when Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 gubernatorial election in Virginia. Youngkin carried the area that made up Virginia\u2019s 7th District, increasing Republican hopes of ousting the Democrat.\u00a0 Spanberger has now proven her ability to hold onto the once solidly red congressional seat after winning it in what was a good year for Democrats in 2018. By holding onto the seat in 2020 and 2022, Spanberger continues to be the only Democrat since 1971 to represent the district in Congress.\u00a0 ##House## As results roll in, the balance of the Senate is currently tied \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats are projected to now hold 40 seats each, with many more still with results coming in. In the races that have been called since polls have been closing, CNN projected Democrats have won in four states and Republicans have won in 10 states, including an additional special election in Oklahoma. Either party needs 50 seats to win the majority. ##Senate## ##Catch Up## Most voters in this year\u2019s election view one party positively, and the other negatively \u2013 nationally, about 4 in 10 have a favorable view of only the Democratic Party, and a similar share have a favorable view of only the Republican Party, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.  Unsurprisingly, these voters almost unanimously supported their favored party in their district\u2019s congressional election. But there\u2019s also a smaller bloc of voters \u2013 about 11% of the electorate, nationwide \u2013 who dislike both parties. This group broke in favor of the Republicans, with nearly 6 in 10 favoring a GOP House candidate this year. That\u2019s a shift from 2018, when voters who disliked both parties were about evenly split in their vote. Voters who were most upset with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade differed from those who felt less profoundly unhappy with the decision, the exit polls show. Those who were angry about the overturning of Roe (about 39% of the electorate) overwhelmingly voted Democratic for the House (about 85% picked the Democratic candidate). Those who were dissatisfied but not angry (about 21% of the electorate) narrowly favored the GOP. There was also a difference between voters who were most pessimistic about the economy, and those who felt less strongly negative. While nearly 9 in 10 voters who said the economy was poor voted for a GOP House candidate, about 6 in 10 who described the economy as \u201cnot so good\u201d backed a Democratic candidate. To some extent, these divides reflect the partisan differences already baked into views on abortion and the economy. Voters who considered themselves Democrats were roughly 59 points more than voters who considered themselves Republican to say they were angry about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Republicans, meanwhile, were about 28 points likelier than Democrats to call the economy poor. ##Analysis## Election officials for four of Wisconsin\u2019s largest cities told CNN that they\u2019re all likely to finish vote-counting within the next two hours.\u00a0 Milwaukee, the state\u2019s most populous city, expects to finish its tally of absentee ballots before 10 p.m. CT, Claire Woodall-Vogg, the Milwaukee Election Commission executive director, said at a news conference.\u00a0 That\u2019s hours earlier than during the 2020 election, when the city took until after 3 a.m. to finish counting and transmitting results to county officials. The speedier process is in part because there are only about a third as many absentee ballots for the city to count this year, as compared to 2020, Woodall-Vogg said.\u00a0 In Madison, the state\u2019s capital, results will be transmitted to the county within the next hour, City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl told CNN. Madison does not have a \u201ccentral count\u201d of absentee ballots, so both in-person and absentee ballots are counted at local polling places.\u00a0 Green Bay will likely be \u201cwrapping up\u201d its count \u201cin the next hour or two,\u201d City Clerk Celestine Jeffreys told CNN.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a lot of workers, definitely fewer absentee ballots, and we also have speeded up our process,\u201d Jeffreys said.\u00a0 And in Racine, City Clerk Tara McMenamin said in a text message that she anticipated counting will be finished close to 10 p.m. CT.\u00a0 More background: In Wisconsin\u2019s decentralized election system, municipalities tally votes and then report their results to counties, which then post the results online. So it could take additional time for counties to publicly report the results they receive.\u00a0 ##Voting##  What do Florida voters think about the possibility two Florida men could run for president in 2024? Exit polls from the Sunshine State offer some clues. With Donald Trump signaling a potential announcement next week, 33% of Florida voters said they want to see the former president run in 2024, according to the preliminary results of the Florida Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. There appears to be more of an appetite for a bid by Ron DeSantis, with 45% of Florida voters saying they want the state\u2019s governor \u2013 who CNN projects will win reelection \u2013 to seek the presidency in 2024. DeSantis\u2019 strength is reflected in the Florida exit polls, which show the governor winning Latinos in the state by 13 points. In 2020, Trump trailed Biden among Latino voters in Florida by 7 points. DeSantis also held a slight edge among independents, whom Biden carried in the state by 11 points. Those could be selling points if DeSantis and Trump collide in a 2024 GOP primary. ##Analysis## President Joe Biden made \u201ccongratulatory calls\u201d to some Democratic candidates who have won their elections Tuesday evening, the White House said.\u00a0 \u201cThis evening, the President has made congratulatory calls to Massachusetts Governor-elect Maura Healey, Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee, Senator-elect Peter Welch, Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Representative Abigail Spanberger, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer,\u201d the White House said in a statement to the press pool.\u00a0 ##Voting##\u00a0 CNN is at Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock's HQ and each time the Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker key race alert appears on the screen, loud cheers emerge from the crowd Warnock's close aides are cautiously optimistic, staying largely mum and only offering the occasional update that they are \"feeling good.\"\u00a0 But a Democratic strategist working with the campaign offered a little more from Warnock HQ, telling CNN: \"Look at DeKalb. Look at Fulton. Look at all of the majors around Atlanta. That's a huge piece.\" \"A lot of those folks who voted for Biden in 2020, are they going to stay with us,\" the strategist added, when asked what he's watching.\u00a0\"But we're seeing some of that split ticket trend I'm sure you're seeing.\"\u00a0 The optimism was couched with the recognition that it is still early, and they are waiting for information from major counties.\u00a0 Watch CNN's John King and Jake Tapper at the Magic Wall: ##Senate## Republican Gov.

Sisolak is running against Joe Lombardo, the sheriff of the state\u2019s largest county.\u00a0 Democracy is also on the ballot, as Republican\u00a0Jim Marchant, who has cast doubt on the 2020 election, seeks to run Nevada\u2019s elections as secretary of state.\u00a0 See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Priya Krishnakumar and Will Mullery contributed reporting to this post.\u00a0 Republican Gov. Phil Scott will win reelection in Vermont, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Brenda Siegel. ##Governor## \u00a0 Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma will hold off a surprisingly tough challenge from Democrat Joy Hofmeister, winning reelection in the deep-red state, CNN projects. The race was surprisingly hard-fought in a state no Democratic presidential nominee has won since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and where Republicans have held the governor\u2019s office since 2011, when Democrat Brad Henry left office. Hofmeister is a two-term state superintendent of public instruction who won both of her races, in 2014 and 2018, as a Republican, before changing parties in 2021 to run for governor this year. The party switch came after Hofmeister and Stitt had feuded over education funding, private school vouchers and Covid-related health policies \u2013 most prominently over mask requirements in schools, which Stitt sought to make optional. Hofmeister supports abortion rights, an issue that became a flashpoint in the race after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and abortion rights supporters in neighboring\u00a0 Kansas won an August referendum over whether to retain the state\u2019s constitutional protections for the procedure. Stitt opposes abortion but said he would sign into law an exemption to the state\u2019s current ban for cases of rape and incest. \u00a0 Hofmeister sought to portray herself as a moderate voice who would temper both parties\u2019 extremes. Stitt, meanwhile, tried to latch her to President Joe Biden -- who lost Oklahoma to then-President Donald Trump in 2020 by 33 points. \u00a0 \u201cMy opponent, she couldn't see a path forward for herself as a Republican, so she joined Biden's party,\u201d Stitt said in a debate. \u00a0 The late-October debate provided a viral moment when Hofmeister blamed Stitt for the state\u2019s violent crime problem. \u00a0 \u201cThe fact is, the rates of violent crime are higher in Oklahoma under your watch than in New York or California,\u201d Hofmeister said. \u00a0 A seemingly incredulous Stitt shot back: \u201cHang on, Oklahomans, do you believe we have higher crime than New York or California? That\u2019s what she just said.\u201d \u00a0 Hofmeister was right: Oklahoma\u2019s homicide rate of 9 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is higher than New York\u2019s 4.7 deaths and California\u2019s 6.1 deaths.\u00a0 ##Governor## US stocks were up in after-hours trading as results from Tuesday's midterm elections started rolling in.\u00a0 Investors have been betting on a big Republican wave in the elections. If Republicans take at least one chamber of Congress, that will likely result in more gridlock, which the market usually loves. Investors are more than happy when politicians bicker but don't actually enact any new laws that may hurt corporate profits. Dow futures were up 16 points, or about 0.1%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%. Early results on election night can be very different from the final outcome once all the votes are tallied. That process can take days. \"If Republicans do well and take back control of one or both chambers of Congress, we see the event as a positive for the stock market into year-end,\" Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients on Monday. \"But if Republicans only take back control of the House, and not the Senate, we suspect the gains in the S&P 500 may be modest.\" To read more on the markets, click here Anthony Brown will be the first Black person elected attorney general of Maryland, CNN projects.  Brown, who currently represents Maryland\u2019s 5th Congressional District, has a been a longtime fixture in state politics, having also served as state lieutenant governor and in the state House and run for governor in 2014.\u00a0 ##Other Races## Democrat Wes Moore will be elected governor of Maryland, CNN projects, becoming the first Black person to lead the state.\u00a0 He will defeat Republican state Delegate Dan Cox, an election denier backed by former President Donald Trump who ran on a hardline conservative platform. Retiring GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate, did not endorse Cox, who had defeated Hogan\u2019s chosen successor in the Republican primary in July.\u00a0 Moore will be just the third Black American to be elected governor in US history, after Virginia\u2019s Douglas Wilder, who was elected to a term in 1989, and Massachusetts\u2019 Deval Patrick, who was first elected in 2006 and served two terms. Two others, New York\u2019s David Paterson, who served from 2008 to 2010, and Louisiana\u2019s Pinckney Pinchback, who served for a little over a year between 1872 and 1873, were elevated to the governorship after their predecessors resigned or were driven out. Pinchback was a Republican, but the other three Black governors were Democrats.\u00a0 Moore, a Rhodes scholar and former White House fellow, is also the former CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, New York City\u2019s largest anti-poverty nonprofit. He\u00a0gained national recognition after authoring the 2010 book \u201cThe Other Wes Moore,\u201d an inspirational story of two boys with the same name and ties to Baltimore.\u00a0\u00a0 The first-time candidate is also a veteran, having served as a captain and paratrooper with the US Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division, where he led soldiers in combat in Afghanistan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moore had the backing of establishment Democrats, including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, and the support of Oprah Winfrey before winning the crowded Democratic primary in July. \u00a0\u00a0 Moore, who was considered an overwhelming favorite to win in the deep-blue state, participated in only one debate with Cox, hosted by Maryland Public Television on October 12, in which the two sparred over policies and took jabs at one another. \u00a0\u00a0 Moore called Cox an \u201cextremist election denier,\u201d citing a tweet from the Republican nominee in which he touted sponsoring buses for Trump\u2019s January 6, 2021, rally following his loss in the 2020 presidential election. Cox tweeted that he was doing so to \u201c#StoptheSteal.\u201d\u00a0 Cox accused Moore\u00a0of wanting to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d to which the Democratic nominee responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Moore\u2019s running mate, former state Del. Aruna Miller, who immigrated with her family from India as a child, will also make history with her election as Maryland\u2019s first Asian American lieutenant governor. Governor and lieutenant governor nominees are elected on the same ticket in the Old Line State. \u00a0\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Melissa Holzberg DePalo, Eric Bradner and Zachary B.

Jared Polis will win reelection in Colorado, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Heidi Ganahl.\u00a0\u00a0 Polis campaigned on his record, including enacting all-day kindergarten and efforts to decrease health care costs.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet will win reelection in Colorado, CNN projects, staving off a strong challenge from Republican Joe O\u2019Dea.\u00a0 Bennet, who was first elected in 2010, was the favorite in the race, but O\u2019Dea, the CEO of a construction company, found some success in Colorado by breaking with his own party at times, pitching a more moderate position in a state that has leaned toward Democrats for years.\u00a0 Bennet, aided by the state\u2019s Democratic lean, ran a strong campaign focused on local issues like public land advocacy and broader issues like changing political culture by stopping corporate influence in politics. The Democrat also successfully pushed back on O\u2019Dea\u2019s attempt to portray a more moderate image.\u00a0 \u201cI think he\u2019s painting himself that way. I mean, it\u2019s incredible. He has said that he would have voted for all three of Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees notwithstanding the fact that he knows that they overturned Roe v. Wade. He opposes, as you just heard, Colorado\u2019s law codifying a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Bennet told CNN in October. \u201cHe says that Donald Trump, even though he probably knows better, bears no responsibility for what happened on January 6.\u201d\u00a0 Headed into the election, Democrats said they were confident Bennet would win. But the party\u2019s top Senate outside organization, Senate Majority PAC, spent millions to unsuccessfully boost O\u2019Dea\u2019s more conservative primary opponent earlier in the year.\u00a0 Bennet also may have been aided by former President Donald Trump's late, anti-O\u2019Dea foray into the race.\u00a0 After O\u2019Dea told CNN he would \u201cactively\u201d campaign against former President Donald Trump and for other GOP candidates if the former President runs again, Trump slammed him as a \u201cRINO\u201d (Republican in name only) and suggested Trump\u2019s supporters wouldn\u2019t vote for a \u201cstupid\u201d person like O\u2019Dea.\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen will win reelection in Maryland, CNN projects, defeating Republican Chris Chaffee. Prior to winning his Senate seat in 2016, Van Hollen was a member of the House from 2003 to 2017. Maryland has a Republican governor in Larry Hogan, but the state typically favors Democrats in federal elections. ##Senate## As polls close in Wisconsin, a \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d Republican Sen. Ron Johnson took the stage briefly at his election night party in Neenah, Wisconsin \u2013 but only to lead the audience in a rendition of\u00a0happy birthday\u00a0for his granddaughter. His opponent, Democratic Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes, has been feeling good throughout the night, optimistic that \u201cwe\u2019ve done all that we could,\u201d but also urging those who were still in line as polls closed to stay in line. Neither President Biden nor former President Donald Trump visited the state once in the final two months leading up to the election, notable considering between the two they\u2019ve stopped in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Florida, and more in the final run-up.\u00a0 Sen. Johnson has touched on the wider implications of what a win for him would mean, aside from \u201csend a very strong signal to our Democrat colleagues that their policies aren\u2019t working.\u201d It could be a major contributor to Republicans winning the Senate, setting the stage for him to become chair of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs\u2019 permanent subcommittee on investigations.\u00a0 \u201cI would be like a mosquito in a nudist colony. It would be a target-rich environment,\u201d Johnson told supporters on the eve of Election Day.\u00a0 Both he and Barnes have campaigned not just on Wisconsin\u2019s Senate seat, but on the future of the country being on the line.\u00a0 If Barnes wins, he would be the state\u2019s first Black Senator and among the youngest, unseating the two-term Republican.\u00a0 \u201cI can guarantee you we have not been outworked,\u201d Barnes told CNN Monday. ##Senate## House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer will be reelected to serve his 21st full term for Maryland\u2019s 5th Congressional District, CNN projects. ##House## As the results start to trickle to in, with Democrat Tim Ryan currently in the lead in Ohio's Senate race, supporters at GOP candidate J.D. Vance\u2019s headquarters told CNN they\u2019re expecting that lead to narrow as more votes get tallied up.  Supporters are betting it will be a big night for Republicans here in the Buckeye State. One supporter told CNN they\u2019ll be watching to see how Republican congressional candidates in more competitive districts, like J.R. Majewski, perform in order to get a sense of just how big of night it will be for Ohio Republicans. Meanwhile, Ryan\u2019s camp said; while Vance has started to close the gap,\u00a0they\u2019re remaining optimistic and pointing to the fact Ryan has overperformed in the early vote in Warren, Franklin and Stark counties.\u00a0 After the polls closed, Ryan tweeted a picture of himself with son with the caption: \u201cWe left it all on the field.\" View Ryan's tweet:  ##Senate## Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, has been elected as the Bay State\u2019s governor, CNN projects, defeating GOP nominee Geoff Diehl, a state lawmaker who had been endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Healey will become Massachusetts\u2019 first elected female governor and the first out lesbian state executive in the US. Her victory reclaims the office for Democrats, who have been shut out of the corner office for all but eight of the past 30 years, in the otherwise blue state. It also marks a pick-up for national Democrats who entered the night defending 20 of the 36 contested governor\u2019s offices.\u00a0 Republican Gov. Charlie Baker decided not to seek a third term, despite his high approval ratings, after it became apparent that the Trump wing of the GOP was coalescing behind a primary challenge.\u00a0 Healey\u2019s historic victory comes on the heels of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s own pathbreaking win a year earlier, when Wu became the first woman elected to lead the city. Unlike Diehl, who defeated a moderate Republican opponent in the primary, Healey ran effectively unopposed, with her January 2022 decision to enter the contest clearing the Democratic field. ##Governor## Democratic Rep.

Pat Leahy in Democratic hands.\u00a0 Welch will join Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, in representing Vermont in the upper chamber. He announced his plans to leave the House and run for the Senate shortly after Leahy announced in November 2021 that he would not seek re-election after spending nearly 50 years in Congress.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Republican Sen. John Boozman will win reelection in Arkansas, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Natalie James. ##Senate## Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won reelection according to CNN projections, thanked voters for supporting him and his policies, touting \u201cwe have not only won an election, we have rewritten the political map.\u201d \u201cThank you for honoring us with a win for the ages,\u201d DeSantis said. The governor also thanked voters who didn\u2019t vote for him in the last election, saying that he is \u201chonored to have earned your trust and your support over these four years\u201d for reelection now.\u00a0 DeSantis said that while Tuesday\u2019s results were explicitly for the midterm elections, \u201cbut in reality Americans have been voting for many years now, they have been voting with their feet,\u201d meaning that people who are not happy with policies in other states have been moving to Florida, according to DeSantis, pointing to things like crime and the economy. \"People come here because our policies work, leadership matters,\" he added. ##Governor## \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Democrat Jonathan Jackson \u2014 the son of Rev. Jesse Jackson and brother of former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. \u2014 will win the Illinois 1st Congressional District race, CNN projects. ##House## Democratic Rep.

In a hearing that concluded two minutes before polls closed, the judge said while some voters may have been confused or faced difficulties, he didn't see any evidence of voters who wanted to vote but were unable to do so. Republicans had asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order to keep polling centers in Maricopa County open until 10 p.m. local time for provisional ballots to be cast by voters who ran into issues with tabulation machines. ##Voting## Democratic Jennifer Wexton will win her reelection bid in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District race, CNN projects. ##House## Republican Rep.

Cori Bush wins reelection bid in Missouri's 1st Congressional District race, CNN projects.\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the one-time press secretary and communications director for former President Donald Trump, will win Arkansas\u2019 gubernatorial race, CNN projects.\u00a0 She will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas. \u00a0 Huckabee Sanders defeated Democrat Chris Jones, who is a minister and former non-profit leader who got a degree in nuclear engineering from MIT.\u00a0 Arkansas last elected a Democratic governor in 2010 and it\u2019s now a solidly red state.\u00a0 Sanders, while a first-time candidate,\u00a0is no stranger to politics. Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. And by defeating Democrat Chris Jones, Sanders will also become the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led. \u00a0 Sanders\u00a0previously\u00a0worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father\u2019s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 bid.\u00a0\u00a0 She gained national prominence\u00a0in her role as\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u2019s White House press secretary,\u00a0serving as a staunch defender of\u00a0the then-President\u00a0and his policies for more than two years.\u00a0On many occasions, she clashed\u00a0with national reporters and\u00a0eventually scaled back televised briefings.\u00a0She\u00a0defended the move,\u00a0saying\u00a0that journalists could hear from\u00a0Trump\u00a0directly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanders earned an early endorsement from Trump after joining the race for Arkansas governor, and prominent rivals later dropped out of the race, clearing her path to the GOP nomination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanders\u2019 path to victory in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Asa Hutchison was relatively smooth \u2013 unsurprising in a state that has taken a sharp turn to the right in recent years. But the campaign was not without personal challenges. In September, Sanders announced she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and \u201cunderwent a successful surgery to remove my thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In her race for governor, Sanders defended her decision to grant only a\u00a0handful of interviews with local media, saying she\u2019s been speaking to voters directly. \u00a0 \u201cFreedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press also comes a great deal of responsibility, and when they don\u2019t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside of the box, which I have done every single day for the last two years,\u201d Sanders said at an October 21 debate hosted by the Arkansas PBS station. \u00a0 In the debate, Sanders\u00a0highlighted key issues of her campaign, including her education plan, \u00a0Arkansas LEARNS, to increase literacy rates, and her support for phasing out the state income tax, though she has not explicitly stated a timeline for doing so.

Incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson faces Republican\u00a0Kristina Karamo, who has backed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election.\u00a0 And these are the races playing out in Wisconsin: Wisconsin is one of the most closely divided states in the nation, and GOP Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers both face highly competitive reelection campaigns.\u00a0 Johnson, who has a history of controversial statements about the pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack, is facing Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who at one point signaled support for\u00a0removing police funding.\u00a0 Evers faces Republican businessman Tim Michels, who won Trump\u2019s support in the primary by aggressively amplifying the former president\u2019s 2020 election lies.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Priya Krishnakumar and Will Mullery contributed reporting to this post.\u00a0 See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here.\u00a0\u00a0 Voters in Pennsylvania are split over whether Democratic Senate candidate\u00a0John Fetterman\u2019s health is good enough to represent the state effectively, according to the preliminary results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Fetterman, Pennsylvania\u2019s lieutenant governor,\u00a0suffered a near-fatal stroke\u00a0days before he won the May Democratic primary. But a majority of voters said that Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate, has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. More than 4 in 10 said he had. Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades. Voters also split over which candidate\u2019s views are too extreme with more than 4 in 10 picking Fetterman and the same share selecting Oz. More than one-third of Pennsylvania voters said that they care most about whether a candidate shares their values and whether a candidate has honesty and integrity. About 2 in 10 said the most important quality is that a candidate cares about people like them. Fewer than one in 10 said having the right experience matters most. Men and women who cast ballots split their support, with more than half of men voting for Oz and more than half of women voting for Fetterman. Among independent voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, more than half voted for Fetterman. For voters who thought that abortion was the most important issue, more than three quarters supported Fetterman. They made up just over one-third of the electorate. But among those who said inflation was the most pressing issue, more than three-quarters cast ballots for Oz. They made up more than a quarter of the electorate.

There were 3,058 of those, the county spokesperson told CNN.\u00a0 A total of 156,000 mail-ins/absentee votes \u2014 which had already been sent in \u2014 were processed at the warehouse earlier today.\u00a0 Now that polls have closed, they will assign all those votes to candidates.\u00a0 Rich Fitzgerald, executive of Allegheny County, said that Democrats Josh Shapiro, candidate for governor, and John Fetterman, candidate for Senate, have out-performed Joe Biden in the mail-in and absentee voting in Allegheny County.\u00a0 In 2010 Biden got about 80% of the mail-in and absentee voting in Allegheny, Fitzgerald said. Shapiro won 89% of that vote tonight and Fetterman won about 85% of it in the Senate race, he said.  Fitzgerald said he expects the Allegheny vote count, overall, to be done quickly tonight.\u00a0 ##Voting## \u00a0 Democrat Robert Menendez Jr. \u2014 the son of Sen. Bob Menendez \u2014 will win New Jersey\u2019s 8th Congressional District race, CNN projects.\u00a0 Menendez defeated Republican Marcos Arroyo, who was running uncontested in the GOP primary. Correction: An earlier version of this post gave the wrong name for the Republican challenger. Robert Menendez Jr. defeated Marcos Arroyo. ##House##\u00a0 In North Carolina\u2019s Senate race, Democratic candidate Cheri Beasley is leading her opponent, Republican Ted Budd \u2014\u00a0but most of those results are coming from early voting. The polls closed at 7:30 p.m. ET and these early voting numbers show about 53% of the estimated vote being reported, CNN\u2019s David Chalian said in analysis. Of the current votes that are in, 96% are coming from early voting. \u201cAt the end of the day we think in North Carolina, only 55% is going to be pre-election vote,\u201d Chalian explained, adding that generally, early voting tends to favor Democrats. \u201cSo right now most of what you are seeing there is pre-election vote.\u201d Here\u2019s how the results break down even further: Among people who voted by mail, Beasley leads by 46%, with still about 24% of ballots left to be counted.\nFor those who voted early, Beasley also leads by 6.2%, with about 5% still to be counted.\nBudd, however, leads by more than 37% in votes cast on Election Day \u2014 but there is still a lot left to go. More than 95% of Election Day votes have not been counted yet. CNN's David Chalian breaks it down: ##Senate## ##Analysis## Here's what the maps for Senate and House races looks like as of 8:30 p.m. ET. Control of both chambers of Congress is on the line in Tuesday's election, with the GOP needing net gains of just one seat to win the Senate and five seats to win the House.\u00a0 Senate:  House:  Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson will a reelection bid in Texas\u2019 13th Congressional District, CNN projects. Jackson was backed by former President Donald Trump \u2014 having served as White House physician during his term. ##House## Ukrainian GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz will win reelection in Indiana\u2019s 5th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 Spartz is the first Ukrainian-born member of the US Congress and is an outspoken advocate for her home country amid the ongoing war.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Republican Gov. Chris Sununu will win reelection in New Hampshire, CNN projects. ##Governor## Roughly 8 in 10 North Carolina voters said the economy is \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cnot good,\u201d according to the preliminary results of the North Carolina Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. More than three-quarters of voters in the state said inflation has caused them and their family severe or moderate hardship. About half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden\u2019s policies are hurting the country, while only 35% think they are helping. About 4 in 10 North Carolina voters approve of Biden, while more than half disapprove. ##Analysis## The race for control of Congress, as well as governorships and key statewide positions, has defined the 2022 midterms. Heading into Election Day, in addition to taking control of chambers of Congress, both parties were also looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both at the Capitol and beyond. Republicans were excited about growing their roster of female governors and electing more Latino members to the US House. Democrats eyed expanding the number of Black US senators and making a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor's offices. Both parties also sought to welcome their first members of Congress from Generation Z \u2014 those born after 1996.\u00a0\u00a0 Election results are still coming in, and many races won't be called for days, if not weeks. But for now, here's a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.\u00a0\u00a0 Alabama Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.\u00a0\u00a0 Florida Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida's 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.\u00a0\u00a0 Oklahoma Republican Markwayne Mullin will be the first Native American senator from Oklahoma in almost 100 years, CNN projects, winning the special election to succeed GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is resigning in January. Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation, currently represents the state's 2nd Congressional District. Democrat Robert Owen, also a member of the Cherokee Nation, represented Oklahoma in the Senate from 1907 to 1925.\u00a0 ##Catch Up## Republican Gov. Bill Lee will win reelection in Tennessee, CNN projects. ##Governor## GOP Gov. Henry McMaster will win reelection in South Carolina, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Joe Cunningham.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 First-term Republican Sen. Todd Young will hold his Indiana Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Thomas McDermott, the mayor of Hammond.\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 It\u2019s 8:30 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in Arkansas.\u00a0 Here are some of the races playing out in the state: \u00a0 US Senate: Republican Sen. John Boozman vs. Democrat Natalie James \nGovernor: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders vs. Democrat Chris Jones See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here.\u00a0\u00a0 Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s office said Harris made calls to several politicians on Election Day.\u00a0 Harris called Reps. Jahana Hayes and Lauren Underwood, two races where the vice president campaigned and led abortion conversations. In South Carolina, Harris called Biden ally Rep. James Clyburn.  The vice president also called state legislators including\u00a0Nevada State Rep. Sandra Jauregui, Pennsylvania State Rep. Joanna McClinton, Florida State Rep. Fentrice Driskell, and Michigan State Rep. Keith Williams. Harris also held abortion roundtables in all states where the state legislators govern. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz will win reelection in Florida\u2019s 1st District, CNN projects. ##House## Incumbent GOP congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene will win her reelection bid in Georgia\u2019s 14th Congressional District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House## Ohio voters have approved an amendment to the state constitution to require that only a citizen of the United States can vote at any state or local election, CNN projects, assuming they meet other requirements. The new measure would prohibit local governments from allowing a person to vote in local elections if they are not legally qualified to vote in state elections. The vote is a win for Ohio Republicans, who had sought to cast noncitizen voting as a threat to democracy and a logistical headache.\u00a0 GOP state Rep. Bill Seitz\u00a0declared in a Dayton Daily News op-ed this month: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have borders, you don\u2019t have a country.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIf non-citizens could vote just the same as citizens, you won\u2019t have a country for long. That\u2019s why both candidates for Ohio Governor and a unanimous Ohio Senate support Issue 2, and why a large bipartisan majority of the Ohio House did too,\u201d Seitz said.\u00a0 Democrats and voting rights organizations fell short in their effort to cast the measure as too broad, given that it will also eliminate the voting rights of 17-year-olds \u2013 something the state permits in certain circumstances \u2013 and bar people from registering to vote within 30 days of an election.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIncorporating perspectives of non-US citizen residents by allowing them to vote on local issues adds value. These active community members pay taxes, own businesses and have children attending our schools; they are part of the fabric of communities and are affected by local government decisions,\u201d Brian Housh, council president of the Village of Yellow Springs, wrote in a dueling op-ed.\u00a0 ##Catch Up## Incumbent Republican Greg Pence will win his reelection bid in Indiana\u2019s 6th Congressional District race, CNN projects. He is brother of former Vice President Mike Pence.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 John Fetterman's campaign knows it will take a while to get the vote count out of Philadelphia, where they will need to run up the score against Republican Mehmet Oz.\u00a0 While they wait, the campaign has its eyes on a handful of bellwether counties including Erie, Northampton, Bucks and Centre counties, according to a senior campaign source.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, the source said the campaign will be watching to see if Fetterman outperforms Joe Biden in places like York County, where he lost by 25 points in 2020. Republican Laurel Lee will win in Florida\u2019s 15th District, CNN projects. ##House## \u00a0 Republican Anna Paulina Luna will win in Florida\u2019s 13th District, CNN projects.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 Republican Cory Mills will win in Florida\u2019s 7th District, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Karen Green.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House##\u00a0 A judge in Houston has ordered voting locations in Harris County to stay open for one additional hour following a lawsuit filed by the Texas Civil Rights Project and the Texas ACLU stating several polling locations were not open on time. \u201cA judge has issued a Temporary Restraining Order in this suit, which will keep the polls in Harris County open until 8pm CT,\u201d\u00a0the Texas Civil Rights Project said in\u00a0a press release.\u00a0 According to\u00a0the Texas Civil Rights Project, all 782 Harris County polling locations are affected by the change and voters who get in line from 7\u00a0p.m.\u00a0to 8\u00a0p.m.\u00a0CT\u00a0will have to cast a provisional ballot. Several polling places in Harris County experienced long lines of up to two hours at a large voting center in Houston, CNN affiliate KHOU\u00a0reported, due to technical issues with voting machines.\u00a0 \"We are grateful to the court order that polling locations in Harris County will stay open until 8 p.m. CT,\u201d\u00a0said Ashley Harris,\u00a0an attorney for\u00a0ACLU of Texas. \"Nobody should be denied their fundamental right to vote simply because their polling location did not open on time. We encourage everyone who hasn\u2019t cast a ballot to go to their nearest voting precinct,\" she said.  The groups sued on behalf of the Texas Organizing Project, a nonprofit advocacy group for Black and Latino communities. ##Voting## Democrat Maxwell Frost, a 25-year-old community organizer, will win Florida\u2019s 10th Congressional District, CNN projects, becoming the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress.\u00a0 Frost will defeat Republican Calvin Wimbish in the race for the Orlando-area seat to succeed Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who vacated the seat for a Senate run.\u00a0 Members of Generation Z \u2014 those born after 1996 \u2014 are eligible to be elected to the US House of Representatives for the first time in this election. (House members must be at least 25 years old.)\u00a0 Frost has leaned into his youth throughout his campaign and has generated buzz through social media and public interviews.\u00a0 Frost had the endorsements of notable progressives such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as well as the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, on his way to winning a crowded primary in August that included a state senator and two former members of Congress. He was the heavy favorite in the general election in a deep-blue seat that now-President Joe Biden would have carried by 32 points in 2020.\u00a0 ##House## Multiple states have reported attempted cyberattacks on their websites on Election Day, but none of the hacks have prevented anyone from voting, federal officials told reporters Tuesday night. Mississippi is the only state that has reported a \u201csustained outage\u201d of a website from the hacks, said a senior official from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\u00a0 Officials did not name the other states that had reported the low-level hacking activity.\u00a0 The clerk of Champaign County, Illinois, told CNN earlier Tuesday that his office had been fending off a suspected cyberattack.\u00a0 \u201cWe have not seen any evidence to suggest that these are part of a widespread coordinated campaign,\u201d the CISA official said.\u00a0\u00a0 The website of Mississippi\u2019s secretary of state has been down for multiple hours Tuesday after a Russian-speaking hacking group listed it as a target. CNN has reached out to the Mississippi secretary of state\u2019s office for comment. How this impacts voters: Such websites are not involved in the casting or counting of votes, but they often provide voters with information on how and where to vote. Hackers try to take them down to sow panic or make exaggerated claims about their impact. The CISA official also sought to tamp down conspiracy theories that seize on the fact that it takes time to tabulate and certify election results.\u00a0 \u201cThis may take days to weeks depending on state law \u2014 and that is completely normal,\u201d the official said.\u00a0 Republican Rudy Yakym will win the election for Indiana\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, CNN projects, succeeding the late GOP Rep. Jackie Walorski, who died in a car accident this year with two of her staffers. Yakym, a former Walorski campaign finance director, will defeat Democrat Paul Steury, a high school science teacher, in the reliably red South Bend-based district. He is also projected to win the special election on serving out the remainder of 2022. Yakym won his party\u2019s nomination in October after earning the endorsement of Dean Swihart, the husband of the late congresswoman, who introduced the candidate before the state GOP voting caucus in August as a \"pro-Trump, pro-life and Christian family man,\u201d according to the South Bend Tribune. Yakym, a married father of three, has worked at a logistics company and is the head usher at his Baptist church, according to his biography on the National Republican Congressional Committee website.  ##House## There is no sense of alarm among Georgia Republicans tonight \u2014 despite Democrats jumping to an early advantage as the first batch of votes is counted in the first hour after polls close. Why? The ballots counted so far come largely from the record-setting early ballots cast in Georgia \u2014 more than 2 million in all. A strategist inside the GOP war room \u2014 pouring over data for Gov. Brian Kemp and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker \u2014 say the votes from Election Day will overwhelmingly benefit Republicans. CNN has not yet made projections on these races. \u201cWe like what we see from our turnout today,\u201d the GOP strategist said. \u201cThat will become apparent soon enough.\u201d Yet one question looms large: Will there be a significant fall-off from Kemp to Walker? And did those voters back Warnock or not vote in the Senate race at all? ##Analysis##  Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, tells CNN \u201cwe are getting ready for a big red mirage and blue shift,\u201d citing an \u201cexplosion in early voting and absentee voting\u201d in locations with large central count facilities like Milwaukee, Green Bay and Kenosha.\u00a0 The effect \u201ccould be magnified compared to 2018,\u201d Wikler added.\u00a0 According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, historically jurisdictions that count ballots at central count facilities \u201chave been some of the last to complete unofficial results reporting.\u201d Wikler said, \u201cKenosha\u2019s really the biggest question mark on the map.\u201d Chad Doran, director of communications for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, tells CNN they\u2019re \u201cwatching\u201d for any red mirage-type scenarios. \u201cDay-of voting appears to be beating expectations, which is generally a good sign for Republicans,\" Doran said. Polls in Wisconsin close at 9 p.m. ET. ##Voting## A Georgia state election official says America needs candidates to be \u201cgracious\u201d in both defeat and victory.  Acting Georgia Deputy Secretary of State Gabriel Sterling stressed that the\u00a0US\u00a0needs political candidates to be \u201cgracious\u201d and publicly trust election results regardless of whether they win or lose.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe have reached a point in our nation\u2019s history where we need leaders and candidates for both parties to step up and say,\u00a0\u2018I accept the results of this election\u2019\u00a0regardless of the outcome,\u201d Sterling said during a news conference Tuesday night in Atlanta.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt sucks to lose, but here\u2019s the math \u2013 there is always going to be somebody who wins and somebody who comes up short.\u00a0For the stability of the nation as a whole, and for the defense for the institutions as they stand, candidates should gracefully accept defeat when the voters have said that to them and they should gracefully accept victory and not rub it in and spike the football,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sterling said that both Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, himself, and other state election officials have been \u201cstewing\u201d on this in\u00a0the aftermath of the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump\u00a0falsely claimed the election was rigged and tried to overturn the results.\u00a0But\u00a0Sterling\u00a0said that he is bringing this up tonight due to the fact that \u201cwe already have candidates out there saying if I lose it\u2019s because it\u2019s rigged.\u00a0That\u2019s a pile of crap.\u00a0They know it is when they say it,\u201d an emotional Sterling said. \u201cThe system cannot take another two or four years of election denial, be it by voter suppression or voter fraud.\u00a0Both of them are false claims, that have been proven false again and again and again,\u201d\u00a0Sterling pleaded.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe have to stop weaponizing election administration, we have to stop weaponizing the end results of this election.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0##Voting## Republican Sen. Rand Paul will win the Kentucky Senate race, CNN projects, and defeat progressive Democrat Charles Booker.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Republican Katie Britt will win Alabama\u2019s Senate race, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Will Boyd, the pastor of the St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church. It's the first time the state has elected a woman to the office.\u00a0 Britt is the former chief of staff for retired Sen. Richard Shelby. The drama in this race came in the Republican primary when Britt took on Rep. Mo Brooks. Trump initially endorsed Brooks,\u00a0but he rescinded the endorsement as Brooks\u2019 campaign struggled. Democrats last won a Senate seat in Alabama in 2017 when Doug Jones won a special election against Republican Roy Moore. Britt\u2019s chances in crimson red Alabama were never in doubt -- the competitive race was for the Republican nomination to succeed the retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby.\u00a0 Britt jumped into the primary race even though Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks had already earned former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement.\u00a0\u00a0 But Brooks \u2013\u00a0who led the charge in Congress to overturn the 2020 election results\u00a0\u2013 was viewed as an unreliable ally to the business community, especially compared to Shelby, who delivered federal funding for the state for decades. And Britt, Shelby\u2019s former chief of staff and the Business Council of Alabama\u2019s former CEO, had deep ties to that wing of the party.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, a self-funded Republican candidate, Lynda Blanchard, the former Trump ambassador to Slovenia, never took off and dropped out of the race. Army veteran pilot Mike Durant -- of \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d fame -- was weighed down by his sister\u2019s public claims that he was in denial about her\u00a0allegations of sexual abuse\u00a0involving their father, which Durant strongly denied.\u00a0\u00a0 And Britt was able to flip Trump. At a Super Bowl party, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick\u00a0praised\u00a0Britt\u2014and her husband Wesley, a former Patriot\u2014to Trump. That sparked an invitation to Trump\u2019s Palm Beach estate.\u00a0\u00a0 Britt had already cast herself as a Trump-aligned conservative, arguing that Brooks was a career politician, who had heavily criticized Trump during the 2016 GOP presidential primary.\u00a0In March, after\u00a0Brooks publicly accused Trump of asking him to break the law by exploring ways to reinstall him as commander in chief, Trump\u00a0dropped\u00a0the congressman.\u00a0\u00a0 In the May primary, Britt received 45% of the vote, but since no candidate received over 50%, the race turned to a June runoff election. Trump then endorsed Britt, who beat Brooks with 63% of the vote.\u00a0 ##Senate## Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will win a special election for US Senate, CNN projects, making him the first Native American to represent Oklahoma in the chamber in nearly a century.\u00a0\u00a0 Mullin, who currently represents the deeply conservative 2nd Congressional District, will defeat Democratic nominee Kendra Horn, a former congresswoman, in the race for the seat of GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is resigning in January.\u00a0\u00a0 A citizen of the Cherokee Nation, Mullin was first elected to his House seat in eastern Oklahoma in 2012 and went on to closely align himself with former President Donald Trump.\u00a0 He voted in 2021 to object to the congressional certification of now-President Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College wins in Pennsylvania and Arizona. Mullin tweeted at the time that he was objecting \u201cdue to all the fraud and uncertainty,\u201d though there has been no evidence of fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome.\u00a0Two days prior to the vote, he told constituents that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not think the election was honest.\u00a0 But Mullin sought to anchor his Senate campaign in more broad Republican positions, listing \u201cRESTORE Law and Order\u201d and \u201cFIGHT the Liberal Biden Agenda\u201d as priorities on his campaign website.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m running to keep this seat RED, fight for our conservative values in the Senate, and Save America from Biden\u2019s far left insanity,\u201d his website reads.\u00a0\u00a0 Less prominent in Mullin\u2019s campaign messaging was that fact he was running to be the first Native American senator from Oklahoma since Robert Owen left Congress in 1925, though he did acknowledge the historic nature of his Senate bid during a speech in September.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to be the only true Native American in the Senate when I get elected,\u201d Mullin told the National Tribal Health Conference in Washington, DC. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHow crazy that we\u2019re true Native Americans, the first Americans,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re so underrepresented in the halls of Congress.\u201d\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Republican Sen. James Lankford will win reelection in Oklahoma, CNN projects, and \tdefeat Democrat Madison Horn.\u00a0 Lankford was first elected in 2014, when he won a special election to fill the remainder of former GOP Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s term. Horn is a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen and \tcybersecurity professional.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 Florida voters will reelect Republican Sen. Marco Rubio to a third term over Democratic Rep. Val Demings, CNN projects, an outcome that is sure to harden arguments that the Sunshine State is no longer the purple battleground of yesteryear. Rubio trailed in fundraising throughout the race and operated a low-key campaign with few public events and just one debate. But it was enough to defeat Demings in a state that has been trending red since the last midterm cycle, when another Senate contest was decided in a recount. The race in Florida entered the election cycle as one to watch. The decision by Demings to challenge Rubio provided a much-needed shot in the arm to a Florida Democratic Party that has struggled to nominate strong candidates. As a Black woman and former Orlando police chief, Demings offered a counter to Republican narratives that Democrats were soft on crime. Demings also proved to be a formidable fundraiser, pulling in more money than Rubio every quarter she was in the race.\u00a0 But Demings\u2019 background in law enforcement did not deter Rubio from running ads tying her to anti-law enforcement sentiments in her party, and he often touted the endorsement of most of the state\u2019s elected sheriffs and its police unions.\u00a0\u00a0 Republican voters now outnumber Democrats by more than 300,000 in Florida, a complete reversal from the last time Rubio appeared on the ballot. Under the state\u2019s rightward lurch, Rubio embraced former President Donald Trump, his one-time rival, and he became an original cosponsor to a national 15-week abortion ban introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham, even as Demings and Democrats tried to make the election a referendum on abortion access.\u00a0 Rubio\u2019s victory comes six years after he nearly bowed out of politics following his failed presidential campaign. As Florida\u2019s senior senator, he will resume his post as one of the Republican Party\u2019s most influential voices on foreign policy at a time of growing tension around the globe over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s rise as a world power and widespread economic unrest over inflation.\u00a0 The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio was first elected to the US Senate in 2010 in a three-way race against Democrat Kendrick Meek and then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who ran as an independent. Rubio won reelection in 2016 over Democrat Patrick Murphy. Rubio previously served as a state lawmaker in Florida, where he rose to speaker of the state House.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Senate## Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey will win reelection, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Yolanda \tFlowers.\u00a0 Ivey first became governor in 2017 when former GOP Gov. Robert Bentley resigned.\u00a0\u00a0 The Alabama governor did have to fend off a primary challenge from Lindy Blanchard, the former ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration, who criticized Ivey for issuing mask mandates to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s hard-charging Republican leader who became a household name during the pandemic, will win a second term leading the Sunshine State, CNN projects, thwarting Democrat Charlie Crist\u2019s attempt to take back his old job.\u00a0 With the campaign for reelection behind him, the focus of DeSantis\u2019 political future will now turn to 2024. A decision is looming on whether he rides his political success in Florida into a national campaign for the White House, where he may find himself on a collision course with former President Donald Trump.\u00a0 On the campaign trail, DeSantis spent little time on Crist, instead focusing on President Joe Biden and his nationalized political battles. His campaign released a series of compelling, sharply produced videos and ads geared as much toward his growing national following on social media and email as Florida voters. In one labeled \"Top Gov,\" DeSantis, who served as a Navy lawyer, cosplayed as a fighter pilot as he shared his \"rules of engagement\" for \"dogfighting\" with the \"corporate media.\" In another, his wife Casey DeSantis delivered an emotional account of her battle with breast cancer. His final ad suggested God created DeSantis to be a fighter.\u00a0\u00a0 En route to his victory, DeSantis built an unprecedented cash advantage over Crist and his $31 million campaign. Half of the $200 million DeSantis raised came from donations of $50,000 or more, though he also received tens of thousands of small contributions from across the country. As of November 3, DeSantis had $66 million unused between his two political committees. Sources close to the governor's team previously told CNN that DeSantis' political operation had explored how to leverage leftover campaign money for a federal race.\u00a0 Crist struggled to gain traction after winning the primary against state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried in late August. His campaign was further hampered by the September arrival of Hurricane Ian, which brought the race to a screeching halt and postponed a planned rally and fundraiser with Biden and the race's only scheduled debate. Biden did Crist no favors when he complimented DeSantis' handling of Ian during a joint appearance in Fort Myers Beach.\u00a0\u00a0 Crist attempted to make DeSantis' known political aspirations into an issue in the race. During their only debate, Crist challenged DeSantis to vow to serve a full four-year term if reelected as governor. DeSantis declined. In a canned line he appeared to read off a paper, DeSantis said of his future political ambitions: \"The only worn-out, old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist.\"\u00a0\u00a0 In a second term, DeSantis has promised to eliminate permits to carry firearms and further \"expand pro-life protections,\" though he has not outlined what those might be.\u00a0\u00a0 DeSantis was first elected to the US House in 2012. He was reelected twice, though he resigned his third term early after securing the Republican nomination for governor in 2018. DeSantis defeated a more establishment-backed candidate in that primary on the back of an endorsement from Trump.\u00a0 ##Governor##\u00a0 It\u2019s 8 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in the following states: \u00a0 Alabama\u00a0\u00a0\nConnecticut\u00a0\u00a0\nDelaware\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorida \u00a0\nIllinois\u00a0\u00a0\nMaine\u00a0\u00a0\nMaryland\u00a0\u00a0\nMassachusetts\u00a0\u00a0\nMississippi \u00a0\nMissouri\u00a0\u00a0\nNew Hampshire\u00a0\u00a0\nNew Jersey\u00a0\u00a0\nOklahoma\u00a0\u00a0\nPennsylvania\u00a0\u00a0\nRhode Island\u00a0\u00a0\nTennessee\u00a0\u00a0 Polls are also closing in some House districts in Kansas, Michigan and Texas. \t\u00a0 One thing to note: Polls\u00a0in Luzerne County,\u00a0Pennsylvania,\u00a0will stay open until\u00a010 p.m.\u00a0ET, according to an order from Judge Lesa S. Gelb.\u00a0Attorneys petitioning for the extension of time cited a paper shortage at polling locations that ultimately resulted in the inability to print paper ballots and necessitated the use of emergency and provisional ballots, resulting in delays for voters.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what to know about the key races happening in Pennsylvania: The state that put President Biden over the top in 2020 is\u00a0home to some of the most important Senate and gubernatorial races in the country. \u00a0 Republicans are hoping to hold on to an open Senate seat with former TV personality Mehmet Oz, while Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is hoping his nontraditional appeal can help him move the seat into the Democrats\u2019 column.\u00a0 State Attorney General Josh Shapiro is trying to maintain Democratic control of Pennsylvania\u2019s governorship in a race that has taken on added importance because the governor appoints the official responsible for elections. Shapiro\u2019s opponent is Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who was a\u00a0central figure supporting Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\u00a0 See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Priya Krishnakumar and Will Mullery contributed reporting to this post. \u00a0 \u00a0 Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock\u00a0of Georgia who is locked in tight reelection race with Republican Herschel Walker, lost some support among Black and Hispanic voters in Tuesday\u2019s closely watched election, compared with the special runoff election the Democrat won in 2021, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The votes in Georgia continue to be counted, but the race is widely expected to be close. Roughly 9 in 10 Black voters and nearly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters in Georgia supported Warnock, but he lost several percentage points among each group, the preliminary exit polls found. Warnock also shed a few percentage points of support among men who cast ballots and among voters age 64 and younger. However, the senator gained a small amount of support among White voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate, and among senior citizens. Still, Walker was the candidate of choice among more than two-thirds of White voters, as well as among a majority of men who cast ballots. A majority of women who voted and around 8 in 10 non-White voters opted for Warnock. More than half of voters age 45 and older cast ballots for Walker, while nearly 6 in 10 younger voters selected Warnock. ##Analysis## ##Senate## More than three-quarters of Ohio voters said the nation\u2019s economy was \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cnot so good,\u201d according to the preliminary results of the Ohio Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. And nearly three-quarters of Buckeye State voters said inflation has caused their family severe or moderate hardship, with nearly 2 in 10 saying their difficulties were severe. More than half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden\u2019s policies are hurting, while about one-third said they are helping. The president is not that popular among Ohio voters \u2013 more than half disapprove of him, with more than 4 in 10 approving. ##Analysis## The top election official for the city of Milwaukee told reporters Tuesday evening that she expects an overall turnout of 70-75% of registered voters from that area of the state.\u00a0 Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission, told reporters that this is close to the same level of turnout as what was seen in 2018 and the number of absentee ballots will likely be lower than what was initially expected.\u00a0 Milwaukee is one of 38 municipalities in Wisconsin that processes its absentee ballots at a \u201ccentral count,\u201d or a single location, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.  In Milwaukee and other central count cities, absentee votes are reported\u00a0only\u00a0after they are all counted, while elsewhere in the state, absentee and in-person votes are generally counted and reported at the same time.\u00a0 As of Tuesday morning, more than 60,000 voters in Milwaukee had returned absentee ballots, more than in any other municipality in the state.\u00a0 Woodall-Vogg said election workers at the Milwaukee central count are still on track to finish tallying the city\u2019s absentee ballots by 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. CT on Tuesday night. ##Voting## Based on early voting tallies coming in on two key races in Georgia, some voters are voting for one party's candidate in the Senate race, but then choosing another party's candidate in the gubernatorial race. For example, Democratic nominee and Sen. Raphael Warnock has more actual votes than Democratic candidate for governor Stacey Abrams on the same ticket. Early results show Warnock with about 80,000 more votes than Abrams, \"meaning people are voting for\u00a0Raphael Warnock, and then not\u00a0voting for Abrams,\" CNN's John King explained, adding that some of those votes are going to Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp. This is visible specifically in Democratic-leaning Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, where GOP nominee Herschel Walker has fewer than 65,000 votes while Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp has received about 79,000 votes so far. The early numbers show \"Herschel Walker underperforming the governor,\" King said in his analysis. ##Analysis## Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson spent Election Day in Oshkosh with his family after casting his ballot at the Oshkosh Town Hall with his wife, his campaign told CNN.  The Republican also spent time with his grandchildren and dialed into some GOTV radio hits and teletown halls with supporters.\u00a0 For his part, Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes spent the day in the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee, hopping from college campus to college campus to greet students at\u00a0Milwaukee Area Technical College,\u00a0UW-Milwaukee, and\u00a0Marquette University.  He tweeted: \u201cstudents at Marquette are fired up and ready to send Ron Johnson packing. So inspired by all of y\u2019all and your determination to be the change you seek.\u201d  If elected, Barnes would be the nation\u2019s second-youngest senator \u2014 older only than Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff.  View Barnes' tweet:  ##Senate## Republican Gov. Mike DeWine will win reelection in Ohio, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Nan Whaley. ##Governor## It\u2019s 7:30 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in the following states: \u00a0 North Carolina\u00a0\u00a0\nOhio\u00a0\u00a0\nWest Virginia\u00a0\u00a0 See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here. Republicans are asking a judge in Maricopa County to keep the polls open until 10 p.m. local time and to suspend the public release of any early ballot returns until 11 p.m.\u00a0local time.\u00a0 The lawsuit against Maricopa County officials alleges that 36% of the county\u2019s voting centers have seen excessive delays and long lines because of continuing malfunctions of ballot tabulation devices and printers.\u00a0 Maricopa County has debunked the claims\u00a0of excessive delays, CNN's Daniel Dale has reported. Additionally, the lawsuit claims that voters in some polling places were instructed by poll workers to discard their ballots when the tabulation device could not read their ballot and to go to another polling place where they were not necessarily registered.\u00a0 The lawsuit alleges that these voters were subsequently turned away at these polling places. CNN's Ella Nilsen reported earlier today that Maricopa County elections officials insisted that every vote would be counted, despite earlier tabulation issues that arose from a printer issue at about 60 vote centers.\u00a0 \u201cThere was no one who came today with a valid ID who was turned away from the polls,\u201d Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman Bill Gates told reporters Tuesday afternoon. \u201cEven when we had this [issue] and we hadn\u2019t figured out the solution, people were still able to vote. It was just a matter of maybe not voting in the way they wanted to.\u201d The lawsuit is asking the court to instruct all inspectors at polling locations to allow voters who may be recorded as previously voting, which could be in error because of earlier delays, to complete a provisional ballot for later potential processing. ##Voting##  The campaign team for J.D. Vance, the Republican candidate vying for the open Ohio Senate seat, is buzzing with excitement as the polls are on the verge of coming to a close. A campaign source said they\u2019re seeing low turnout in Cuyahoga County \u2014 a strongly Democratic county that includes Cleveland and went for Joe Biden in 2020.\u00a0 \u201cWe like what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d the Vance campaign source said. Vance \u2014 who is watching the results from the Ohio GOP watch party tonight \u2014 has been popping in and out of the war room that his team has set up here at the hotel as they crunch numbers. As he arrived on site at the hotel, Vance was all smiles and told CNN when asked how he is feeling, \u201cWe\u2019re good, we\u2019re good.\" His campaign said they\u2019ll start to get a better sense about 30 minutes after the polls close, but in Ohio, it\u2019s all about three key cities: Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus. Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Tim Ryan's team said the Cuyahoga suburbs look good, and they believe there is a potential data lag in Cleveland proper, where precincts are less staffed.\u00a0 ##Senate## Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow said \u201cthings are going smoothly\u201d with elections in the state. Asked about recent statements from former President Donald Trump calling for protests in Detroit, Rollow said \u201cwe have prepared for this long before the former president issued his statements.\u201d\u00a0(Trump called for protests after a mishap at the polls on Tuesday morning in Detroit, which election officials called a \u201charmless data error.\u201d) When asked about an Ann Arbor poll watcher who was repeatedly issuing impermissible challenges, Rollow explained that the poll watcher was challenging voters who had brought in their blank absentee ballots to surrender before voting in-person, which is the appropriate process. Rollow was unsure if the poll watcher was \u201cremoved or simply asked to stop and they stopped,\u201d but those challenges were stopped.\u00a0 \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten reports of many challenges at all,\u201d Rollow told reporters. \u201cIf we had an appropriate challenges or numerous challenges taking place in the county boards, I believe the clerks would have communicated that to the bureau and we\u2019re not hearing that.\u201d\u00a0 For months, GOP activists have clamored about\u00a0sending a barrage of poll-watchers\u00a0to challenge ballots in battleground states.\u00a0 Separately, Detroit Election Administrator Daniel Baxton just announced to poll workers that the absentee counting board in Detroit has tabulated approximately 63,000 absentee ballots at this point. Baxter said he is waiting for 2 more deliveries\u00a0of absentee ballots\u00a0to come in to this location later tonight.\u00a0 ##Voting## More than 4 in 10 of Pennsylvania voters approve of the way\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is handling his job, but a majority disapprove of the president, who was born and raised in Scranton, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Voters in the commonwealth did not have a high opinion of former\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0either. Just 4 in 10 had a favorable opinion, while nearly 6 in 10 had an unfavorable opinion. Meanwhile, just over half of Pennsylvania voters said Biden was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the president was a factor, more than 1 in 10 said they support him, while nearly a third said they oppose him. More than half of Pennsylvania voters also said that Trump was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the former president was a factor, close to 1 in 5 said they support him, while about a quarter opposes him.

Raphael Warnock\u00a0has good judgment than they were to say the same of his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, according to the preliminary results of the Georgia exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.  But more said Warnock holds views that are too extreme than said the same about Walker. Just shy of half, about 46%, said only Warnock shows good judgment, with about 28% saying only Walker does, and nearly a fifth that neither candidate does. Voters in Georgia were close to evenly split on whether or not Warnock\u2019s views were too extreme. Slightly more than 4 in 10 said Walker\u2019s views were too extreme, with just over half saying they were not. Asked which candidate quality mattered most to their Senate vote, 36% of Georgia voters said they wanted a candidate who shared their values, 32% a candidate who had honesty and integrity, 19% a candidate who cared about people like them, and 8% someone who had the right experience. Watch CNN's John King and Jake Tapper at the Magic Wall: ##Senate## ##Analysis## Officials in Palm Beach County, Florida, intend to keep their main elections office open \u201cas long as we possibly can\u201d to count ballots and deliver midterm election results, the county\u2019s Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link said Tuesday. Parts of the county are under evacuation orders starting early Wednesday morning, as Tropical Storm Nicole is expected to make landfall in the state late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning between West Palm Beach and Melbourne. The storm is currently expected to reach Florida as a hurricane.\u00a0 \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re thinking we can make it through without a big effect on the election,\u201d Link said in a telephone interview with CNN. Worsening road conditions Tuesday night could cause some delays as officials retrieve ballot drop boxes, but Link said workers \u201cwill stay here until we\u2019re done.\u201d She anticipates that the county will process mail-in and Election Day ballots Tuesday night and could post the lion\u2019s share of initial, unofficial results on the county\u2019s website by 9 p.m. Link said workers plan to return Wednesday to answer voters\u2019 questions and continue processing the remaining classes of ballots, including those cast provisionally at polling places and mail-in ballots that need to be corrected in some way. Voters have until 5 p.m. Thursday to fix, or \u201ccure\u201d flaws on mail ballots. Link did not know early Tuesday evening how many of those kinds of ballots still were outstanding.\u00a0A little more than 1 million registered voters live in Palm Beach County. ##Voting## Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, will win reelection, CNN projects, and defeat Democratic state Rep. Krystle Matthews.\u00a0 ##Senate##\u00a0 It\u2019s 7 p.m. ET, and polls are closing statewide in these six states: \u00a0 Georgia\u00a0\nIndiana\u00a0\u00a0\nKentucky\u00a0\u00a0\nSouth Carolina\u00a0\u00a0\nVermont\u00a0\u00a0\nVirginia\u00a0\u00a0 Polls are also closing in some House districts in Florida.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what to know about the races happening in the key state of Georgia: Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock\u00a0won Senate seats to flip control of the chamber to Democrats. Warnock is now competing for a full term against Trump-backed football star Herschel Walker, who has maintained GOP support despite several scandals.\u00a0 Republican Gov. Brian Kemp\u00a0survived a Trump-endorsed primary challenger this cycle\u00a0after rejecting Trump\u2019s election lies in 2020. He won his first term in office in 2018, beating Democrat Stacey Abrams by just 55,000 votes.\u00a0Abrams never conceded, and the two are facing each other again in in the 2022 midterms, but this time Kemp is coming into the race as\u00a0a Republican who stood up to Trump. If Abrams wins, she would be the\u00a0first female Black governor in US history.\u00a0 See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here. CNN\u2019s Priya Krishnakumar and Will Mullery contributed reporting to this post. \u00a0 Both Democrats and Republicans are feeling confident as polls close in Georgia.  Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s campaign says they feel like, \u201cThey went everywhere.\u201d The key to  Warnock's argument for reelection is that he has spent his time in Washington concerned about every corner of the state: rural areas, suburban areas and metro centers alike.\u00a0 \"The leader that he has demonstrated to be is also such a stark contrast to what Herschel Walker offers,\" said a top Warnock aide. Meanwhile, Republicans are also feeling good about their chances. One GOP strategist told CNN \u201cI feel great.\u201d\u00a0 The state saw record-breaking early voting totals and our colleagues out in the field at polling sites around the state saw steady turnout throughout the day.\u00a0 \u00a0 The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted unanimously to extend voting by 25 minutes at a polling precinct in Craven County on Tuesday after the precinct ran out of ballots for a short period of time. \"Fortunately, the county has a ballot-on-demand printer and was able to replenish the ballot supply,\" said\u00a0State Board Associate General Counsel Paul Cox.  \"There was a 25-minute interruption in voting during the middle of the day, middle of the afternoon, and an estimated 15, at least, voters did not come into the voting site. They turned around and went back when they found out there were no ballots to vote on,\u201d\u00a0he said. This was the State Board of Elections\u2019 second meeting of the day.\u00a0 The board earlier voted unanimously to allow three polling precincts, located in Columbus, Robeson and Wilson counties\u00a0to close one hour later after their opening was delayed on Election Day. ##Voting## Tonight will be the first time we will see the Pennsylvania Democratic nominee on an election night stage in this Senate race. John Fetterman was in a hospital bed recovering from a stroke when he became the nominee during May\u2019s primary.\u00a0 In the months following, Fetterman\u2019s health was the topic of much conversation and analysis, much of it from political pundits and analysts outside of the state. The voters we\u2019ve spoken to in the last few months have been far more focused on the issues than they were on Fetterman\u2019s health.\u00a0 Fetterman has made his stroke recovery central to his closing campaign message, reminding voters again and again in ads and at rallies: \"I got knocked down, but I did get back up.\"\u00a0 A Democratic strategist with Sen. Maggie Hassan's campaign told CNN that there is \"strong turnout in the places we need it so far,\" but cautioned \"it is still early.\"\u00a0 The strategist noted that in New Hampshire, where the overwhelming majority of people vote on Election Day, the first and last few hours are typically the busiest, so they'll be watching late turnout in blue areas closely.\u00a0\u00a0 The strategist said that though the team is \"feeling good,\" they expect it to be close.  \u201cWe have always expected this would be close. Always thought it would be,\" the strategist said. A Republican source told CNN that with between one and two hours left before polls close, \"we remain confident.\"\u00a0The source said they were hearing about \"really strong\" turnout in some GOP strongholds in the Granite State.\u00a0 More voters trust Republicans than Democrats to handle inflation and crime, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Roughly half of voters said they trusted GOP candidates on those two issues, while more than 4 in 10 voters said they trusted Democratic candidates. When it comes to the issue of abortion, however, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates. Roughly 8 in 10 of voters in\u00a0this year\u2019s midterms\u00a0said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state are being conducted fairly and accurately, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.  About half said they were very confident. Only about 2 in 10 said they were not very or not at all confident. But voters were also deeply concerned about the state of the country\u2019s democracy. Slightly fewer than 3 in 10 said that they viewed democracy in the US today as at least somewhat secure, with about 7 in 10 feeling that democracy is somewhat or very threatened. Slightly over 6 in 10 voters accepted that Biden legitimately won the presidency in 2020, while about one-third denied the results of that election. ##Voting## ##Analysis## It was 150 years ago this year that noted suffragette and voting rights activist, Susan B. Anthony illegally cast her vote in her hometown of Rochester, New York.  She was arrested, and then convicted for voting illegally. Nearly 50 years later, after the 19th Amendment passed on June 4, 1919, White women like Anthony were legally granted the right to vote.\u00a0\u00a0 On Tuesday, women and men paid tribute to Anthony's trailblazing efforts by visiting her final resting place and leaving their \u201cI Voted Today\u201d stickers on her gravestone after voting in the 2022 midterm elections. It's been a local Rochester tradition for years now to visit the site at Mount Hope Cemetery, also the resting place of abolitionist Fredrick Douglass, on election day. New York State Sen. Samra Brouk, and Assemblymembers Sarah Clark and Jennifer Lunsford held a rally this year where supporters marched from Anthony's home to the nearest polling station in an effort to encourage women to vote in this year's midterm election. \"With all that\u2019s going on with rights for women right now, and our ability to make decisions on our own bodies and healthcare eroding, it's important for us to show up and vote,\" Assemblymember Clark said. Clark has been leaving her \u201cI Voted Today\u201d sticker at Anthony\u2019s gravestone since 2016 when, like many others, she braved the long line to get a chance to place her sticker on the women\u2019s rights advocate\u2019s gravestone in honor of Hilary Clinton. On Tuesday, Clark visited the gravesite to place that sticker on Anthony's tombstone once again, as is Rochester tradition. The headstone looks a little different than it did in 2016. For one, it's under a plastic cover protecting the grave marker being damaged from the myriad of stickers that often get placed on it every election cycle. There's also no throng of people waiting in line at the gravesite like in 2016. \"We want to remind people of the legacy and history that really lives on in Rochester,\" Assemblymember Lunsford said. ##Voting##\u00a0 While voters in this year\u2019s midterm election hold negative views of\u00a0President Joe Biden, their views of his predecessor are even more negative, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Only about 37% of voters in this year\u2019s midterms expressed a favorable view of former\u00a0President Donald Trump, with around 6 in 10 viewing him unfavorably. About 16% of voters said their House vote this year was intended to express support for Trump, with just under 3 in 10 saying it was intended to express opposition and the rest saying that Trump was not a factor. Voters\u2019 opinions of the GOP were slightly more positive than their views of Trump, with about 43% viewing the Republican Party favorably and just over half viewing it unfavorably. More than half, about 54%, say the GOP is too extreme. ##Analysis## With polls in Georgia on the verge of closing, one thing is clear in the marquee Senate race here: Herschel Walker was never disqualified by myriad allegations against him \u2013 because Republicans made a strategic decision to circle the wagons around his candidacy and take a page out of the Trump playbook in responding to a political crisis. Yet they did it without former President Trump himself. In the final stretch of the race \u2013 as Trump traveled from rally to rally and state to state \u2013 he steered clear of Georgia, despite having recruited Walker to run for Senate in the first place. A visit by Trump, many Republicans in Georgia say they feared, could be highly risky to Walker\u2019s candidacy. The two men continued to speak regularly, aides say and reached an understanding that Trump would not visit the state. Instead of Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock being able to tie Walker to Trump, it was Walker who tied Warnock to President Biden. And that, given the President\u2019s unpopularity, kept Walker in the ballgame and kept the race in a deadlock. \u00a0##Senate## While Wisconsin\u2019s Senate contest has drawn national attention as a race that could decide the balance of the Senate, the state\u2019s other marquee race \u2014 the gubernatorial election \u2014 could have equal, if not greater, ramifications for Wisconsinites.\u00a0 Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has served as a roadblock against Republicans in the State Assembly and Senate, vetoing a record number of bills out of the GOP-controlled chambers. Since taking office in 2019, the Democratic governor has blocked nearly 150 bills from becoming law, ranging on issues around the Covid-19 pandemic, election security and abortion in the state. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, the state reverted to an 1849 total ban on abortion.  In response, Evers called the legislature back for a special legislative session to overturn the law. Both chambers immediately gaveled out, leaving the law on the books. At the time, Evers warned, \u201cWe cannot afford to have Wisconsin become the worst state in the union. We have a great state here, people love living in Wisconsin, but by God, if we go down the wrong path Nov. 8, this will be a worse state.\u201d\u00a0 Evers on Tuesday evening touted his veto on nine bills out of the GOP-controlled legislature that would\u2019ve further restricted abortion in the state. \u201cI\u2019ve vetoed 9 bills that would have restricted access to abortion in Wisconsin,\u201d the Democratic governor wrote Tuesday. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m governor, I\u2019ll defend the right to safe and accessible reproductive healthcare. We need your support to keep this fight going. Head to the polls today.\u201d But even if Evers proves victorious over challenger Tim Michels, Republicans only need to flip five seats in the State Assembly and just one seat in the Senate to achieve veto-proof majorities in their respective chambers, allowing the party to push through legislation it has been trying to pass without success. For his part, Michels has pledged to overhaul elections in the state, saying at a campaign stop last month in Jefferson County that \"Republicans will never lose another election in Wisconsin after I'm elected governor.\" Polls in the state close in just a little more than two hours. ##Other Races## Whether you\u2019re the most hardened of political junkies or you only tune in\u00a0every other November\u00a0to vote, it\u2019s always a good idea to brush up on some of the terms you will hear on election night.  What is the balance of power? Political parties have more power when they control the House or Senate by winning a majority of the seats in that chamber. The party in power controls committees that write legislation and decides which measures will get a vote on the floor. In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, the party with 51 votes has the majority. What is a \u201cflipped seat\u201d or \u201cpickup\u201d? A flipped seat or pickup is one in the House or Senate that voters take from one party and entrust to the other party. Because of\u00a0redistricting, nine House seats \u2013 including seven new seats where there is no incumbent and two where two incumbents are running against each other \u2013 cannot be classified as pickups for either party. What is an \u201cincumbent?\u201d An incumbent is a lawmaker or elected official running for reelection. What is a special election? When a senator retires, dies or leaves office before his or her term ends, the state\u2019s governor usually appoints a placeholder to fill the seat. Then there\u2019s often a chance for voters to have their say, usually at the next possible federal election. That\u2019s how Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia were first elected in 2020 in special elections and why in 2022 both men are running for a full six-year term. This year, there are special Senate elections in Oklahoma, where Republican Sen. James Inhofe will be resigning next year, and in California, where Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, who was appointed to replace Vice President Kamala Harris, is running both to fill the remainder of Harris\u2019 term (which ends in January) and to win the next term. House members cannot be appointed, so when a House seat becomes vacant there needs to be a special election to fill it. This year, there\u2019s a special election in Indiana to serve the last couple months of Rep. Jackie Walorski\u2019s term. Walorski died in August. What is ranked-choice voting? A number of cities and states are experimenting with ways to give voters more access to the political process and to potentially depolarize politics. Ranked-choice voting is a system in place for most elections in Maine and Alaska where voters rank their choices in order of preference instead of picking a single candidate. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the bottom candidate is dropped and the second choice of the voters who selected that candidate gets those votes. That process repeats until a winner emerges. What does \u201cestimated vote\u201d mean? Based on data including turnout in previous elections, pre-election ballots cast or requested, and pre-election polling, organizations can anticipate how many votes are expected in a given election. An estimated vote can under- or overestimate the actual vote, and the percentage reporting may move up or down throughout Election Night depending on how those estimates are adjusted as analysts assess real-time data. As those estimates solidify, they can be useful in predicting how many votes remain to be counted. What are exit polls? Exit polls are large-scale polls conducted by a consortium of news organizations among early and absentee voters and voters on Election Day. They are conducted as voters leave polling stations, on Election Day and in many states at early voting locations, and also by telephone or online ahead of Election Day to account for mail-in and early voting. What does \u201cdown ballot\u201d mean? The top of the ticket is the race that the largest number of people in a state will see on their ballot. In a presidential year, those candidates are at the top of the ticket. Candidates in more local races are down ballot. A candidate for the House, for example, is down ballot from a presidential candidate. A mayoral candidate is down ballot from a House candidate. What is a ballot initiative? How does a state decide to put one on the ballot? While most laws are passed by state legislatures or Congress, many states put some questions directly to voters during elections. These can range from issues like marijuana legalization to abortion or tax measures. The ballot initiatives give voters a more active role in choosing the direction of their laws. What is a CNN \u201ckey race\u201d? Who decides that? \u201cKey race\u201d is a subjective term. Most politics watchers generally agree that only a subset of races is truly competitive in November, and these are generally considered the key races. Political parties spend more money on these races. Reporters spend more time covering them. Of the 35 Senate races on the ballot in 2022, the election forecasters at Inside Elections consider three to be true toss-ups and another four to tilt toward either Republicans or Democrats. Nineteen House races are true toss-ups, although many more could wind up being closely contested. Five governor races are toss-ups. See the Inside Elections ratings for\u00a0Senate,\u00a0House\u00a0and\u00a0governor. Key races can also be races that might be less competitive but have broader implications or feature especially notable candidates. Ohio election officials are working to swat down disinformation about polling places and election machines that have been circulating on social media.\u00a0 Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose called out a post claiming that voting machines were breaking down at a polling place and a sheriff had to be called as false. The\u00a0secretary of state tweeted that all machines \u201care working properly\u201d and that a sheriff was called because of \u201can isolated\u00a0instance of an individual harassing a poll worker. The situation has been peacefully resolved.\u201d\u00a0 The\u00a0Cuyahoga County Board of Elections\u00a0pushed back on a viral tweet alleging that there were last-minute changes made to polling locations in Ohio. The county board of elections said this tweet is false, and all locations were confirmed two months ago. Election officials have been actively preparing for potential disinformation and conspiracy theories about the election to spread\u00a0online, and\u00a0they have set up rapid response teams to spot and debunk falsehoods in real time. ##Voting## Officials in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania \u2014 the county seat of Pittsburgh \u2014 say there is high in-person voter turnout, as well as a signifiant mail-in and absentee vote count.  A county spokesperson, referring to absentee/mail-in ballots, told CNN that \"employees continue to extract ballots from the secrecy envelopes and are flattening those ballots for scanning. Over 130,000 ballots have been scanned so far.\u201d That means more than three-fourths of the mail-in/absentee ballots that were filed in the county have been scanned so far.\u00a0But they won\u2019t be officially assigned to candidates until after the polls close.\u00a0 Officials in Allegheny County also say of the more than 1,000 absentee/mail-in ballots that were incorrectly dated and in danger of not being counted, only about 160 people have come into the county office to \"cure,\" or correct, those faulty ballots. People have until polls close at 8 p.m. ET to cure their wrongly dated ballots.\u00a0 CNN spoke to one voter who mis-dated her ballot who said she was thinking about her daughter\u2019s wedding next year and was so preoccupied with that, that she put the wrong date on there. That\u2019s the kind of simple mistake many people are making.\u00a0 ##Voting## President Joe Biden\u2019s top advisers acknowledge the outcome of the midterm elections will likely reshape Washington \u2013 and by extension, how the White House operates. But on one specific issue, a senior adviser insisted the impact would be negligible: Biden\u2019s looming decision on whether to run for reelection.\u00a0 The adviser noted that Biden\u2019s two Democratic predecessors suffered midterm wipeouts, only to go on to win reelection two years later.\u00a0 But beyond that, the adviser framed it as far more about how Biden views the moment in the country and his ability to keep making progress on the issues he\u2019s pushed to enact in his first two years in office.\u00a0 Biden, of course, has said he plans to run, but no final decision has been made. He is expected to start critical meetings with family members and close advisers in the coming weeks.\u00a0 Six precincts across Georgia have been ordered by courts to remain open past 7 p.m. ET, according to Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s acting deputy secretary of state. Sterling said two polling locations in Cobb County in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs have been ordered to stay open until 7:45 p.m., two locations in DeKalb County in the Atlanta area have been ordered to stay open until 7:40 p.m. and 7:49 p.m., and two precincts in other counties will stay open until shortly after 7 p.m., when polls are scheduled to close.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sterling said that there are more than 2,600 poll locations in Georgia, and the hours were extended at these six locations because they opened late this morning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sterling said that \u201csteady turnout around the state\u201d has continued, and there have not been any major voting issues in Georgia so far.\u00a0Election Day has been \u201cwonderfully, stupendously boring,\u201d Sterling said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0 Sterling said that 2.5 million people cast ballots during early voting and they had 234,000 absentee ballots as of Monday.\u00a0 ##Voting## Former President Donald Trump, who has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0and\u00a0falsely\u00a0alleged that there was mass voter fraud in the 2020 election,\u00a0baselessly suggested on social media on Tuesday\u00a0that such fraud might be happening in the 2022 midterms. \"Same thing is happening with Voter Fraud as happened in 2020???\" Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0Tuesday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. There was\u00a0no evidence\u00a0of widespread or outcome-changing voter fraud in the 2020 election, and there was no early sign on Tuesday of any significant voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. Voter fraud typically represents a tiny fraction of ballots cast in US elections. Trump made his claim amid a series of social media posts in which he complained about assorted\u00a0technical difficulties\u00a0in some states. There was no evidence that any of these issues involved intentional malfeasance, let alone \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d Plls for all statewide races in Indiana and Kentucky close at 7 p.m. ET, but polls in some of the states\u2019 House districts are beginning to close at 6 p.m. ET. In Indiana, polls are closing in the following House\u00a0districts: 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th. In Kentucky, polls are closing in these House districts:\u00a03rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. See an hour-by-hour guide to Election Night poll closings here.  There\u2019s a significant partisan divide in voters\u2019 priorities and attitudes this year, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Nearly half of voters who supported a GOP House candidate called inflation their top issue, with fewer than 15% picking any other issue as their priority. Among voters who backed a Democratic candidate, about 44% called abortion their top issue, with 15% or fewer picking any other issue. Meanwhile,\u00a0midterm voters\u00a0were mostly opposed to the US Supreme Court decision to\u00a0overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the preliminary national exit polls. Slightly fewer than 4 in 10 said they felt enthusiastic or satisfied about the decision, while about 21% said they felt dissatisfied, and roughly 4 in 10 that they were angry. About 60% of all voters said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 51% among voters who turned out for the 2020 general election.

Twenty of the site\u2019s 60 machines were not operating at one point, though all were working by mid-morning, according to KHOU. \u201cWe\u2019re getting reports that some of our judges have had a little trouble opening their polling locations this morning,\u201d though the process was \u201csmoothing out a little bit,\u201d Harris County Elections Administrator Clifford Tatum told reporters late Tuesday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s a process as it relates to opening the voting machines and getting them set up properly, and sometimes if the proper steps aren\u2019t followed, then it may cause a couple of machines to go down. And our response is to send a technician out to those locations to get those machines back up online,\u201d Tatum said. One polling location couldn\u2019t open on time because a supplier did not deliver a key to open the machine, he said. Tatum urged voters to shift to a nearby polling site if the one they visited had long lines. Harris County residents can vote at any of the county\u2019s\u00a0782 polling places. Calls and emails to Tatum\u2019s office for comment weren\u2019t immediately returned. Harris County, Texas\u2019 most populous,\u00a0has more than 2.5 million registered voters. The county had more than 750,000 voters during early voting, and Tatum said he was \u201choping to see at least 500,000\u201d voters Tuesday. ##Voting##\u00a0 Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel raised concerns about \u201cbad actors\u201d this election season in an exclusive interview with CNN, saying the slow pace of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election could signal they won\u2019t be held accountable. Nessel noted that individuals who served as fake electors for former President Donald Trump have not been charged with any crimes. She said she referred the matter to the Justice Department because she felt it was a federal matter. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s two years later. No one\u2019s been charged,\u201d Nessel said in a wide-ranging interview on Election Day. \u201cWhat action have they taken at this point? No idea.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe problem is, if you are going to try to ensure that bad actors are held accountable, you know, you have to actually move forward with bringing charges,\u201d she added. Nessel acknowledged it can take time for DOJ to build a case. But she questioned: \u201cWhat\u2019s the incentive to comply with the law if nobody\u2019s going to prosecute you when you violate it?\u201d Nessel is running for re-election against Matthew DePerno,\u00a0a Kalamazoo attorney backed by former President Trump who has pushed his false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.\u00a0 ##Voting## Early indications suggest that\u00a0this year\u2019s midterm\u00a0electorate may look older than the voters in the 2018 midterms, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Only about a tenth of voters in this election were under age 30, while roughly one-third were age 65 or older. In 2018, about 13% were under 30, and about 26% were 65 or older. The electorate this year was split roughly between those who generally identify as Democrats (about 34%) and those who generally identify as Republicans (about 35%), with the remainder consisting of political independents and members of other parties. In 2018, Democrats made up a slightly larger voting bloc, about 37%. About 76% of voters were White, and about 24% were voters of color. White voters with college degrees look to be a slightly larger share of the electorate this year \u2013 about 40% per the preliminary data, compared with 31% four years ago. By contrast, voters of color without a college degree look to have made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate this year. ##Analysis## Inflation tops voters\u2019 list of concerns in this year\u2019s midterm elections, with abortion a close second, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Approximately one-third called inflation the most important issue to their vote, with about 27% citing abortion. The remainder were roughly divided between picking crime, gun policy and immigration as their chief concerns. The electorate\u2019s views of the economy are largely gloomy. Only about one-quarter of voters felt positively about the current condition of the economy, with roughly three-quarters viewing it negatively \u2013 and about 4 in 10 saying it\u2019s downright poor. That\u2019s more pessimistic than in the 2018 midterms when 68% of voters said the state of the economy was excellent or good, and the 2020 presidential election, when 49% said the same. About 46% of voters in this election say that their family\u2019s financial situation had worsened over the past two years, while only about 1 in 5 said it had improved. More than three-quarters of voters in this year\u2019s election say that inflation has caused hardship for them and their family over the past year, with about 20% saying it\u2019s been a severe hardship. And about 6 in 10 say that gas prices, specifically, have recently been a hardship. ##Analysis## At least three poll workers\u00a0in\u00a0Tulsa\u00a0County\u2019s\u00a0Precinct 77\u00a0were relieved of their duties Tuesday after\u00a0authorities received\u00a0reports that they were not handing out city council ballots\u00a0to certain voters, Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado said in a news conference.\u00a0\u00a0 The Oklahoma county sheriff said he received video with allegations that poll workers were not giving the city council\u00a0ballot\u00a0to Republican voters\u00a0on Tuesday morning\u00a0and that \u201cthey were only being given to Democrats, Independents and Libertarians.\u201d\u00a0 The Tulsa County Election Board received a report about the incident at roughly 7:45 a.m. local time, contacted poll workers to instruct them they were supposed to\u00a0give\u00a0city council ballots\u00a0along with the state ballots to\u00a0voters\u00a0and \u201cthey began handing out the city council ballots\u00a0...\u00a0at 8 a.m.,\u201d said Gwen Freeman,\u00a0the election board secretary.\u00a0The\u00a0poll workers were relieved of their duties and new poll workers\u00a0were assigned, Freeman\u00a0said.\u00a0A total of about 30 to 40 people who voted in the morning were impacted, Freeman said. \u201cWe sincerely hope this does not have any significant effect on the outcome of this election,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s\u00a0a number of\u00a0ballots that could potentially affect the outcome of the election, then the appropriate remedy would be for the affected candidate to file an irregularity by 5 p.m. on Friday.\u201d\u00a0 Detectives interviewed the poll workers\u00a0at the precinct and confirmed the\u00a0city council\u00a0ballots were only being handed out to Democrat and\u00a0Independent voters\u00a0Tuesday morning, the sheriff said.\u00a0The voters who were denied a city council ballot\u00a0include 19 Republicans, seven Democrats, four Independents and one\u00a0Libertarian,\u00a0Freeman said.\u00a0Poll workers cannot determine a voter's party affiliation unless they ask, \"which is the irregularity and where the problem exists. And that is what happened,\" the sheriff said. The poll workers relieved of their duties included one Republican and two Democrats, among them the polling judge who was\u00a0in charge of\u00a0giving other poll workers instructions, Regalado added.\u00a0 One of the poll workers\u00a0said they were aware of the mistake but said they were following the orders of the polling judge\u00a0who also confirmed the mistake,\u00a0the\u00a0sheriff\u00a0said.\u00a0But poll workers all receive training and are required to sign paperwork confirming they understand the rules of the\u00a0voting\u00a0process,\u00a0Regalado said.\u00a0 \u201cThe information that we have received does indicate that there\u00a0[were]\u00a0voter irregularities, we \u2026 are in the process of putting together this investigation to hand to the district attorney\u2019s office for consideration of charges,\u201d the sheriff said. Those charges could potentially be impeding the voting process and/or\u00a0intentionally impeding the voting process by fraudulent measures, he said. \u201cThat\u00a0will be up to the district attorney to decide which charges are going to be filed, if any at all.\u201d\u00a0 ##Voting## Voters are casting ballots across the country today to determine control of the House and Senate and 36 governor races. Take a look at some of the more unique polling places where voters went on Tuesday. Today\u2019s the day when voters will make their voices heard \u2013 and the composition of the next Congress is expected to be determined in states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin.\u00a0 CNN Political Director David Chalian spoke to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean, Jeff Zeleny, Kyung Lah and Omar Jimenez who have all been following the key gubernatorial and Senate races in those four states for months.\u00a0 Listen to this special edition of the CNN Political Briefing podcast to hear how the campaigns spent the final days, and what issues matter most to voters.\u00a0 ##Analysis## Maricopa County elections officials said that every vote would be counted, despite earlier tabulation issues that arose from a printer problem at about 60 vote centers. \u201cThere was no one who came today with a valid ID who was turned away from the polls,\u201d Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman Bill Gates told reporters Tuesday afternoon. \u201cEven when we had this [issue] and we hadn\u2019t figured out the solution, people were still able to vote. It was just a matter of maybe not voting in the way they wanted to.\u201d Gates said that people whose votes couldn\u2019t be run through the tabulator were still given a ballot. They then had two options: Either dropping that in a box labeled \u201cBox No. 3,\u201d which he said will later be run through the county\u2019s central tabulation system or having the option of going to another voting center in the county. The problem impacted about 60 of the county\u2019s 223 voting centers, Gates said. It was a printer issue rather than a tabulator issue, he said.\u00a0 As of Tuesday afternoon, Arizona time, about 40 centers were still experiencing problems but were being fixed by technicians, Gates added. Maricopa county\u2019s elections chief, recorder Stephen Richer, tweeted a statement in which he apologized for the issues. \u201cEvery legal vote will be tabulated. I promise,\u201d Richer said in his statement.\u00a0 ##Voting## Voters in this year\u2019s midterms are broadly unhappy with the state of the nation and hold largely negative views of President Joe Biden, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\u00a0 More than 7 in 10 said they were less than satisfied with the way things are going in the country, with about one-third saying they were not just dissatisfied but angry with the state of the nation. Biden\u2019s approval rating stands at about 45% among voters in this year\u2019s election \u2013 nearly identical to then-Donald Trump\u2019s 45% approval rating four years ago among 2018 midterm voters. And voters in this election were more than twice as likely to strongly disapprove of Biden as they were to strongly approve of him. Just shy of half of the voters said that Biden\u2019s policies are mostly hurting the country, with about 36% saying his policies are mostly helping, and the rest that they\u2019re making no difference. Many voters didn\u2019t see their congressional vote as a referendum on the president \u2013 close to half said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, while about 18% said their vote was to express support for Biden, and about one-third that it was to express opposition to him.

CNN's David Chalian breaks down Biden's approval rating here: ##Analysis## Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, has\u00a0tweeted\u00a0to debunk a prominent Republican personality\u2019s false Election Day claim about voting wait times. This comes after Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of right-wing group Turning Point USA,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Tuesday to his 1.8 million followers: \u201c2 hour wait minimum at most polling places in Maricopa. Democrats running elections here knew this would happen. Traffic jam by design. DONT LET THEM DO 2020 AGAIN. WAIT IN LINE AND VOTE.\u201d The tweet was thoroughly inaccurate. Maricopa County\u2019s elections aren\u2019t run by Democrats: its elections chief,\u00a0Recorder Stephen Richer, and its Board of Supervisors chairman,\u00a0Bill Gates, are both Republicans. And the county\u2019s online wait-times\u00a0tracker\u00a0showed\u00a0that dozens of voting locations there had waits of under five minutes, including many with no waits at all. County voters are permitted to cast their ballots at\u00a0whatever location they choose.\u00a0 Maricopa County\u00a0said\u00a0in its tweet in response to Kirk\u2019s tweet: \u201cNo part of the tweet below is accurate. The vast majority of Vote Centers are seeing wait times under 30 minutes, and whether by tabulator or secure ballot box, all voters are being served.\u201d Maricopa County did experience Election Day technical\u00a0problems\u00a0with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, according to county officials on Tuesday morning. The problem prompted officials to\u00a0ask affected voters\u00a0to place their ballot in a secure box for counting, wait for the tabulator problems to be resolved, or go vote at another county location.\u00a0(Richer issued an afternoon\u00a0statement\u00a0saying the Board of Supervisors had identified the problem and had \u201cbegun fixing affected voting locations.\u201d He promised that \u201cevery legal vote will be tabulated.\u201d) But there was no indication of intentional malfeasance. ##Voting## It\u2019s the most closely watched, most expensive, perhaps most consequential Senate race in the country. and as the vote comes in for the Pennsylvania Senate race tonight, one John Fetterman campaign source describes the race as a \u201cjump ball,\u201d telling CNN the team for the Democratic candidate is confident they closed out the race as strongly as they possibly could. \u201cPennsylvania is Pennsylvania, but we feel like we\u2019ve done everything we can,\u201d a second campaign source told CNN.\u00a0 The first source pointed to strong crowd attendance at a rally in a Philadelphia suburb last week despite the fact the Phillies and Eagles were both playing as the beginning of \u201cFetterman strikes back.\u201d  That was followed by an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey on Friday in which she chose Fetterman over his Republican challenger Dr. Mehmet Oz, a man she made a household name. The Winfrey endorsement may have the most effect where he needed it \u2013 with suburban women, according to two campaign sources. One source told CNN they believe there will be an \"Oprah effect.\"\u00a0 On Saturday, Fetterman appeared with former President Barack Obama for rallies in Democratic strongholds, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, with President Joe Biden joining the Philadelphia event.\u00a0 \u201cThe news cycles we\u2019ve been through in the past couple days were really solid for us,\u201d a source added.\u00a0 And critically, the campaign believes Oz undercut his closing message of rejecting extremism by appearing on stage with former President Donald Trump and at the same rally as Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. However, the Oz campaign believes its closing message on the contrast of balance and extremism puts them in a good position in the race. A source tells CNN they believe that message resonated with voters and helped define Fetterman in a way that stuck with voters. The Republican candidate's campaign is feeling confident as it waits for the votes to be counted in Pennsylvania, believing it closed out the election on a high note with a large crowd in the Philadelphia suburbs Monday night. Both campaigns are, however, very aware and prepared for the vote count to come in slowly and knows it could take days to determine a winner. ##Senate## All the Arizona campaigns are telling aides and CNN the same thing: Tonight requires patience. A source familiar with GOP Senate candidate Blake Masters\u2019 campaign thinking said that while his team is tracking the Election Day turnout numbers carefully, they won\u2019t know anything until the first release of numbers at 8 p.m. local time. A campaign source for Democrat Mark Kelly noted that \u201cwho is ahead tonight may not win.\u201d The so-called \"late earlies\" \u2014 mail-in ballots dropped off in person \u2014 will be\u00a0a key factor they are watching\u00a0in determining a winner, and that may take time to count. A spokesperson for Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Katie Hobbs reiterated what the Arizona secretary of state has said on the trail: that the campaign is prepared for a recount. A spokesman for Republican Kari Lake's gubernatorial campaign said they \"always expected to be down on initial drop due to the drop that Kari Lake voters are voting in person today.\u201d Former President Trump, whose shadow is long across Arizona\u2019s Trump-endorsed candidates, is boosting Lake, his most devoted supporter in the battleground state. Lake spokesperson Colton Duncan confirmed that she spoke with Trump twice today. \u201cBoth the president and Mrs. Lake have teams closely monitoring the issues in Maricopa County. Spirits are high, enthusiasm is off the charts and our win will be huge. President Trump ended the phone call with \u2018Go get \u2018em, girl!\u2019\u201d he said.  Maricopa County election officials said 20% of the polling places in the county experienced an issue with the tabulators, with some of the ballots not going through the machines.\u00a0By 10 a.m. MT, county officials said the problems were being addressed and that they did not anticipate delays in voting. By the afternoon, Maricopa County elections officials said they identified a solution for the tabulation issues that occurred at about 60 voting centers.\u00a0 ##Voting##  Maricopa County elections officials said Tuesday afternoon they have identified a solution for earlier tabulation issues that occurred at about 60 voting centers.\u00a0 \u201cCounty technicians have changed the printer settings, which seems to have resolved this issue,\u201d the county\u2019s elections department said in a statement. The county said some of the printers at voting locations were \u201cnot producing dark enough timing marks on the ballots.\u201d The elections office said changing the printer settings has so far worked at 17 voting locations and technicians across the county are working to fix printer settings at the remaining locations. ##Voting## Democratic Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan\u2019s camp said they\u2019re seeing high turnout from the cities and suburbs, which a campaign source called a \u201cpromising\u201d sign for the Democratic representative running for Senate.  The source also said they\u2019ve been encouraged and excited by hearing anecdotes on the ground of Republicans who have crossed party lines to vote for Ryan, which he will need in order to claim victory here in the Ohio. Ryan himself continues to express optimism about the race, texting CNN: \u201cGonna win.\u201d Meanwhile, the JD Vance campaign also says they\u2019re feeling good and have seen \u201ca lot of great energy\u201d on the ground, with a campaign source saying voter turnout has been coming \u201cin droves across the board in key areas.\u201d \u201cJD is looking forward to a resounding victory tonight,\u201d the campaign source added.\u00a0 ##Senate## President Biden has spent the day behind closed doors, checking in regularly with his political team, which is set up in the building across from the West Wing.\u00a0 He\u2019s made calls to top Democratic officials, both to thank them for their work and to ply them for info about what they\u2019re seeing.\u00a0 Biden\u2019s very aware there is no pathway to hold onto the House, but he has asked about specific House Democrats he campaigned for, one advisor said. He does, however, remain optimistic they can hold onto the Senate \u2013 even as he\u2019s aware it may take several days \u2014 or longer due to a possible Georgia runoff \u2014 to know for sure.\u00a0 One thing advisers are assured of based on their conversations with Biden: regardless of how the night goes, he remains steadfast in his administration\u2019s agenda and direction. There is no pivot, there is no shift. It\u2019s full speed ahead.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of the reason Biden\u2019s advisors circulated a polling memo this afternoon to top allies highlighting what they view as evidence that Biden\u2019s agenda remains largely popular in isolation. They\u2019re very aware the blame game is about to commence in a major way \u2013 and are working to insulate the president from the arrows that will be flying in the days ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 Polls will remain open for one extra hour in Bell County, Texas, because of technical difficulties with check-in machines, the county\u2019s public information officer said in a press release Tuesday afternoon.\u00a0 The Bell County Elections Administrator asked the county attorney to petition a district court judge to issue a court order for polls to stay open. Judge Jack Jones, of the 146th judicial district, ordered polling hours be extended until 8 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to the court order.\u00a0\u00a0 This morning, check-in machines at eight of the county\u2019s 42 voting centers were not working due to synchronization issues tied to Sunday\u2019s time change, Bell County Public Information Officer James Stafford told CNN Tuesday morning.\u00a0 \"This issue led to delays in the opening of those facilities and long waits for some voters,\u201d Stafford said in a press release Tuesday afternoon. \u201cTo ensure that every Bell County voter is given the opportunity to cast their ballot, the Bell County Elections Office has requested and been allowed to extend voting hours county-wide until 8:00 p.m.\u201d Polling results will be delayed this evening as a result of this, the release said.\u00a0Bell County is in central Texas and includes Killeen, Texas.\u00a0 ##Voting## A man was arrested Tuesday afternoon after threatening voters with a knife in a Milwaukee suburb, briefly forcing one polling place to close. Police in West Bend, Wisconsin, responded at about 12:35 p.m. CT to a report of a man armed with a knife at West Bend Community Memorial Library, which is a polling location. The man demanded that staff \u201cstop the voting,\u201d the West Bend Police Department said in a press release.\u00a0 The 38-year-old man, who was not immediately identified by authorities, was arrested without incident, and no injuries were reported, police said. Voting at the polling site stopped for just more than 30 minutes while officers investigated, the police said, but the location has since reopened. Police said that \u201ccharges will be forthcoming.\u201d ##Voting## Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he expects that many counties across the state should be able to report results quicker and earlier than they have historically due to the state voting bill passed in 2021. Improvements in SB 202 have clarified that county election officials can begin pre-processing and early tabulation of all ballots, including all early voting and absentee ballots, before polls close at 7 p.m. local time on Tuesday, he said at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe'll be updating every 10 minutes for a period of time, and we'll be getting those results out as soon we can, because we know that voters want to see those results as quick as possible,\u201d Raffensperger said.\u00a0 Roughly one-third of the state\u2019s 159 counties are participating in early tabulation, including most of the largely populated counties in Atlanta and the Atlanta suburbs, according to state election officials.\u00a0\u00a0Any precinct\u00a0election officials who are involved with tabulating will be sequestered at their county office until polls close to prevent information leaks. Turnout across Georgia continues to be extremely strong on Election Day,\u00a0Raffensperger said, adding that the average wait time to vote has been roughly two minutes across the state so far.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat we are really seeing has been an election that has been very calm and quiet and smooth,\u201d he added. ##Voting## \u00a0An outage earlier Tuesday of the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s website has been resolved, and there is no evidence it was caused by malicious activity, Nevada officials said.\u00a0 \u201cThe outage did not alter or disrupt our plans for Election Night Reporting,\u201d the elections division of Nevada\u2019s secretary of state\u00a0tweeted Tuesday\u00a0afternoon after voters inquired about the website being offline.\u00a0 The outage was due to a technical issue, IT administrators said in a report that the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s office shared with CNN. \u201cOnce the cause was determined, service was manually restored through the device\u2019s backup and the state is now back online,\u201d the report said. \u201cService will be restored through the primary firewall after the conclusion of the election.\u201d If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know to get up to speed on the state of the midterms race and what to watch for next. What's at stake: The 2022 midterm elections will decide control of Congress, dozens of statewide positions and ballot measures on key issues in many states. Take a look at CNN's hour-by-hour guide on when polls close for each state. What the results could mean for America: At every election, candidates tell voters that this is the most critical election of their lifetimes. This time they may be right. A Republican wave would sweep in scores of candidates who swear by ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The former President would likely weaponize a Republican-controlled House against Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential vote; Rep. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 who would likely become Republican Speaker if Republicans win \u2013 has not ruled out impeaching Biden, despite the absence of any evidence that he\u2019s committed an impeachable offense. A surprise Democratic victory would allow Biden to build upon his social, health, and climate change legislation, and to balance out the judiciary with liberal judges after four years of Trump\u2019s conservative picks. Joining us from abroad? If you're following the US midterm elections from another part of the world, read this helpful guide on what to know and what to watch. What to look for tonight: Watch Harry Enten's quick explainer ahead of Election Night to get up to speed: House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and his team have been working on a victory speech for the last couple of weeks as he remains extremely confident that they will take back the House tonight.  While he has prepared remarks, he's expected to riff a bit as well. His team expects he may take the stage in the 11 p.m. ET hour if the night goes as they expect.  It's expected that Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and potentially former House Speaker Newt Gingrich could speak as well.\u00a0 McCarthy has raised an enormous amount of money and stumped in about 40 states in the last few months \u2014 even as late as last night and today for two House challengers in Virginia, Jen Kiggans and Hung Cao, who Republicans believe will help them take back the majority.  The goal for Team McCarthy: Picking up at least 20 seats. If they clear that bar, they will consider it a very good night, giving them a comfortable governing majority. If the party picks up fewer, Republicans won't be view tonight as strong of a showing as they hoped. which could spell problems for getting their agenda through Congress. ##House## There have been\u00a0isolated\u00a0incidents of e-poll books going down in Detroit, Michigan, according to Jake Rollow, a spokesperson for Michigan Department of State. Rollow explained: E-poll books are laptops that have a static download of the voter registration list. When voters arrive at their polling place, election workers check them in on an e-poll book to ensure they're registered, in the right precinct, and haven't already voted absentee.\u00a0Polling sites have hardcopy paper backups to check in voters. Rollow said he has heard a \"couple reports\" that e-poll books in Detroit have gone down, but \"not that many.\" Detroit NAACP sent a notice saying there are some polling locations that are \"experiencing computer glitches,\" but reminded voters to stay in line because they can still check in via a backup paper poll book and vote with paper ballots. Kristina Karamo, the GOP nominee for Michigan Secretary of State,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0misinformation on Tuesday, claiming that there was \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201ccrime\u201d in Detroit because some voters who showed up to their precincts were told they already voted absentee. Former President Donald Trump already picked up Karamo\u2019s claim, and said on his Truth Social account, \u201cthe absentee ballot situation in Detroit is REALLY BAD. People are showing up to Vote only to be told, \u201csorry, you have already voted.\u201d This is happening in large numbers, elsewhere as well. Protest, Protest, Protest.\u201d But remember: Rollow from the Michigan Secretary of State\u2019s office has already addressed this and said the issue had already been resolved. Every precinct should have a paper backup of the voter registration list in case there are issues with the e-poll book, Rollow said. \"It obviously could take a bit longer just to look somebody up on paper rather than looking them up on your computer, but it shouldn't impact a voter's ability to vote in any way.\" \"There's no reason to expect that it would be, you know, taking place more broadly or in any way, you know, connected across jurisdictions,\" Rollow said, adding that officials would look into the issue to make sure. As of 8 a.m. local time this morning, 2,016,147 absentee ballots had been requested in Michigan, and 1,716,264 had been submitted, Rollow added. ##Voting## Polls in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, will stay open until 10 p.m. ET tonight, per an order from county judge Lesa S. Gelb. In the order, Gelb said voters in the county were \u201cdisenfranchised and denied the fundamental right to vote \u2026 through no fault of their own.\u201d Attorneys petitioning for the extension of time cited a paper shortage at polling locations, that ultimately resulted in the inability to print paper ballots and necessitated the use of emergency and provisional ballots, resulting in delays for voters. The judge ordered that all election officials be immediately alerted to the extended voting hours. Luzerne County is located in Northeast Pennsylvania, and encompasses Wilkes-Barre, the county\u2019s largest city. ##Voting## The North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to allow three polling precincts to close an hour later in North Carolina after their opening was delayed on Election Day. Wilson County's Sanoca Fire Station, the\u00a0Gaddys\u00a0Community Building polling precinct\u00a0in\u00a0Robeson County and\u00a0the Ransom precinct in Columbus County will all close at 8:30 p.m. ET, the board voted.\u00a0 Voters would vote with provisional ballot after 7:30 p.m. ET, said the board during a meeting Tuesday on the issue. We're \"talking about less than a half dozen precincts today and there's over 2,600 precincts here in North Carolina. So, what we're about to do is just to make sure that polling places are open no more and no less than the statutory. The statutes require us,\" said Damon Circosta, chair of the North Carolina Board of Elections ahead of the vote. Extending the closing \"offers consistency amongst all three of those precincts and it makes sure that we're not staying. Keeping our election workers there so terribly late at night, so it's balancing the needs of the voters with the needs of election administration,\" said the chair. The\u00a0Gaddys\u00a0Community Building polling place in Robeson County \"opened approximately one hour late because the building was locked and the voters did not have the correct access code to enter the building,\" North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) Executive Director\u00a0Karen Brinson Bell said.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Additionally, three sites in Columbus County were delayed in opening due to the check-in computers not being connected properly to the printers and therefore the workers were unable to print the voters' authorization to vote forms,\" she said.\u00a0 NCSBE will\u00a0start releasing initial results at approximately 7:30 p.m. ET for all counties where the polls close at that time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In all less than 45 voters were impacted and several returned or were offered provisional ballots, according to the board.\u00a0 ##Voting##\u00a0 An extra verification process to ensure voters didn\u2019t vote both by mail and in person could delay counting ballots and getting election results in Philadelphia, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go as fast as we can go; I don\u2019t think anybody knows yet\u201d when the count will be done, Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the commissioners\u2019 office told CNN.\u00a0 Philadelphia elections officials have received around 120,000 mail-in ballots so far \u2014 a much smaller number than the over 350,000 mail-in ballots they counted during the 2020 general election, Feeley said, adding that means it will likely not take as long to count and verify the votes as the 2020 election did. Some background: Delays could happen because the city commissioners voted Tuesday morning for elections officials to do what\u2019s known as a \u201creconciliation process\u201d during the Election Day count \u2013 where elections officials check to make sure voters who voted by mail also didn\u2019t show up to vote in person. Other counties do the reconciliation process after votes are tallied. \u201cThat\u2019s probably going to be sometime tomorrow, the reconciliation,\u201d Feeley told CNN. \u201cAnd that impacts when we\u2019re finished. We\u2019re going to go as fast as we can go; we\u2019re going to have shifts working around the clock.\u201d ##Voting## Voters head to the polls Tuesday to elect federal and state leaders in the 2022 Midterm elections. Here are some scenes showing voters casting their ballots and polling workers and volunteers working the voting precincts across the country. ##Voting## An apparent cyberattack on the website of the clerk of Champaign County, Illinois, caused a brief delay in the clerk\u2019s ability\u00a0to access their registration information\u00a0on Tuesday morning but did not prevent anyone from voting, County Clerk Aaron Ammons told CNN. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had to turn anyone away,\u201d Ammons said, adding that the issue had been mitigated by early Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the inability for certain sites to pull up our voter registration program. It would give us an error message on connectivity.\u201d It\u2019s unclear who was responsible for the apparent hack. Ammon said his IT team has been fending off hacks for the last month that try to knock their website offline. Voters should know that their ability to cast a ballot has not affected by the incident, he added. Champaign County is in east central Illinois. \u201cPlease stay in line!\u201d Champaign County said on its Facebook page. \u201cElection judges and staff are doing everything they can to process voters according to the requirements of election law while navigating these attacks.\"\u00a0 The incident is an example of the unpredictable events on Election Day that federal, state and local officials have long been drilling for. Local government websites are not involved in tallying votes but typically provide voting information to the public. At a briefing with reporters Tuesday, CISA officials said they hadn\u2019t heard about the apparent attack but would look into it.\u00a0 ##Voting## As Democrats brace for midterm losses, the intra-party blame is game set to boil over in the weeks ahead, prompting the White House to separate President Joe Biden and his agenda from the list of targets.\u00a0 The White House circulated an Election Day memo to allies underscoring that more than two dozen individual poll results demonstrate the popularity of the key individual elements of Biden\u2019s agenda, ranging from his cornerstone legislative achievements to his actions on student loans, marijuana and his administration\u2019s response to Covid-19. \u201cBefore all the votes have even been cast, pundits are declaring that these midterms have been a referendum on the President\u2019s agenda \u2013 nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d the memo, which was obtained by CNN, says in its introduction. Yet even Biden has acknowledged that his agenda, no matter how it polls in isolation, hasn\u2019t translated to an American public that has taken a largely negative view on the direction of the country.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve passed so many good things ... people haven\u2019t realized how good they are yet,\u201d he said at a fundraising event last week. The effort to get in front of expected losses comes after months of frontline Democratic candidates actively seeking to separate themselves from Biden. It\u2019s a reality advisors say Biden doesn\u2019t take personally. After 36 years in the Senate, Biden\u2019s view has long been that the candidates know what\u2019s best for their state or district. But as Biden\u2019s approval ratings started to inch up in the last few months, White House officials have bristled at the view that he was a singular drag on Democrats.\u00a0 Instead, they have pointed to the combination of history and economic headwinds. Nearly all of Biden\u2019s recent predecessors that one-party control of Washington faced major midterm losses. The fact Americans have faced persistent inflation near four-decade highs only compounds the political difficulty.\u00a0 Election Day voting in Wisconsin is going smoothly, without any significant problems, said Wisconsin\u2019s top election official Tuesday. \u201cAs of this afternoon, there are no major issues that have been reported,\u201d Meagan Wolfe, the nonpartisan administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said at a press conference. \u201cElection Day in Wisconsin is going smoothly.\u201d The commission had received some \u201cvery minor reports earlier today of lines at the polling places around the state,\u201d as well as \u201croutine calls and questions,\u201d Wolfe added. Polls in the state close at 8 p.m. central time, and those waiting in line at the time can still vote, Wolfe reminded voters.\u00a0\u00a0 As of Tuesday morning, voters had requested about 815,000 absentee ballots and returned about 742,000 of them, including about 318,000 in-person absentee ballots, she noted. Acknowledging that some jurisdictions could take until Wednesday morning to complete their tallies of absentee ballots, Wolfe said, \u201celection officials are always going to value accuracy over speed.\u201d \u201cThere are observers in that same room until the very last ballot is counted,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThere really is no part of the election administration process that\u2019s done behind a locked door.\u201d ##Voting## A video of an election official explaining a problem with vote tabulations outside a polling location in Maricopa County, Arizona, earlier Tuesday morning is spreading on social media, clocking up millions of views. The video, which was posted by a Republican activist, has already been viewed more than 2.5 million times on Twitter. The clip is\u00a0largely being amplified by right-wing personalities,\u00a0some of whom are claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that the machine issues are a sign of fraud.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve anticipated legitimate mistakes and issues with election infrastructure being reframed as fraud,\" Kate Starbird, an associate professor at the University of Washington who studies the spread of disinformation, told CNN.\u00a0 The video shows an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining a problem with tabulation machines rejecting ballots.\u00a0 Election officials quickly responded, saying they were working on the issue and that voters whose ballots were not being accepted by a tabulation machine could put their ballot in a secure box and they would be counted after the polls close.\u00a0 \u201cNo one is being disenfranchised. And none of this indicates any fraud or anything of that sort. This is a technical issue,\u201d said Bill Gates, chairman of the county\u2019s Board of Supervisors and a Republican himself.\u00a0 A county spokeswoman added that the poll worker in the viral video did what they were supposed to. \u201cThat poll worker at Anthem was doing their job, providing voters the information they need to participate in this election, and the options they have. He was calm and transparent,\u201d said Megan Gilbertson of the county\u2019s election department.\u00a0 CNN's Bob Ortega\u00a0contributed to this reporting Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff stopped at John O\u2019Groats restaurant on Election Day, joining Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rep. Karen Bass to greet diners inside.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s Election Day, so please do vote,\u201d the vice president said to a table. \u201cOh you voted, thank you for voting,\u201d she said to another table. At one point, when the vice president entered the second room of the restaurant, a woman stood up and pointed to an \u201cI voted\u201d sticker on her chest, prompting Harris to cheer. \u201cRemind everybody you know about the stakes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cLots at stake.\u201d\u00a0 Harris and Emhoff went around taking photos with diners, and Emhoff was overheard telling one diner to \u201cget the pancakes.\u201d The vice president ordered two dozen biscuits, saying, \u201cI am not playing around with biscuits\u201d and joking that Emhoff could have only one. She got butter and jam on the side before going into the kitchen to thank the cooks. The voting hours at two precincts in Cobb County, Georgia, were extended by a state court judge after the election sites opened later than expected Tuesday morning. One precinct will be open until 7:06 p.m. ET and another will be open to 7:45 p.m. ET, according to the Cobb County government website, which said the hours were extended by\u00a0Superior Court Judge Gregory Poole. ##Voting## Poll workers across Michigan are reporting higher voter turnout than expected, said Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow.\u00a0 \"We're just hearing from election workers across the state that they're pleasantly surprised by how many people are showing up to vote in person,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Rollow said he still expects all ballots will be counted by 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday, which is within 24 hours of polls closing.\u00a0 As of 11:30 a.m. local time today,\u00a02,018,929\u00a0absentee ballots had been requested in Michigan, and\u00a01,758,987\u00a0had been submitted, according to Rollow. As of 12:30 p.m. today, there were 3,666 same-day registrations across the state, he said.\u00a0 ##Voting## A mother and son were removed as poll workers in Johns Creek, Georgia, minutes before polls opened this morning, after a social media post surfaced showing them attending the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\u00a0 \u201cI stood up for what\u2019s right today in Washington DC. This election was a sham. Mike Pence is a traitor. I was tear gassed FOUR times. I have pepper spray in my throat. I stormed the Capitol building. And my children have had the best learning experience of their lives,\u201d one Facebook post shared with CNN by state election officials read.\u00a0 \u201cI am aware that it occurred. That really is a Fulton County internal issue. They have to mitigate the risk the way they see fit given that information,\u201d said Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office, when asked about it by CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cI think it would have been better if they found out earlier potentially and worked with the people, but since it was so last minute and it came to light so late, I leave it to Fulton County. But yes, that did happen earlier this morning,\u201d Sterling said.\u00a0 The social media post is under \u201cinvestigation for concern,\u201d Nadine Williams, Fulton County interim director of registration and elections, said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cWe decided to remove them until we could complete the investigation,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0 \u201cWe just want to make sure the election is secure,\u201d she added.\u00a0 Social media posts and a comment made during a poll worker event was brought to the Fulton County board\u2019s attention by a peer. Williams said the secretary of state\u2019s office was consulted on the matter, and the state office agreed that there was a concern.\u00a0 Williams said she was not at liberty to comment on the nature of the social media post when asked by a reporter, but she confirmed that it included a threat about election security. \u201cThere were some things in there that were not allowed. You cannot take videos or photos in the election. That\u2019s what brought it to our attention,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0 ##Voting## In eight US states, voters are sent a mail-in ballot automatically. Across the US, more than half of states require that mail-in ballots be received by Election Day. In 19 states, ballots can be counted if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.  ##Voting## The five most expensive Senate races of 2022 have seen nearly $1.3 billion in spending across the primary and general elections, according to OpenSecrets, a staggering sum that speaks to the massive amounts of money flooding the political system. Leading the way is the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz are squaring off in the general election. All told, nearly $375 million has been spent on the race this cycle, OpenSecrets found.\u00a0 Here's how the other races in the top five stack up in terms of total spending:\u00a0 Pennsylvania: $373,605,258\nGeorgia: $271,351,786\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArizona: $234,577,515\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWisconsin: $205,791,615\nOhio: $202,117,075\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pennsylvania was also the most expensive Senate race of the 2016 cycle, when Republican Pat Toomey was running for reelection. Total spending in that race was around $179 million, according to OpenSecrets \u2014 less than half the amount spent on the 2022 contest. What numbers like these suggest is that attempts \u2014 earlier this century \u2014 to lessen the impact of money in politics have failed utterly. There is more money than ever before, and it's difficult to track where some of the money, spent by nonprofit groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, comes from. ##Analysis## ##Senate## Gabriel Sterling, chief operating offer for Georgia's secretary of state's office, says voter turnout across the Peach State has been \"steady,\" although it's hard to \"it's always difficult to know\u00a0in the middle of the day how\u00a0it's going.\" Majority of polling locations have no lines, with average wait time of about two minutes, he told CNN Tuesday. \"It's been a very\u00a0efficient process.\" Sterling also pointed to the record number of absentee ballots received in Georgia. It stands at about 234,000 ballots as of this morning, which is up from 2018's record of 213,0000 ballots, he said, adding that it takes a lot of pressure off officials when they start counting. \"We set records for early vote\u00a0turnout.\u00a0Between early vote and absentee\u00a0\u2014 and absentee set a new record as\u00a0of this morning of 234,000 for a\u00a0midterm.\u00a0That really takes away pressure\u00a0off Election Day, because ... when we start today, nearly\u00a037% of all our active voters had\u00a0already cast a ballot,\" he said. Sterling said that new laws passed in Georgia clarified that early in-person votes and absentee votes can be tabulated early, \"which will hopefully get\u00a0us some earlier returns in the 7:15,\u00a07:45 and 8:00 hour from even some of our larger\u00a0counties.\" Watch: Poll workers are keeping Americans voting on Election Day. Take a look at some photos from today showing poll workers keeping poll locations going.  Wall Street is confident the midterm election will lead to gridlock in Washington, but traders say this week\u2019s inflation report may prove to be far more consequential to markets. Markets have rallied in recent days as investors bet Republicans will take control of at least one chamber of commerce, leading to divided government. Traders typically believe gridlock is good \u2013 because it means one party can\u2019t push through legislation that messes things up. In this case, that means Republicans can\u2019t enact unfunded tax cuts and Democrats can\u2019t push through unfunded spending programs, both of which would worsen inflation and lift interest rates. \u201cLess government, complete gridlock, will probably benefit the stock market,\u201d Peter Tuchman, a veteran New York Stock Exchange floor trader, told CNN on Tuesday. If Republicans win control of at least the House of Representatives, markets may have a \u201cmuted\u201d reaction because that is widely expected, Goldman Sachs told clients in a report Monday. Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel, warned that a surprisingly strong night for Democrats that allows them to retain control of both the House and Senate would cause a \u201cmeaningful move lower\u201d for stocks.\u00a0 Multiple NYSE traders told CNN that the midterm election may be overshadowed by Thursday\u2019s consumer price index, an inflation gauge that has become arguably the most important economic metric of the month. Maricopa County, Arizona, officials said that tabulating machines at about a fifth of their 223 voting locations were rejecting ballots as voting got underway on Election Day.\u00a0\u00a0 According to county officials, the problem related to passwords being entered too many times, activating built-in security features. By 10 a.m. local time, county officials said the problems were being addressed and that they did not anticipate delays in voting. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 20% of the locations out there where there\u2019s an issue with the tabulator where some of the ballots, after people have voted them, they try and run them through the tabulator and they\u2019re not going through,\u201d said Bill Gates, chair of the county\u2019s Board of Supervisors.\u00a0 Gates said the elections division was\u00a0working to fix the problem, but that in the meantime voters could put ballots that aren\u2019t properly read into a secure box on the tabulator machine.  Gates said that bipartisan teams will bring the ballots to the county\u2019s election center, where they will be counted after the polls close at 7 p.m. local time.  \u201cNo one is being disenfranchised. And none of this indicates any fraud or anything of that sort. This is a technical issue,\u201d said Gates.\u00a0 The tabulator problems\u00a0blew up on social media and right-wing media after a post showing an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters. Figures like Donald Trump Jr., among others, reposted tweets raising concerns about problems in Arizona and in some cases suggesting it meant that the election might be \u201cstolen.\u201d \u00a0 Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, expressed disappointment rather than surprise at the notion the problems were being misrepresented in such a fashion. \u00a0 \u201cObviously, some people will exploit it for that purpose,\u201d Richer said. \"We\u2019re very concerned about that.\u201d\u00a0 A county spokeswoman added that the poll worker featured in the viral video did what they were supposed to. \u201cThat poll worker at Anthem was doing their job, providing voters the information they need to participate in this election, and the options they have. He was calm and transparent,\u201d said Megan Gilbertson of the county\u2019s election department.\u00a0 Hear more from CNN's Sara Sidner:   ##Voting## In a public appearance at a political event in Suffolk County, New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin talked about his plans to tackle crime in the state and how his approach differs from that of his competitor, Gov. Kathy Hochul.\u00a0 Zeldin took a shot at his competitor, saying that her campaign is solely for re-election while he runs on issues.  \u201cIt\u2019s really only been in the last few days that, all of a sudden, (Hochul) says that now she has a plan to fight crime,\u201d Zeldin said, according to WCBS. \u201cBut, then, she followed it up with trying to ridicule New Yorkers who want to lock up criminals, saying that it\u2019s a conspiracy, that it\u2019s data denying. And she\u2019s kept digging deeper and deeper a hole over the last couple of weeks.\"\u00a0 He encouraged young Republicans who might eye public office in the future to stay true to themselves.  \u201cIt\u2019s not by us making believe we\u2019re someone else or something else,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re going to win this race and make history, the reason why we\u2019re going to paint all of Suffolk County red in the House races, the reason why we\u2019re going to paint Suffolk County red in these state legislative races, the reason why we\u2019re going to make history is by all of you being true, all of us being true to exactly what got us involved in the first place.\" Zeldin said his ideas will ensure the state government rolls back pro-criminal laws, holds district attorneys responsible if they refuse to enforce the law, and back New Yorkers in law enforcement, he said. \u201c(New York City Mayor Eric Adams) says that he wants judges to have discretion. He\u2019s right. ... We need district attorneys doing their job, we don\u2019t have a recall in this state \u2014 but, what we do have, is the New York State Constitution says that a governor can remove a DA who refuses to enforce the law. I pledge that on the first day that I\u2019m in office, I\u2019m going to tell the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that he\u2019s being removed for his refusal to enforce the law.\u201d It\u2019s Election Day in America.

Check out these images showing a variety of election stickers around the country. Florida officials warned the US Justice Department that federal election monitors are not allowed inside polling places under state law, pushing back against federal plans for monitors in the state. In a letter to DOJ dated Monday, Florida state elections officials argued that federal officials are not included on the list of people allowed inside polling places, and even if they did qualify, it \u201cwould be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.\u201d The Justice Department announced plans to send elections monitors to 24 states, including three counties in Florida \u2013 Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. The practice of sending federal election monitors to local jurisdictions dates back decades. But the department did \u201cnot detail the need for federal monitors in these counties,\u201d Florida Department of State General Counsel Brad McVay wrote to DOJ in the letter. The Florida Department of State will send its own monitors to the three jurisdictions, according to the letter, to \u201censure that there is no interference with the voting process.\u201d Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for reelection, told reporters Tuesday morning that the request by DOJ to go inside polling places was a deviation from years past when the agency sent monitors to Florida. The DOJ under former President Donald Trump sent monitors to six Florida counties in 2020, but Byrd said they kept tabs from outside the polling location. \u201cThis is not to be confrontational in any way,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cThey sent a letter to the counties asking for permission to be in the polling places. We told them that under state law, that is not permitted, and we asked them to respect state law, and that they can go there and do their job, but they have to do that job outside of the polling place.\u201d Asked why the state didn\u2019t send a similar letter in 2020 when Trump\u2019s DOJ monitored six Florida counties, Byrd said there was no change in policy. The Justice Department told CNN it has received the letter but declined to comment. Read more here.  ##Voting## Former President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he voted for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, predicting a \"great night\" for Republicans.\u00a0 \"Yes, I did,\" Trump told reporters when asked if he cast a ballot for DeSantis outside a polling location in Palm Beach where he voted.\u00a0 \"I think we're going to have a very great night and it's exciting,\" he added.\u00a0 Trump cast his ballot shortly after 11:30 a.m. ET at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, just minutes away from his Mar-a-Lago estate where he plans to watch election returns this evening with dozens of aides, allies, and local Republicans. He arrived with former first lady Melania Trump and briefly took questions outside after voting indoors.\u00a0\u00a0 The former president's political future may largely depend on Tuesday's midterm outcomes, as he looks for his handpicked and endorsed candidates in key\u00a0federal and statewide races to prevail. Major losses for Trump-backed candidates could create obstacles for his 2024 presidential campaign, which Trump is eyeing to announce one week from today.\u00a0 At a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump\u00a0referred to the Florida governor\u00a0as \u201cRon DeSanctimonious.\u201d ##Voting## ##Governor## Attorney Lin Wood tells CNN he will appear before the special grand jury that is investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to\u00a0overturn the 2020 election\u00a0in Georgia as a material witness tomorrow morning.\u00a0 The Special Purpose Grand Jury that is being led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis returns tomorrow after taking a roughly one-month hiatus around the election. Wood, a staunch Trump supporter, is a veteran defense attorney who focused on civil litigation and has worked on high-profile cases in the Atlanta-area. He pushed a series of cases after the 2020 Presidential election that were rapidly dismissed by the courts, and described as disinformation by state election officials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigators are also interested in hearing from Wood about a meeting he held at his South Carolina home with other supporters of the former president working on election challenges after the 2020 election.\u00a0\u00a0 CNN has reached out to the Fulton County DA for comment. You might hear that word \u2014 \"wave\" \u2014 thrown around this week if Republicans take some power from Democrats on Election Day. They'll argue they have been given a mandate from American voters. Republicans could seriously underperform their potential, considering President Biden's approval rating and the historical precedent, and still pick up five seats and the House majority. Is that a wave? Power will have changed dramatically. But it feels closer to a course correction than a major change in government. Here's a\u00a0full list of House majority changessince the start of the modern party system just before the Civil War. Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics and the American Enterprise Institute\u00a0argued back in 2018, just before Democrats reclaimed the House from Republicans, that it's a wave election if there is \"a sharp, unusually large shift in the national balance of power, across multiple levels of government.\" You'd need GOP victories in multiple governor's races and a Senate majority to make the change in power be reflected across multiple levels of government.\u00a0 Trende added some statistical criteria to argue an election is a wave election if it is outside the shift in power during an election. It might be easier to put a round number as a baseline and argue a swing of 50 or more House seats is a wave. By the 50-seat rule, the 2010 midterm election was certainly a Tea Party wave with a change of 64 seats in the House. The 1994 Republican revolution was a wave when the GOP gained 54 seats.\u00a0 The 2006 midterm where Democrats gained the majority with a 32-seat gain would not be a wave, even though it made Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House and gave Democrats a Senate majority. Trende argued 2006 could be viewed as a wave in conjunction with 2008, when Democrats gained an additional 21 seats in the House. But the 2018 midterm, when there was a 42-seat change, would not have been a wave, even though it restored Pelosi as House speaker. In any event, with this year's election, Republicans seem poised to once again take back control of the House. ##Analysis## While the White House is bracing for possible Election Day loses, Vice President Kamala Harris woke up this morning in rainy Los Angeles after telling a groups of organizers Monday night that Democrats would \u201csee victory.\u201d\u00a0 Harris started Tuesday with her normal routine, a senior Harris adviser tells CNN, maintaining her daily morning workout and attending her normal meetings, which means receiving some form of the president\u2019s daily briefing while in Los Angeles. The vice president will receive regular updates on election news\u00a0throughout the day from a host of staff in California, the Executive Building in DC, while aides stay connected with officials at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other Democratic Party officials who track midterms results closely. Harris is scheduled to spend Election Day calling into radio stations for quick interviews meant to drive turnout at 11:00 a.m. ET and 4:30 p.m. ET while her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, joins NARAL Pro-Choice America for a virtual political event on reproductive rights. Aides are also actively discussing if and how Harris could make an in-person and public Election Day stop somewhere in L.A., but are cognizant of how the vice president\u2019s large footprint could impede ground organizers during crucial voting hours.\u00a0 The vice president and second gentleman voted by filling out mail-in-ballots, which Emhoff said he would drop off after a rally on Monday. In the evening, Harris will watch the returns come in, but her location to watch return remains in flux and aides would not disclose exactly what the options are. Voting rights advocates in key states said the first hours of voting in Tuesday\u2019s midterms appeared to be going smoothly with only isolated problems reported. \u201cWhat we are seeing are things that we usually see on Election Day,\u201d said Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause. \u201cSometimes voters are going in and one of the voting machines isn\u2019t working or lines are a little longer.\u201d The key battleground state of Pennsylvania is \u201cnot experiencing anything systemic,\u201d Khalif Ali, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, told reporters late Tuesday morning. He said there were a handful of calls about polls opening late in eastern parts of the state and some isolated incidents of electioneering occurring too close to polling places in Allegheny County. He said poll workers quickly addressed the problem by moving the people farther away. A key issue in Pennsylvania remains the thousands of mail-in ballots are risk of being rejected because of missing or incorrect dates on the return envelope.\u00a0Ali said he does not know how many ballots are affected statewide. In Florida, Common Cause\u2019s Amy Keith said more than 15,000 mail-in ballots had been flagged across the Sunshine State for signature problems or other issues as late last week. Under state law, voters have until 5 p.m. ET Thursday to fix problems with those ballots. But Keith encouraged voters to go online to track their ballots and quickly resolve any issues before potential disruptions from tropical storm Nicole, which is bearing down on the state. An election official in Philadelphia on Tuesday told CNN nearly 3,600 mail-in ballots risk being rejected because of incorrect information, missing dates or missing secrecy envelopes.  The increase of roughly 200 ballots was added over the weekend. Roughly 250 of the 3,600 mail-in ballots have been cured.\u00a0People who weren\u2019t able to cure their ballots at city hall can still vote provisionally today.\u00a0 On Saturday, election officials in Philadelphia said more than 3,400 mail-in ballots risked being rejected because of incorrect information, missing dates or missing secrecy envelopes. Philadelphia City Commissioners\u2019 Chairwoman Lisa Deeley released the affected voters\u2019 names and urged them to take immediate steps to get replacement ballots. The action by Deeley came after the state Supreme Court last week barred local election officials from counting ballots with missing or incorrect dates on the return envelope.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am extremely disappointed in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision with regard to undated and incorrectly dated ballots,\u201d Deeley said in a statement. \u201cHandwritten dates are not material and the lack of such a date should not be a reason to disenfranchise a voter.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Pennsylvania\u2019s requirement that voters sign and provide a handwritten date on their ballot return envelope has been the subject of litigation for months. And on Friday, several Pennsylvania groups, including the state branches of the NAACP and the League of Women Voters, filed a\u00a0lawsuit in federal court, challenging the state\u2019s plan to not count undated ballots. The lawsuit calls a missing or incorrect date \u201ca meaningless technicality\u201d and argues that throwing out a ballot on those grounds violates federal civil rights law. ##Voting## As voters head to the polls on Election Day, more than 45 million pre-election ballots have already been cast across the 47 states where figures were available, according to data from elections officials, Edison Research and Catalist. Pre-election voting has been ahead of the 2018 pace across the states where data is available for the last three cycles. However, it\u2019s still too early to know if overall turnout will reach 2018 levels, as voting patterns may have changed in the last few years.\u00a0 Texas still has the most pre-election votes, with more than 5.4 million ballots cast. Florida has had more than 4.9 million ballots cast, and California has more than 4.7 million. Georgia, with more than 2.5 million ballots cast, and North Carolina, with more than 2.1 million, are the only other states with more than 2 million ballots cast so far.\u00a0 The number of ballots cast will continue to increase as more mail is delivered, voters drop off their ballots and election officials update their tallies.\u00a0 Some voter data comes from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and is giving insights into who is voting before November. \u00a0##Voting## Lavonne Cobb voted today with her economic future in mind \u2013 and that\u2019s why she said she cast her ballot for Democratic candidates. \u201cSocial Security is a big issue when it comes to voting,\u201d said Cobb, 50, pausing to talk for a moment as she left the county civic center in Marietta, Georgia. \u201cI came out to make sure that I put in my vote so that my generation will have some type of security in the future.\u201d For all the millions of dollars in TV ads \u2013 about a quarter billion in the Senate race alone during Georgia\u2019s primary and general elections \u2013 Cobb expressed exhaustion and excitement at Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s entertaining,\u201d she said of the barrage of ads, \u201cbut I am so ready for it to be over.\u201d She supported Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, as she did two years ago. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t seemed to let me down,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cYou know when you go to a restaurant, you stick with what you know, then you don\u2019t have to worry about being disappointed? I stuck with what I know.\u201d\u00a0 ##Voting## Watch here:  \u00a0Some check-in machines at voting centers in Bell County, Texas, are not working due to synchronization issues tied to Sunday\u2019s time change, according to an official. \u201cSome of our check-in machines \u2026 did not automatically update to the time change and as a result, because of the security involved with these things, they were not allowed to come online because the computer detected there\u2019s a synchronization issue,\u201d Bell County Public Information Officer James Stafford told CNN Tuesday morning. \u201cOut of security, they were not allowed to come online, so we weren\u2019t able to check people in at those locations.\" Stafford stressed that the issue only affected check-in machines and not any voting tablets or voting tabulators, he said.\u00a0 Check-in machines at eight of the county\u2019s 42 voting centers were affected by this issue before polls opened, Stafford said. Two hours later, after polls opened, there are two voting centers still having this issue, he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Voters in Bell County may vote in any of the 42 voting centers in the county. People who came to locations affected by the check-in machine issues were told about alternate locations nearby, Stafford said.\u00a0\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report. ##Voting## US officials \u201ccontinue to see no specific or credible threat to disrupt election infrastructure\u201d as polls open across the country for the midterm elections, a senior US cybersecurity official told reporters Tuesday morning. Officials have not seen any significant hacking activity on Election Day that they can attribute to any given hacking group, an official from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters in a background briefing. Officials are expecting the possibility of low-level cyberattacks that may temporarily knock state and local websites offline, but nothing that will prevent voters from casting a ballot, the CISA official said.\u00a0 \u201cWe continue to remain in high confidence in the security or resilience of the elections,\u201d the official added.\u00a0 US Cyber Command, the Defense Department\u2019s hacking unit, and the National Security Agency are \u201csharing real-time\u201d intelligence with government agencies to help defend the midterm elections from foreign threats, the four-star general who heads both operations said in a statement Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cWe continue to refine what we learned from the 2018 and 2020 elections,\u201d Gen. Paul Nakasone said. \u201cWe generate insight to enable defense of the homeland, and ultimately impose costs by degrading and exposing foreign adversary capabilities and operations.\u201d Cyber Command has taken a much more active role in defending US elections from foreign interference since Russia\u2019s 2016 intervention. That included an operation during the 2018 midterm elections that temporarily blocked internet access for a notorious Russia troll farm.\u00a0 Nakasone reiterated what US intelligence officials have said for weeks: They are wary of foreign influence campaigns that continue after Election Day as the vote tallies come in.\u00a0 \u201cOur work does not end on Nov. 8,\u201d Nakasone said.\u00a0 Twelve states activated National Guard troops for local and state-level cyber election support, according to a Defense Department spokesperson.\u00a0\u00a0 Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina, New Mexico, West Virginia and Washington state activated National Guard troops for cyber election support. A total of 92 members were activated across the 12 states to assist, the spokesperson added.\u00a0 During election primaries in May and June, the National Guard provided cyber support to eight states, the spokesperson added. CNN's Barbara Starr and Ellie Kaufman contributed reporting to this post.  ##Voting## Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson cast his ballot with his wife, Jane, at a polling location in Oshkosh on Tuesday. Afterwards, he spoke to reporters, saying his message to every Republican voter is to \"get out and vote.\"  \u201cI just want to encourage every Republican to get out and vote. Assume this is a dead even race,\u201d he said. \u201cI'd like to win by a wide margin \u2014 not for partisan purposes, but literally, so we\u2019ll send a very strong signal to our Democrat colleagues that their policies aren't working.\u201d\u00a0 The Wisconsin Republican, who\u2019s been locked in a dead even race with Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, told reporters he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about his chances on election night. \u201cBut again, my message to Republican voters is assume this is a dead even race, get out and vote,\u201d he said. \u201cGet every one of your friends, family members that are going to vote for Republicans, get there get out to vote.\u201d Watch his comments in full: ##Senate## A federal judge barred poll workers at an election site in Beaumont, Texas, from engaging in certain conduct that Black voters said was intimidating.  US District Judge Michael J. Truncale, of the Eastern District of Texas, issued the temporary restraining order Monday in a case brought by Beaumont\u2019s chapter of the NAACP, which alleged that White poll workers spoke aggressively to Black voters, hovered too close behind Black voters while the voters operated voting machines, and declined to help Black voters cast their ballots. Truncale prohibited poll workers in Jefferson County from engaging in the specific behaviors outlined in the NAACP complaint. However, he rejected the NAACP\u2019s request that he remove the official who is presiding as the election judge at the voting site where the conduct allegedly occurred. The lawsuit put forward declarations from several poll workers, voters and a local pastor who had been at the election site, a community center where a vast majority of voters are Black. They said they witnessed White poll workers aggressively demand that Black voters loudly recite their addresses, even after those voters\u2019 identities had been confirmed, while making no such demands of White voters.\u00a0 They also alleged that the White poll watchers and workers were following Black voters to the voting machines and standing close enough behind the votes that they could watch them mark their ballots. Additionally they said that the White poll workers refused to help Black voters insert their ballots into a ballot scanning machine, while giving that assistance to White voters. \u201cI witnessed White poll watchers standing so close to voters at the polling booth that they could watch the voters marking their ballots,\u201d a poll worker said in a declaration. \u201cThe poll watcher was not even two feet away from the voter. This happened twice over the course of the afternoon. On each occasion, the voter was Black and appeared intimidated by the behavior of the poll watchers. I had to ask the poll watcher to step back and stop looking at the voter\u2019s ballot as it was being completed.\u201d Airon Reynolds, a pastor of a local church who is Black, attested that he had tried to talk the Mary Beth Bowling, the election judge, and county clerk Laurie Leister last week about the alleged behavior. He said Bowling refused his request that she change her behavior and that Leister would also not direct Bowling to stop the conduct. Attorneys for the county officials did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. ##Voting## Voters in Bensalem, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, told CNN what motivated them to get out and vote in today's midterm elections, including issues around the economy, crime and abortion. Rosanne and Jack Payson\u00a0have lived in the Philadelphia suburb for 45 years.  \"I don't like Donald Trump.\u00a0Voting for a Republican like\u00a0Mastriano means that we're\u00a0going to have more trouble,\" Jack Payson told CNN's Jason Carroll.  GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano is facing Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro in the governor's race.  Rosanne Payson said the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade is one of the issues that motivated her to vote.  \"The Roe issue\u00a0bothers me.\u00a0I think women should be able to\u00a0choose.\u00a0... It is not\u00a0simply that they don't want the\u00a0child and they want an abortion,\u00a0there's other issues involved,\" she said.  Pennsylvania voter Brittany Castor said she identifies as a Republican and has voted for candidates in both parties in her life, but the issue of a woman's right to choose \"absolutely\" drove her to the polls this year.   Joseph and Susan O'Rourke said that crime, the economy and the border are the key issues for them.  Joseph O'Rourke said that GOP Senate candidate Mehmet Oz has spoken well about those three issues. On the gubernatorial side, he said while \"I don't think we have a\u00a0good selection,\" he voted for Mastriano. \"If you listen to\u00a0Mastriano, he is all law\u00a0enforcement and everything, but\u00a0then Josh Shapiro was the\u00a0attorney general so, you know,\u00a0it's a difficult choice to make,\" he said.\u00a0 He added that, like other swing voters in Bucks County, he voted for former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and then voted for President Biden.  On swing voters in Pennsylvania, voter Jack Payson said,\u00a0\"I really think that it is\u00a0good that people are flexible, that they should take into\u00a0account all of the issues, that they should have the right to\u00a0change their mind.\"\u00a0 Voter William Castelberg Jr. said that crime and the economy brought him to the polls.  \"Crime is big, you know, it's\u00a0really big in the city of\u00a0Philadelphia.\u00a0I would hate to see it come to\u00a0the suburbs here in Bucks\u00a0County.\u00a0The second thing is inflation.\u00a0You know, there's so many people\u00a0that can't afford day to day,\u00a0it's sad,\" he told Carroll. \u00a0 Here are some demographics of the state:  ##Voting## Moving to the state of Georgia changed how former New York resident Andy Hill perceived the importance of his vote. \"I lived in New York\u00a0previously, and it never seemed\u00a0urgent to vote for my own rights in\u00a0New York.\u00a0But it seems urgent here,\" he told CNN, acknowledging the important of voting in the battleground state. Hill voted at an Atlanta polling station on Tuesday morning. As a seminary student, he said what drives him to vote is whether or not the government protects basic human rights.  \"I saw what the Supreme Court did\u00a0to women's right in the last\u00a0term, and it made me really\u00a0concerned as a gay man that they're not going to be standing\u00a0up for my rights in the next\u00a0term if that comes up for debate,\" he said. \"So I want to make sure the\u00a0people who are in the office both at the state level and federal\u00a0level have my rights in mind and\u00a0are interested in protecting my\u00a0rights.\" Watch here: During her first public campaign event on Election Day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul stumped with local leaders at an Upper East Side subway station in New York City, where she talked about one of the hottest-button issues: crime.  Hochul said crime \u2014 a major point in opponent Rep. Lee Zeldin\u2019s campaign \u2014 is ultimately not a campaign issue for her because she\u2019s been working on it during her tenure as governor already.\u00a0 \u201cThe difference is soundbites versus actually sound policy. It's real easy to get out there stand on a street corner and scream about crime, but when you oppose every single sensible gun safety piece of legislation that we have put forward here in the state, but also when you had a chance to stand up in Congress for the first meaningful gun safety legislation bipartisan \u2013 other Republicans voted for this \u2013 he could not even do that. He didn\u2019t bother to show up in Congress to vote to fund the police \u2013 so the record is clear,\u201d she said, according to CNN affiliate NY1. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it; he talks about it,\u201d Hochul added.  \u201cIf they are thinking Lee Zeldin is going to defend democracy when he had a chance to stand up and call out the insurrectionists, what did he do that day? He went and blamed the Democrats and voted against certifying Joe Biden as our president. That\u2019s how you subvert democracy. That\u2019s exhibit A of subverting democracy,\u201d Hochul said. Hochul also said she and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are \u201cpartners\u201d in fighting crime. \u201cThis is not an election issue for me. ... We said we're going to partner together, for the first time the governor of New York will actually be engaged in helping the mayor of the city. That relationship has only grown stronger; you can ask Mayor Adams himself,\u201d she said. \u00a0 Hochul appeared with Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Rep. Jerry Nadler, state Sen. Liz Krueger, Assembly member Rebecca Seawright and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine at the 86th Street station.  Asked if there is anything New Yorkers might not know about her, she said it might be \u201chow tough I am.\u201d \u201cI call myself a street fighter from Buffalo. I have had to come up through a lot of tough knocks, as a lot of women do. You have to break down a lot of barriers, but that makes you stronger, makes you tougher to be able to handle the challenges,\u201d Hochul said.  \u201cThere is nothing I can\u2019t handle\u201d she continued, adding the election has \u201celevated\u201d her strength and desire to serve New York.\u00a0 ##Governor## Philadelphia election officials voted Tuesday morning to reestablish a process that\u2019s intended to catch double votes \u2013 in a move that is likely to slow down reporting of election results from the largest city in this battleground state. The decision to reinstitute the often-tedious process, known as poll book reconciliation, could focus national attention on Philadelphia if the consequential US Senate race between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz is close.\u00a0 The process compares mail ballots with poll books from Election Day to ensure people have not voted twice. The 2-1 vote by the Philadelphia city commissioner early Tuesday follows a lawsuit from a Republican group that alleged Philadelphia was inviting double votes with a plan to scale back on poll book reconciliation. Although Judge Anne Marie B. Coyle ruled against the Republican organization, she also criticized the move by city election officials to change the poll book process as \u201cerroneous.\u201d A Philadelphia city election official told CNN that the elections board voted to reinstate the process Tuesday out of an abundance of caution in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The official said they had intended not to use the process because they had not encountered any double votes over the course of the last three elections, and they wanted the process to move along more quickly.\u00a0 Although they were not required to reinstate it because of the Republican lawsuit, the official said, but chose to do so to quell any questions that may arise after the fact. They did not want even the perception that they are doing anything wrong, the official said, but they questioned why Philadelphia was the only city to be sued by the Republican group. During Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Seth Bluestein, the sole Republican on the commission, said that when questions arise about delays in Philadelphia results, it\u2019s because \u201cRepublicans targeted Philadelphia \u2026 to force us to do a procedure no other county does.\u201d Bluestein and Lisa Deeley, the Democratic chair of the board, voted to reinstate the procedure. Democrat Omar Sabir voted against it. The action comes as Philadelphia and other jurisdictions in Pennsylvania grapple with another Election Day issue: The risk of thousands of mail-in ballots being rejected because of missing or incomplete handwritten dates on the return envelope. ##Voting## Voters in Mercer County, New Jersey, are having to vote manually Tuesday morning due to a problem with the voting machines.\u00a0The county is home to Princeton, Trenton, Ewing and Lawrence Township. \u201cNo one will be disenfranchised and we are working on fixing the issue at present.\u00a0It may delay results but we will make sure everyone votes,\u201d said Mercer County Clerk Paula Sollami Covello in an email to CNN.\u00a0 The results will likely be tallied later than usual, but Covello did not rule out the possibility that the ballots voted manually could still be tallied Tuesday night.\u00a0\u00a0 The county has Dominion, the machine maker, and other IT professionals coming to fix the problem. Poll workers are on hand to walk voters through the process.\u00a0 \u201cThere is an issue with our Dominion scanners not reading throughout the county. There is a slot on the top of the scanner and voters can vote \u2014 and are voting manually,\u201d Covello added. \u201cNo voter should walk away. They can vote manually.\u201d Voters can and should still go to their respective polling locations. Their\u00a0ballot will be inserted into the \"emergency slot\" in the machine, according to an alert posted by Princeton, a town in Mercer County. \u00a0 ##Voting## This is a round-up of images showing early scenes around the country on Election Day. Check out what it looks like as voters on the East Coast begin to cast their ballots: See more photos from today here. Democratic Senate candidate Tim Ryan arrived Tuesday morning at a polling location in Ohio to vote. He spoke to reporters about campaigning in his home state. \"When you\u00a0grow up here, it is always, you\u00a0know, it's home.\u00a0It's home.\u00a0And the best part of the\u00a0campaign really has been meeting\u00a0people who are just like us \u2014\u00a0Different town, names, you know,\u00a0different cities, different\u00a0jobs, but\u00a0the people are the people.\u00a0They're the same, they're gritty, Ohio\u00a0is just filled with gritty workers.\u00a0Good people.\u00a0You know, who just want a\u00a0government who works for them.\u00a0And it would be an honor to\u00a0serve them,\" he said. Watch: Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was seen arriving at a polling location in Braddock, Pennsylvania, to vote on Tuesday morning. Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz arrived in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to vote Tuesday morning. He is running against Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman. \"I'm very proud of how I've\u00a0run this campaign.\u00a0Pennsylvania is sending a very\u00a0clear message to Washington \u2014 we\u00a0want less radicalism, and more\u00a0balance.\u00a0So I encourage everyone to vote.\u00a0It is your duty,\" he told reporters Tuesday. Tuesday's midterm elections come at a time of economic vulnerability for the United States. Recession predictions have largely turned to \"when\" not \"if\" and inflation remains stubbornly elevated. Americans are feeling the pain of rising interest rates and are facing a winter filled with geopolitical tension. The results of Tuesday's election will determine the makeup of a Congressional body that holds the potential to enact policies that will fundamentally change the fiscal landscape. Here's a look at what policy issues investors will pay particular attention to as they digest election results. Tax cuts:\u00a0If Republicans do take control of Congress, it would be difficult to enact any major tax reductions without some backing from Democrats or President Biden, meaning there could be grandstanding without much action.\u00a0\nDebt limit:\u00a0The federal debt ceiling was last lifted in December 2021 and will likely be hit by the Treasury at some point next year. That means it will need to be raised again in order to ensure that America can borrow the money it needs to run its government and ensure the smooth operation of the market for US Treasuries, totaling roughly $24 trillion.\u00a0A fight seems to be brewing between Democrats and Republicans. If the government ends up divided and brinkmanship continues, there could be bad news for markets.\nSpending: Goldman Sachs economists also note that a Democratic victory could likely increase the federal fiscal response in the event of recession, while Republicans would be more likely to avoid costly relief packages.\u00a0\nSocial Security: Popular programs like Social Security and Medicare face solvency issues long-term and the topic has become a hot-button issue on both sides of the aisle. The topic is so closely watched that even debating changes could impact consumer confidence, say analysts.\u00a0\nThe Federal Reserve:\u00a0Lawmakers have been increasingly speaking out against the pace of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes meant to fight inflation. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, alongside Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, John Hickenlooper and others have called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to slow the pace of hikes. Now, Republicans are getting involved. Expect more scrutiny from both parties after the elections.\u00a0 President Biden enters Election Day bracing for losses, with his advisors privately acknowledging they don\u2019t see a viable path for Democrats to hold onto their House majority.\u00a0 But Biden and his senior team start the day with the view that the prospect of Democrats holding on to their Senate majority is real \u2013 even if it\u2019s one that may take days, or longer, to be fully realized.\u00a0 Biden is planning to remain behind closed doors throughout the day, but aides say he\u2019ll stick to his regular morning schedule that includes his daily workout, morning meetings with his senior team and his daily intelligence briefing.\u00a0 The White House political team will set up a short walk away from the West Wing in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where they will be in close contact with the Democratic Party committees running point on the midterm races, as well as monitoring the legal and security issues that may develop.\u00a0 Biden\u2019s predecessors often spent Election Day popping up in radio interviews designed to drive turnout in particular states or among specific critical demographic groups \u2013 something Biden is likely to do as well. In the evening, Biden is planning to watch the returns with his close advisors, according to an official. While the official didn\u2019t detail where Biden planned to be when the polls closed, in big moments over the course of Biden\u2019s first 21 months in office \u2013 like the late-night House passage of his $1 trillion infrastructure bill,\u00a0he\u2019s invited his closest advisors to the residence to watch the events play out.\u00a0 The most important thing to remember for Nov. 9, the day after Election Day,\u00a0is to be ready for the likelihood that the broad outcome \u2013 which party will control the House and\u00a0Senate \u2013 may not be known for days or weeks. CNN did not project that Joe Biden would win the 2020 presidential election until\u00a0four days after Election Day. It was not clear Democrats would control the Senate\u00a0until two months later, on Jan. 6, 2021, when Jon Ossoff was projected to win the second of two runoff elections in Georgia. There could be another \"red mirage\": Projecting results can take time, and\u00a0not because of any widespread fraud or conspiracy. Rather, it\u2019s partially because a large portion of US voters are again casting their votes early and by mail. While that\u2019s far fewer pre-election votes than two years ago and the counting of these votes should go quicker in most states than it did in 2020, that doesn\u2019t mean it will be instantaneous. Back in 2020, multiple states had large portions of the vote uncounted as of noon the day after Election Day. That delay in 2020 was partially due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it\u2019s also because some states just take longer. California conducts elections mostly by mail and routinely has more than 30% of its vote uncounted by the next day. If the race to control the House is close and certain California races are close, it\u2019s entirely possible those races will need to play out to determine control. Read more about what happens after Election Day here.  ##House## ##Senate## Overall, there are 309 women running for House, Senate or governor on midterm ballots across the country this year.\u00a0Here's how it breaks down:\u00a0 House: There are 263 women running as either a Democrat or Republican for the House \u2014 106 of them are incumbents, 45 are running in open seats and 112 are challenging incumbents.\u00a0\nSenate: There are 21 women running for a seat as either a Democrat or Republican. There are three Senate races where women are running against each other.\u00a0\nWomen are breaking records in this year's gubernatorial races: There are 25 women are running for governor. A win for a woman could be historic in some states like Arkansas, Georgia and Iowa, where a woman has never served as governor. Political parties have more power when they control the House or Senate by winning a majority of the seats in that chamber. The party in power controls committees that write legislation and decides which measures will get a vote on the floor.  In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, the party with 51 votes has the majority. The Democrats\u2019 majority in Congress is currently razor-thin: The Senate is a 50-50 split (with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote giving them the advantage) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s control of the House rests on a slim margin. In 2022, all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats are on the ballot.  Why are only a third of senators up for election? Senators serve six-year terms, and there are federal elections every two years. The seats are broken up into three classes, and about a third of the Senate is on the ballot every two years. The 2022 election features Class III senators. See the\u00a0race ratings\u00a0by Inside Elections. Why are all 435 House members up for election every two years? The House of Representatives is the piece of the federal government that is closest to the people. Putting House members up for election every two years allows voters more direct and immediate control of the direction of their government. Read up on other key terms to know for election night here.  Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman\u2019s campaign has gone to a federal court to try to have Pennsylvania voters\u2019\u00a0mail-in ballots counted\u00a0if they weren\u2019t signed with a valid date. A divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently\u00a0ordered counties to refrain from counting mailed ballots with missing or invalid dates on their outer envelopes. But Fetterman is hoping the federal court will supersede the state court\u2019s decision. The question of whether mailed ballots with incorrect or missing dates can be counted is one of the\u00a0hottest voting disputes in the pivotal state\u00a0leading up to Election Day. \u201cThe date on a mail ballot envelope thus has no bearing on a voter\u2019s qualifications and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote. This unnecessary impediment violates the Civil Rights Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution,\u201d attorneys for Fetterman and the Democrats wrote in their new lawsuit filed Monday in the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Republicans have advocated for strict rules\u00a0around mailed-in voting\u00a0that would force ballots with missing information to be rejected. Remember: Fetterman\u2019s race against Republican nominee Mehmet Oz is\u00a0one of the year\u2019s marquee Senate races. Republicans view holding on to the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey as key to their hopes of capturing the Senate majority, while Democrats see flipping seats in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, both states carried by now-President Joe Biden in 2020, as the best way to gird against losses elsewhere.  CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean contributed to this report. ##Senate## ##Voting## Are you having difficulty registering or voting, whether in person or by mail?

Here are four areas that are at stake this Tuesday for Biden and his administration: GOP investigations: Republicans on Capitol Hill have made abundantly clear\u00a0that if they take control of Congress,\u00a0Biden should brace for investigations targeting him, the White House and even members of the his family. GOP lawmakers\u00a0including Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan,\u00a0who are likely to chair the House Oversight and Judiciary committees respectively, are getting ready to probe a range of issues, from the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter; to what Republicans allege is political interference by the FBI and Justice Department; to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Agenda: If Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the era of big, progressive bills will likely end. Instead, Biden will be on the defense as Republicans work to undo much of what he accomplished in the first two years of his term. The GOP has already vowed to roll back elements of Biden\u2019s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, including its new, higher taxes on corporations. And they could work to roll back or challenge some of the president\u2019s climate initiatives that are included in the package. Biden\u2019s 2024 decision: As soon as the 2022 midterm election results are in, national attention will immediately turn to 2024 \u2013 including on the question of whether Biden will seek a second term. For weeks, the president and his advisers have maintained that his intention, for now, is to run again. They\u2019ve also said that no decision is final until the president has had ample opportunity to discuss his political future with his family. But Biden\u2019s 2024 decision won\u2019t just be a family affair \u2013 there will also be strong political dynamics at play. Staffing changes: Biden has seen remarkably little turnover in the first two years of his tenure among his Cabinet and senior team. His inner circle remains mostly intact. That includes chief of staff Ron Klain, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, deputy chiefs of staff Bruce Reed and Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, communications director Kate Bedingfield and top communications adviser Anita Dunn. Officials have said changes are possible both to the president\u2019s Cabinet and his senior White House staff later this year, though no moves are guaranteed. Should Biden announce his decision to run in 2024, several of the members of his core team are considered likely to shift over to the political operation. ##Analysis## The\u00a02022 midterms\u00a0have arrived and here are seven things to watch in Tuesday's midterm elections: Who will control the House: Of all the major storylines on Tuesday evening, this is one that few Democrats dispute: It is unlikely the party will control the legislative chamber come January. Given Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to take the majority, the odds of the GOP taking back the House are high. The party is on offense in House race across the country, but most notably in districts Biden won handily just two years ago, including once seemingly solid blue districts in\u00a0Rhode Island,\u00a0New York\u00a0and\u00a0Oregon. Who will control the Senate: If control of the House feels like more of an unavoidable loss for Democrats, control of the currently\u00a0evenly divided Senate offers a surprising bright spot\u00a0for the party \u2014 aided by voters harboring unfavorable feelings about Republican candidates while also disapproving of Biden's job performance. The most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are on the ballot are in\u00a0Nevada,\u00a0New Hampshire,\u00a0Arizona\u00a0and\u00a0Georgia, where polls show each of those races are tight. The party is on offense in\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0and\u00a0Wisconsin, two states Biden won just two years ago.  Election deniers in key swing states: Republicans who have parroted\u00a0former President\u00a0Donald Trump's lies about widespread voter fraud are seeking to take charge of some swing states' election machinery. The outcomes in those states could have dramatic consequences in 2024, with Trump on the\u00a0verge of another presidential bid\u00a0and candidates in crucial swing states seeking positions that they could attempt to use to undercut voters' will. Will Latino voters continue rightward shift: Republicans will watch whether they built on the gains that Trump made\u00a0among Latino voters\u00a0two years ago. Three House races in the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley in Texas will tell part of the story. Latino voters also make up crucial portions of the electorate in Arizona, Nevada and Miami-Dade County in Florida. The impact of presidential politics: \"If we lose the House and Senate, it's going to be a horrible two years,\" Biden said at a fundraiser on Friday. It's an argument former President Barack Obama, who stumped for candidates in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania over the last few weeks, made explicitly during his final rally in Philadelphia on Saturday. The wave-makers (or breakers): The shape of Congress over the next two years could become pretty apparent within the first few hours after the polls close on the East Coast -- even if a handful of big races are too close to call. For Democrats, defeat in even two out of three of the contests would portend a very, very bad night. The party, both nationally and in certain states, has increasingly invested its electoral fate on the notoriously fickle suburbs. If a Republican wave is coming, the first sighting of high tides will be up and down the Atlantic seaboard. The wait: As most Americans learned two years ago, Election Day can be a misnomer. Tuesday is when voting ends. But, in many states, it's also when counting begins. That means a lot of hotly contested races could take into the wee hours or even later this week to be decided. That's partially the nature of counting \u2014 and sometimes recounting \u2014 but it's also due to state laws that instruct poll workers how to do their jobs and, in some states, make them hold off on doing them until later in the day. ##House## ##Senate## In the contentious Georgia Senate race, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, the first Black senator from Georgia who, along with Jon Ossoff, delivered control of the chamber for Democrats in a pair of January 2021 runoff elections, is once again on the ballot. Now, though, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church is trying to win his first full term against Trump-backed football star Herschel Walker.\u00a0\u00a0 Walker\u2019s campaign has been dogged by scandals, including past allegations that he threatened women with violence, claims he has denied. The race was further rocked by a report in early October that Walker paid a woman to have an abortion in 2009. CNN hasn\u2019t confirmed that allegation and Walker has also repeatedly denied it. Walker also has a made a series of verbal stumbles on the campaign trail, like when he criticized efforts to reduce air pollution by saying China\u2019s \u201cbad air\u201d \u201cmoves over to our good air space.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Despite Walker\u2019s struggles, Georgia only recently shifted towards Democrats, so the race is expected to be close. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two will compete in a Dec. 6 runoff.\u00a0 There are also key House races happening in the state:  2nd Congressional District: Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop, who has served in Congress for 30 years, faces Republican Chris West for one of the only competitive House races in the state. Under the new map congressional map, Black voters will no longer represent the majority in two of the four previous Black-majority districts \u2014 one of those districts is the 2nd, represented currently by Bishop.\u00a0\n6th Congressional District: Republican Rich McCormick had support from others within the Republican Party during the primaries, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, as well as support from the PAC for the Club for Growth. This is his second bid for Congress and he ran as a MAGA-style conservative. The new district is heavily Republican, and McCormick is a clear favorite to win the seat over Democratic challenger Bob Christian.\u00a0\n10th Congressional District: In this heavily Republican district GOP nominee Mike Collins is expected to keep the seat in GOP hands in November. Collins ran as a \u201cconservative outsider\u201d and embraced a populist conservative agenda. He also falsely claimed that the 2020 election in Georgia was \u201cstolen\u201d by Joe Biden and the Democrats. He faces Democrat Tabitha Johnson-Green.\u00a0 Poll times: Polls close across the state at 7 p.m. ET.\u00a0 Political landscape: Atlanta and its inner suburbs are the most solidly Democratic regions of the state. The city\u2019s outer suburbs have historically supported Republicans, but many of these affluent areas have moved towards Democrats in recent years.\u00a0\u00a0 ##House## ##Senate## Americans head to the polls today for an election that has state and local officials across the country on edge as they brace for potential problems at the polls, contentious legal fights over ballots and\u00a0fighting disinformation\u00a0about the vote itself. The hyper-polarized political climate has seen the vote itself come under a sustained barrage of attacks and disinformation for the better part of two years amid repeated false claims from former President Donald Trump that the 2020 election was stolen. Early voting has provided a preview of the potential issues both big and small that could arise on Election Day, from armed ballot box watchers in Arizona accused of\u00a0conspiring to intimidate voters\u00a0to a\u00a0legal fight\u00a0over technical errors invalidating mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. Legal fights: In all, there have been\u00a0about 120 legal cases\u00a0surrounding voting filed as of November 3, compared to 68 before election day in 2020. More than half of the cases have sought to restrict access to the ballot, according to the Democracy Docket, a liberal-leaning voting rights and media platform that tracks election litigation. In Pennsylvania, some counties are urging voters\u00a0to correct absentee ballots\u00a0with missing or improper dates that the state Supreme Court\u00a0ordered to be set aside, while a federal legal challenge over is still looming. In Michigan, meanwhile, a judge rejected a lawsuit Monday from the GOP secretary of state candidate seeking to throw out absentee ballots in Democratic-heavy Detroit. Georgia\u2019s Cobb County on Monday\u00a0extended the deadline\u00a0for roughly 1,000 absentee ballots to be turned in until Nov. 14, after the ballots were not mailed out until just days before Election Day due to procedural errors in the election office. Possible conflict with election deniers: In Arizona, the secretary of state\u2019s office has sent 18 referrals to law enforcement related to drop-box intimidation, including a threatening message toward a government worker and several voters reporting being filmed at drop box locations in Maricopa County last week. A federal judge earlier this month\u00a0imposed new restrictions\u00a0against a right-wing group in the state following complaints about aggressive patrols of ballot boxes in the state, including blocking the members from openly carrying guns or wearing body armor. CNN\u2019s Jason Morris contributed to this report. Democrats are hoping to hold on to power, while Republicans yearn to gain control of both the House and the Senate. And while we all have guesses of what will happen, the truth is that we don\u2019t know what will play out.\u00a0 With that uncertainty in mind, here are three different scenarios that could be key to how the battle for control shakes out.\u00a0 Georgia runoff determines Senate\u00a0If you follow politics to any degree, you certainly have. Unlike other states with close Senate races, Georgia requires candidates to receive a majority of the vote to win on Election Day. If no candidate does, then a runoff between the top two candidates is held in December.\u00a0 The conditions are fairly ripe for such a scenario. Neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican Herschel Walker is at 50% in the Georgia Senate polls. Libertarian Chase Oliver is pulling in 3% to 4%.\u00a0 If every other race goes exactly as the polls predict, Democrats will have 49 seats, not including Georgia. Republicans will have 50 seats. This means that whichever side wins in Georgia would control the Senate.\u00a0 The Senate actually gets projected early\u00a0Then there\u2019s the other side of the spectrum. Most people are anticipating that we won\u2019t know who wins the Senate until days, if not weeks, after Election Day. That may be the case, but it\u2019s far from a certainty.\u00a0 There are a few ways we could conceivably get a fairly fast call. The easiest way for it to happen is if the Republicans win both Georgia (with a majority to avoid a runoff) and Pennsylvania. That way, we\u2019re probably not reliant on what could be longer counts in Arizona and Nevada.\u00a0 Another way this might happen is if there is a surprising result in the east. If Republicans have a very good night, they could win the New Hampshire Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is running for reelection against Republican Don Bolduc. If Democrats have a very good night, they could win the Ohio Senate race, an open seat where Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is facing off with Trump-endorsed J.D. Vance.\u00a0 An early call of the House\u00a0\u00a0Just weeks ago, the race for both the House and Senate looked close. While the Senate still does, it\u2019s easy to see how the House could turn into a relative blowout.\u00a0 If that happens, we won\u2019t have to wait for the West Coast. We won\u2019t have to wait for the results from ranked-choice voting races.\u00a0 Instead, we\u2019ll get a pretty good idea from even the earliest of poll closings. Consider a race like that for Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, a swing district centered in Virginia Beach. Rep. Elaine Luria would likely win if Democrats are to be competitive in the House. If she\u2019s defeated, Republicans are probably on their way to House control.\u00a0 If it\u2019s a big Republican night, we could also see Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan go down in Indiana. Indiana, unlike a lot of other states, requires voters to have an excuse to vote absentee.\u00a0 The bottom line is that if Republicans end up with close to 240 seats (as they did in 2010), then the race for House control won\u2019t be drawn out.\u00a0 Read more potential Election Day scenarios here.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Analysis## Democrats won the Senate after flipping Georgia last year and the state could be pivotal once again in the 2022 midterm elections. For the second time in less than two years,\u00a0the Peach State, which elected two Democratic senators in the last election cycle, is home to a contest that has gripped both national parties and potentially holds the key to the fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. This time around, though, at least one key characteristic of the race has been reversed: Democrat Raphael Warnock has gone from challenger to incumbent, trying to fend off Republican nominee Herschel Walker. The former football great, recruited and endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has run an uneven campaign and spent the past month beset by controversy, but is still running neck-and-neck with Warnock with early voting in high gear and Election Day nearing. A Warnock victory would likely foreclose Republicans\u2019 path to a majority in the Senate, which is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting a decisive vote. That reality, coupled with headwinds \u2013 in the form of economic angst and Biden\u2019s low approval ratings \u2013 familiar to Democrats across the country, has helped coalesce Republicans behind Walker. Underscoring his party\u2019s mix of ambivalence and political practicality, former Vice President Mike Pence, after not mentioning Walker during his remarks at a rally in Cumming, Georgia, on Tuesday for GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, told reporters he is \u201csupporting the whole (Republican) ticket here in Georgia.\u201d The most recent polling of the race, from the New York Times and Siena College, showed no clear leader, with 49% of likely voters supporting Warnock to the 46% backing Walker \u2013 a difference well within the survey\u2019s margin of error. Another poll, from Fox News at the end of October, also found a remarkably close contest, with Warnock at 44% and Walker at 43%. If neither candidate notches a majority of the vote, the race would be decided in a December 6 runoff.

These states all have multiple critical races that will determine control of the Senate, the House and state governments. What happens in these states will impact issues like abortion rights, economic policy, education and the climate crisis \u2014 not just within their borders, but across the country. Here\u2019s the \u201ctoo long; didn't read\u201d on what you need to know about the biggest states \u2014 and key races \u2014 ahead of the midterms. The first statewide polls will close tonight at 7 p.m. ET, and it could take some time until we learn results.  CNN political director David Chalian breaks down what to watch for as polls close: "

  "text": "Our live coverage of the 2022 midterms has moved. You can find the latest updates here. Americans are heading to the polls Tuesday in an election that has state and local officials across the country on edge, bracing for potential problems in voting stations, contentious legal battles over ballots and a\u00a0fight against disinformation\u00a0about the vote itself. More than\u00a041 million pre-election ballots\u00a0were cast in 47 states, and officials are expecting high turnout on Election Day, too, for the congressional, state and gubernatorial contests that will determine control of Congress and state legislative chambers. Most of the tens of millions who will cast ballots on Tuesday will do so without issue, in an election where early voting has been ahead of 2018 levels. At the same time, election officials are grappling with newfound pressures in the midst of a hyper-polarized political climate that\u2019s seen the vote itself come under a sustained barrage of attacks and disinformation for the better part of two years amid repeated false claims from former President Donald Trump that the 2020 election was stolen. State and local officials and voting rights advocates have raised the alarm that the political attacks have sparked an\u00a0exodus of local elections officials\u00a0in charge of the vote amid a marked rise in threats of violence against election workers. Early voting has provided a preview of the potential issues both big and small that could arise on Election Day, from armed ballot box watchers in Arizona accused of\u00a0conspiring to intimidate voters\u00a0to a\u00a0legal fight\u00a0over technical errors invalidating mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. In all, there have been\u00a0approximately 120 legal cases\u00a0surrounding voting filed as of November 3, compared to 68 before Election Day in 2020. More than half of the cases have sought to restrict access to the ballot, according to the Democracy Docket, a liberal-leaning voting rights and media platform that tracks election litigation.

The Nov. 8 midterm elections in the United States will be tremendously consequential \u2014 not just for the country itself, but also for the world.\u00a0\u00a0 For the country's both majority parties, it is about who controls Congress, the United States' legislative body. US President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic Party currently holds a very narrow majority over the Republicans in Congress, which gives them the ability to band together and pass more progressive legislations. \u00a0 However, there are many seats up for reelection in 2022 that could easily shift the balance of power. In turn, that could define the values of the nation on issues of global interest and importance, like climate, women\u2019s health care, education, immigration and gun violence, and how the country leads the global community on them.\u00a0\u00a0 The Senate, one of the legislative bodies of Congress, is a 50-50 split (with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote giving them the advantage) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s control of the House, the other legislative body, rests on a slim margin. In 2022, all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats are on the ballot. Additionally, 36 out of 50 states will elect governors.\u00a0 The Republican Party, also known as the GOP, has been known to downplay the climate crisis, reject gun control legislation, be more conservative on immigration and push for national abortion bans. For instance, former President Donald Trump of the Republican Party infamously withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017. There are GOP-led abortion ban bills across various states in the US. Republicans also collectively defend Americans\u2019 right to bear arms and Trump and other GOP leaders have rejected efforts to overhaul gun laws\u00a0after mass shootings have occurred in the country. \u00a0 The elections could determine if Democrats keep control of Congress, allowing them to put the wind in the sails for the Biden administration\u2019s agenda, including on international issues. If Republicans seize control of both or one of the chambers, the future of Biden's legislative agenda could be in jeopardy. \u00a0 The midterm election will also provide a look further into the future as it will be the first national election since\u00a0Biden\u00a0defeated\u00a0Trump in 2020. It will serve as a litmus test for Trump\u2019s stronghold and relevance in the country, and perhaps, the bellwether election for how the country could vote in the next presidential election.\u00a0It will also be the first major national election since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection happened at the US Capitol in Washington DC, which houses the US legislative chambers. \u00a0 The stakes of America\u2019s 2022 midterm elections are high, making it a cycle to watch.\u00a0\u00a0 Dive deeper: Read more about how the US compares to other countries on abortion rights and how US gun culture stacks up against the rest of the world.\u00a0 As polls close across the United States during the Nov. 8 midterm elections, CNN will begin to make projections on races.  Here's what you need to know about how it works:  What is a CNN \u201ckey race\u201d? Who decides that?\u00a0 \u201cKey race\u201d is a subjective term. Most politics watchers generally agree that only a subset of races is truly competitive in November, and these are generally considered the key races. Political parties spend more money on these races. Reporters spend more time covering them.\u00a0 Of the 35 Senate races on the ballot in 2022, the election forecasters at Inside Elections consider three to be true toss-ups and another four to tilt toward either Republicans or Democrats.\u00a0 Nineteen House races are true toss-ups, although many more could wind up being closely contested. Five governor races are toss-ups.\u00a0 See the Inside Elections ratings for\u00a0Senate,\u00a0House\u00a0and\u00a0governor.\u00a0 Key races can also be races that might be less competitive but have broader implications or feature especially notable candidates.\u00a0 How does CNN make projections?\u00a0 Using a mix of many factors, including current and previous election results, real-time exit polling, recent opinion polls, voter registration data and more, CNN\u2019s decision desk is frequently able to reliably project that a candidate has received enough support to win. It is a projection, however, and not the final word. State officials and courts have the official say.\u00a0 Can CNN project a race without any votes in?\u00a0 This is a task CNN takes very seriously. Based on previous election results, exit polling, recent opinion polls, early voter turnout and other factors, it is sometimes possible to see that one particular candidate will win a race. If there is any chance of an upset, CNN will refrain from projecting a race.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a quick lay of the land as you join us to follow the US midterm elections.\u00a0 When is Election Day?\u00a0 US elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November every other year. Election Day 2022 is on November 8.\u00a0 Who votes?\u00a0 American citizens over the age of 18 can vote. Some states make exceptions for people convicted of felony and some states require voters to register.\u00a0 Americans can also vote early \u2014 in person or by mail.\u00a0 Eight US states and the District of Columbia mail every voter a ballot. Some others allow early voting for everyone, and others require an excuse, although almost anyone can do some form of early voting (in person or by mail.)\u00a0 Who is being elected?\u00a0 The US Congress has two legislative bodies \u2014 the Senate and the House.\u00a0 Lawmakers elected to the Senate are called senators and they serve six-year terms. There are federal elections every two years. The seats are broken up into three classes, and about a third of the Senate is on the ballot every two years. The 2022 election features Class III senators. See the race ratings by Inside Elections.\u00a0 However, those elected to the House of Representatives are up for election every two years. Putting House members up for election every two years allows voters more direct and immediate control of the direction of their government since it\u2019s the piece of federal government closest to the people.\u00a0 Some state governors are also up for election in 2022. Each state treats its governors slightly differently. Forty-eight of the 50 US states elect governors to four-year terms. Two states, New Hampshire and Vermont, elect governors to two-year terms. Most states, 36 of them, hold their governor elections in midterm election years between presidential elections. Three states, Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana, elect governors in off-year elections the year before a presidential election. Two states, New Jersey and Virginia, elect governors in off-year elections the year after a presidential election.\u00a0 What is the balance of power?\u00a0 Political parties have more power when they control the House or Senate by winning a majority of the seats in that chamber. The party in power controls committees that write legislation and decides which measures will get a vote on the floor. In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, the party with 51 votes has the majority.\u00a0 Will we know who wins on Election Day?\u00a0 Don\u2019t count on final answers in every race on election night. With so many people voting early and by mail and so many close elections, there\u2019s a good chance that it will take days or weeks to figure out who won some races. The margins of power in both the House and Senate are close enough that it could take days to know who will have a majority of seats.\u00a0 Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and Senate nominee Blake Masters on Monday rallied supporters the night before Election Day, encouraging Arizonans to cast their ballot to enact an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in Arizona. Lake\u2019s voice wavered a bit as she appeared to grow emotional, saying \u201cThis is so beautiful \u2026 I just prayed to God before I walked out, I said give me the words I need.\u201d \u201cWe are so ready for a change, aren\u2019t we, in this country,\u201d Lake said. \u201cWe\u2019re so ready for fair elections, aren\u2019t we? And yet I know, like many of you, and especially me, I\u2019m worried about tomorrow.\u201d Lake -- who has repeatedly called\u00a0the 2020 election \u201cstolen\u201d-- again made a reference to \"stolen elections\" Monday night. \u201cThere\u2019s not a darn thing Katie Hobbs can screw up tomorrow to make our win any less significant because we\u2019re going to win tomorrow, we\u2019re going to vote tomorrow, and we are going to take Arizona back,\u201d she said to a cheering crowd. \u201cWe are America First and Arizona First and tomorrow we\u2019re going to vote to put Arizona first, right?\u201d Lake said. Lake is running against Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs, who currently serves as Arizona\u2019s secretary of state. Masters, an Arizona\u00a0Republican Senate nominee, called Tuesday election \u201ca save the country election.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the right Republicans elected into office tomorrow, man we\u2019re just one day away from losing our country. But I think we\u2019re one day away from winning this country back.\u201d Masters also expressed his support for Lake, saying she is \u201cgoing to give DeSantis a run for his money.\u201d The 2022 midterm elections will decide control of Congress, dozens of statewide positions and ballot measures on key issues in many states. This is a guide by poll-closing time for the notable races \u2013 both competitive and not \u2013 that are on the ballot.

anxieties votes Tuesday in an\u00a0election\u00a0that is more likely to cement its divides than promote unity. Elections are often cleansing moments setting the country on a fresh path powered by people freely choosing their leaders \u2013 and those leaders accepting the results. But the final hours of this midterm campaign laid bare the polarized electoral environment, the specter of political violence and the possibility of disputed races \u2013 all of which have raised the stakes of the first nationwide vote since\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0tried to overturn the 2020 election and have augured an acrimonious two years to come. Republicans predict they will win\u00a0the House of Representatives\u00a0on Tuesday \u2013 a victory that, if it materializes, would give them the power to throttle\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0domestic agenda and clamp an investigative vise on his White House. The Senate is, meanwhile,\u00a0on a knife edge\u00a0with a handful of races in states like Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania likely to decide who wins the majority. Above all, the midterm campaign turned on the cost of living crisis, with polls showing the economy by far the most important issue for voters, who are still waiting for the restoration of normality after a once-in-a-century pandemic Biden had promised in 2020. A gusher of news on job losses just before polls opened, including in the tech industry, worsened jitters about a slowdown that could destroy one of the bright spots of the Biden economy \u2013 historically low unemployment. Americans are already struggling with higher prices for food and gasoline and now must cope with the Federal Reserve hikes in interest rates that not only make credit card debt, buying a home and rent more expensive, but could tip the economy into a recession.

Mehmet Oz made his final pitch to voters at a rally the night before Election Day, saying, \"this is bigger than Pennsylvania.\" The hotly-contested Pennsylvania Senate race between Republican Oz and Democrat John Fetterman has had outsized importance in the fight for Senate control. In his final message before voters hit the polls Tuesday, Oz hit hard on a few major issues that have been consistent and effective throughout his campaign: The economy, crime, fentanyl overdoses and the border. And he once again asked his supporters to reach out to conservative Democrats and Independents to draw them in, telling the crowd in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to ask 10 people a simple question: \"Are they happy with the way the country is headed?\" And, if not, \"Tell them I am the candidate for change,\" Oz said. Former Governor of South Carolina and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, introduced Oz to the stage in Pennsburg Monday night. \"Dr. Oz knows what I know. When you're the child of immigrants, you know the sacrifice, you know the love of country, you know the fact that your parents raised you to give back because of how blessed you are,\" Haley said. \"He came from nothing, and he made himself something because only in American can that have happened.\" Oz closed with a message of \"bringing balance to Washington\" over extremism.\u00a0 \"I'm not a politician. You all know that. I'm a heart surgeon, and we tackle big problems, life-threatening problems like a broken heart. And we unite to do that. We don't divide,\" Oz said. \"Make sure we send the right person to Washington to represent your values and address the problems that are plaguing all of us here in Pennsylvania and the nation, because this is bigger than just Pennsylvania. It's in fact bigger than the country, in many ways,\" Oz added. Pat Harrigan, the US House candidate whose parents\u2019 home was fired at last month, stressed the need for Americans to come together on the eve of the 2022 midterms.\u00a0 \u201cI think we all have to step back, regardless of what political party we're in, and we have to say: \u2018Are we willing to sacrifice our values on the altar of scoring political points?\u2019 The answer must be no, regardless of what party we're from,\u201d Harrigan, a Republican, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cCNN Tonight.\u201d On October 18, it was discovered a gunshot had been fired into a Harrigan family home in Hickory, North Carolina, according to a Hickory police report. The shooting, which damaged a laundry room window, was reported to police the next morning, the report says. While Harrigan has cast the incident as \u201cpolitical violence,\u201d police have not mentioned a motive.\u00a0 Harrigan is the owner of a firearm manufacturing company running for North Carolina\u2019s newly drawn 14th District seat against state Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Democrat. Just a day before Election Day, more than 41 million people have already cast their ballots. And in several states \u2014 including two battleground states \u2014 more people have voted before Election Day than in 2018, according to data from election officials, Edison Research and Catalist.\u00a0 In Georgia and Wisconsin, more people voted before Election Day than they did four years ago. In the Peach State, where Democrats will try and hold onto a key Senate seat, more than 2.5 million people have already voted. In 2018, a total of more than 2.1 million Georgia voters cast their ballots before Election Day.\u00a0 It\u2019s a similar story in Wisconsin where Republicans will try to keep their Senate seat. More than 715,000 Wisconsinites already voted in the 2022 midterms, while less than 580,000 cast their ballots before Election Day in 2018.\u00a0 Pre-election voter totals aren\u2019t predictive of what total turnout will be in this election cycle \u2014and voting trends have changed since Covid-19 created new opportunities for many voters to vote before Election Day. Pre-election voting is still well behind 2020 levels, which isn\u2019t a surprise, given the larger voter turnout for presidential elections and the unusual pandemic circumstances.\u00a0 And Democrats are more likely to vote early \u2014 either by mail or early in-person \u2014 while Republicans are more likely to vote in person on Election Day.\u00a0 Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia have also already surpassed the total number of pre-election votes they recorded in 2018.  In most of these states, including Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, no-excuse early voting was not available to voters four years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 In the key states this election cycle where voters register by party, just one state \u2014 Arizona \u2014 has had a larger share of Democrats cast a ballot than at this point in the cycle in 2018.\u00a0 \u00a0Arizona Democrats make up 38% of those who have cast a ballot already, that\u2019s up from the 36% share they had in 2018, according to data from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and is giving insights into who is voting before November.\u00a0 The Republican share of pre-election turnout has dropped in the state with 37% of pre-election votes being cast by Republicans. In 2018, Arizona Republicans had cast 41% of pre-election votes at the same point in the cycle.\u00a0 Democrats in Ohio also have cast a larger share of pre-election votes than they did in 2018. Democrats made up a 32% share of the pre-election electorate in Ohio four years ago, and this time around they have made up 34%. Republican share dropped from 31% to 29%.\u00a0 Many Republican leaders, like former President Donald Trump, have questioned some pre-election voting methods like early voting, and have encouraged Republicans to vote on Election Day.\u00a0 In one potentially competitive state, Republicans make up a larger share of those who cast a pre-election ballot than Democrats.\u00a0 In Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and GOP Sen. Marco Rubio are both favored to win re-election, 43% of those who already cast a ballot are Republicans, while 36% are Democrats. At this point in 2018, when the state narrowly elected DeSantis and ousted a Democratic senator, 41% of those who cast ballots were Republicans and 40% were Democrats.\u00a0\u00a0 The pre-election electorate is also slightly younger in most key states than it was at this point in 2018.\u00a0 In Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, a larger share of voters under the age of 40 have already cast a ballot than they did at this point four years ago.\u00a0 In Arizona, more than 15% of those who have already voted are younger than 40. In 2018, that demographic made up 14% of the pre-election electorate.\u00a0 And in Georgia, a larger increase is seen. In 2018, more than 17% of those who had cast a ballot at this point were under the age of 40. That share is now more than 19% for this election.\u00a0\u00a0 In Wisconsin, voters under 40 make up 13.5% of those who have already voted, while four years ago that demographic was about 12% of the pre-election electorate.\u00a0 Most of these states saw the initial increase in younger voters casting ballots before Election Day between 2018 and 2020, when Covid-19 precautions expanded pre-election voting opportunities.\u00a0 \u00a0 ##Voting## Former President Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0said he will make \u201ca very big announcement\u201d on November\u00a015. \u201cI'm going to be making\u00a0a very big announcement\u00a0on\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0November\u00a015\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach Florida,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said, speaking at a rally in Ohio, before stressing the importance of voting in tomorrow\u2019s election. Top aides to Trump\u00a0have been eyeing the third week of\u00a0November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 presidential campaign, sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Trump\u00a0has been advised by several of his key lieutenants to announce his third presidential campaign from\u00a0one of the battleground states he narrowly lost to Joe Biden in 2020, according to a person\u00a0familiar with the conversations, though others have encouraged him to remain in Florida, where he remains deeply popular among the state's Republican voters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her husband is \u201cdoing OK\u201d but is in for a \u201clong haul\u201d recovery after he was attacked during a break-in at the couple\u2019s San Francisco home. \u201cHe knows he has to pace himself. He\u2019s such a gentleman that he\u2019s not complaining,\u201d Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in her first sit-down interview since the attack. Paul Pelosi\u00a0was attacked with a hammer\u00a0by a male assailant at the end of last month, authorities have said. The assailant was searching for the speaker of the House, according to court documents. Paul Pelosi suffered a blow to the head and had to undergo surgery. The speaker said the operation \u201cwas a success, but it\u2019s only one part of the recovery to a drastic head injury.\u201d \u201cIt takes time,\u201d she said, reflecting on the road ahead. Describing her husband\u2019s head injury, Pelosi said one piece of good news came when doctors \u201ctold us it had not pierced his brain, which can be deadly.\u201d Pelosi said her husband is worried about the emotional toll the attack could take. \u201cHe\u2019s so concerned about the traumatic effect on our children and our grandchildren, and we\u2019re concerned about the traumatic effect on him,\u201d she said. Asked if she has talked to her husband about what was going through his mind during the attack, Pelosi said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite had that conversation because any revisiting of it is really traumatizing.\u201d Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman closed out his campaign Monday night at a union headquarters in Pittsburgh, close to his home in Braddock, with a final appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not an accident that we stopped right here,\u201d Fetterman told the crowd.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s just one more thing left to do and that\u2019s to make sure you just vote tomorrow,\u201d he added. Fetterman hit familiar themes from the campaign trail: the importance of abortion rights, inflation, crime and raising the minimum wage.\u00a0He also used the moment to take one last swipe at his Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz.\u00a0 \u201cThis is an individual that has spent $27 million of his own money trying to buy this seat,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cPlease send me to Washington, D.C. Send him back to New Jersey,\u201d he added. ##Key Races## Wisconsin incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson offered a brief glimpse Friday of what the Senate will look like if Republicans win big in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, telling a group of supporters in his hometown of Oshkosh that he\u2019ll lead the charge in investigating political rivals. \u201cIf we do win, and if we get the majority, I would be chairman on the permanent subcommittee on investigations,\u201d he told the audience at his last stop before Election Day. \u201cAnd I do say, I would be like a mosquito in a nudist colony. It would be a target-rich environment.\u201d Johnson, who\u2019s crisscrossed Wisconsin in the final weeks of his campaign on a statewide bus tour, lamented the increasingly sharp rhetoric that\u2019s come to define the final days of the race. Johnson, who\u2019s running for his third term, is being challenged by Democratic Lieutenant Gov. Mandela Barnes Looking to tomorrow, Johnson pledged to \u201cdo everything I can to bring function back to Congress if I win,\u201d while urging supporters not to \u201ctake anything for granted,\u201d and \u201cto give them a really good shellacking.\u201d Listen to the CNN Political Briefing podcast for more analysis on the upcoming midterms. ##Key Races## President Joe Biden continued to project optimism for Democrats in tomorrow\u2019s midterm elections as he arrived back at the White House Monday night, but conceded that it will be \u201ctough\u201d for them to keep control of the House.\u00a0 \u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be tough. I think we can. I think we\u2019ll win the Senate and I think the House is tougher,\u201d Biden told reporters.\u00a0 Asked what awaits him if Republicans do take control of Congress, Biden said simply, \u201cmore difficult.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m feeling optimistic. But I\u2019m always optimistic,\u201d Biden said when asked how he was feeling about tomorrow.\u00a0 Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, making his closing arguments Monday night, said his Republican opponent Hershel Walker could not be trusted to tell the truth. Speaking at a rally in Columbus, Georgia, before a predominantly Black crowd in the parking lot of Abundant Life Church, Warnock said his contest against Walker was different from the other midterm matchups across the country Monday night.  \"If this were a race between a typical Democrat, whatever that is, and a typical Republican, this might be a hard question for the voters of Georgia to sort out but my race is not about a race between a Democrat and a Republican, the right and the left. When you look at the character flaws of the person that they put up, this is a difference between right and wrong. You cannot trust Herschel Walker to tell the truth about the basic facts of his life,\" said Warnock, before going on to sound the alarm about what he described as Walker's \"pattern of violence.\"\u00a0 The former football great, recruited and endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has run an uneven campaign and spent the past month beset by controversy, but is still running neck-and-neck with Warnock with early voting in high gear and Election Day nearing. While Warnock has voiced confidence going into Election Day, he's simultaneously raised concerns about the potential of a runoff with Walker. If neither candidate gets above 50%, it will trigger a runoff on Dec. 6. In several ads, Warnock has warned about a runoff next month. \"I think that there is bipartisan agreement that we rather not have politics and Thanksgiving mixed together,\" Warnock told CNN after the rally, before\u00a0reiterating that he's fully prepared to do whatever is needed to win. Listen to the CNN Political Briefing podcast for more analysis on the upcoming midterms. ##Key Races## On the eve of a critical Senate election in Georgia, Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker cast himself once again as a \u201cwarrior for God\u201d and boldly predicted he would win a majority on Election Day and defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock without a runoff.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re talking about a runoff. I\u2019m like runoff? Runoff? \u2026. We\u2019re winning this,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about no runoff. We\u2019re winning this. When we leave tomorrow night, we\u2019re leaving as winners.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0To avoid a December runoff, under Georgia\u2019s election rules, either Walker or Warnock must win more than 50% of the vote on Tuesday. With a third-party candidate in the race, it remains unknown whether that is possible. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a warrior for God,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHe\u2019s prepared me for a moment like this.\u201d Without directly mentioning allegations against him that he paid for abortions for former girlfriends, Walker said he had been unfairly vilified during the race. \u00a0As he has throughout his campaign, Walker wove an evangelical message throughout his remarks, saying if he is elected to Washington, \u201cJesus Christ is coming with me.\u201d \u00a0He delivered a blistering critique of Warnock, seeking to link him with President Joe Biden and the policies of the Democratic administration. He also invoked cultural wars and the use of pronouns, saying of his rival: \u201cSenator Warnock\u2019s pronouns are going to be former Senator.\u201d Walker spoke for about 15 minutes as a few hundred people gathered in the parking lot of a gun range in Kennesaw, located in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs of Cobb County. \u00a0A string of Republican officials warmed up the crowd for Walker. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired of having my vote canceled out,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told the crowd. \u201cI\u2019ll be the Budget Chairman, not Bernie Sanders. You don\u2019t even have to like me. That\u2019s a good deal for you.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe pathway to a Republican majority,\u201d Graham said, \u201cruns right through Georgia.\u201d Listen to the CNN Political Briefing podcast for more analysis on the upcoming midterms. ##Key Races## A parade-goer was arrested after hurling a beer can at Texas Senator Ted Cruz during the Astros World Series victory parade in downtown Houston on Monday. Cruz was on a float heading down Smith Street when a 33-year-old man threw a beer can that hit the Republican senator, according to Houston police. \u201cA male, 33, threw a beer can at U.S. Senator Ted Cruz as the Senator was on a float in the 2400 block of Smith St. The beer can struck the Senator in the chest/neck area,\u201d police said in a tweet. The senator did not require medical attention, police added. In one video, Cruz and another man on the float vehicle can be seen trying to deflect the projectile. \"As always I'm thankful for the Houston Police and Capitol Police for their quick action. I'm also thankful that the clown who threw his White Claw had a noodle for an arm,\u201d the senator said of the incident. In another video shot from a different angle by Alyssa Reans, parade-goers can be heard booing the senator and giving him the middle finger. Reans told CNN she shot the video on Monday about 20 minutes after the Houston Astros\u2019 victory parade started on Monday. \u201cEverybody was booing really loud, that\u2019s what caught my attention in the first place,\u201d she told CNN over Twitter. Police have not released the name of the man arrested since charges against him are pending. He faces assault charges, police tweeted. President Joe Biden sought to fire up Democrats on the eve of what he called \u201cone of the most important elections\u201d of people\u2019s lifetimes, urging Democrats to the polls as he reminded them of the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s elections. \u201cOur lifetimes are gonna be shaped by what happens in the next year to three years,\u201d Biden said Monday night. \u00a0Speaking at Bowie State University in Maryland, Biden reprised many of his recent attacks against \u201cMAGA Republican proposals,\u201d \u201ctrickle-down economics,\u201d and election deniers, warning voters in Maryland that the Republican gubernatorial nominee is among the latter group. \u00a0He praised Democratic Maryland gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore as \u201cthe real deal.\u201d \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s a combat veteran. Rhodes scholar. I\u2019ve always worried about Rhodes scholars, they\u2019re so damn smart,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe will be a great and historic governor of Maryland.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Biden also urged Maryland voters to reelect their congressional delegation, saying: \u201cHere in Maryland, you\u2019ve got some great people to vote for. Keep them. You need them. I need them.\u201d Biden talked about his own \u201chistoric commitment\u201d to Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Bowie State and said that while HBCUs didn\u2019t have the same endowments as many other universities, \u201cyou\u2019re just as smart, you\u2019re just as bright, you\u2019re just as good as any other college in America.\u201d \u00a0One of the best ways to honor HBCUs \u201cis to vote,\u201d he said. \u00a0While most of the crowd enthusiastically supported the president, he was interrupted at least four times during his remarks. At first, Biden told the crowd to \u201clet him sing\u201d when he was briefly interrupted by a protester. At another point, a man in a hat yelled something from the upper level of the gym about Hunter Biden and caused a larger distraction. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t jump, you look crazy enough to jump,\u201d Biden told the man, who kept yelling indistinctly. Another man wearing a similar hat also tried yelling over Biden, followed by another protester. The President continued with his speech and just talk over the interruptions, but the crowd tried to drown out the protestors by chanting \u201cwe love Joe\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s go Joe.\u201d More than 41 million pre-election ballots have been cast across 47 states, according to data from elections officials, Edison Research and Catalist. Pre-election voting has been ahead of the 2018 pace across the states where data is available from\u00a0for the last three cycles. However, it\u2019s still too early to know if overall turnout will reach 2018 levels, as voting patterns may have changed in the last few years.\u00a0 Here are photos of voting across the country. ##Voting## A judge in Arizona on Monday blocked a planned hand count of general election ballots in a Republican-controlled county,\u00a0pushing back on local officials who have expressed distrust of electronic vote-tallying machines. Superior Court Judge Casey McGinley said the plan by Cochise County to undertake a broad hand count as a way to check the accuracy of those machines violates state law \u2013 which he said permits election officials to audit only a small percentage of ballots by hand. The proponents of the hand count argued that it \u201cwould help ameliorate fears that the electronic count was incorrect,\u201d McGinley wrote in his 12-page opinion. \u201cHowever, there is no evidence before this Court that electronic tabulation is inaccurate in the first instance, or more importantly, that the audit system established by law is insufficient to detect any inaccuracy it may possess.\u201d The ruling \u2014 on the eve of the final day of voting in this year\u2019s consequential midterm elections \u2014 is the latest setback for conservative activists who have targeted voting machines in the wake of former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 loss. Late last month,\u00a0the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s office ordered the planned\u00a0hand counting of mail-in ballots\u00a0in Nye County, Nevada, to stop, after the state Supreme Court said the method planned by local officials violated state law. CNN has reached out to Cochise County officials for their reaction to the ruling. \u201cThis is a win for democracy and most of all, for the voters of Arizona,\u201d Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of All Voting is Local, said in a statement. \u201cFollowing best practices only reinforces trust in our election process and reassures voters that their votes will be counted and their voices will be heard.\"\u00a0 The Arizona Alliance of Retired Americans, Inc. and a Democratic voter brought the legal challenge. A brief filed on behalf of Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat running for governor, argued that allowing hand-counting in Cochise to proceed could have delayed the certification of election results in that county with a potential spillover effect statewide. ##Voting## Senate candidate John Fetterman's campaign has gone to a federal court to try to have Pennsylvania voters' mail-in ballots counted if they weren't signed with a valid date.\u00a0 The question of whether mailed ballots with incorrect or missing dates can be counted is one of the hottest voting disputes in the pivotal state leading up to Election Day, and a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently ordered counties to refrain from counting mailed ballots with missing or invalid dates on their outer envelopes. But Fetterman, a Democrat, and voters his campaign has aligned with are hoping the federal court will supersede the state court's decision. \"The Date Instruction imposes unnecessary hurdles that eligible Pennsylvanians must clear to exercise their most fundamental right, resulting in otherwise valid votes being arbitrarily rejected without any reciprocal benefit to the Commonwealth,\"\u00a0attorneys for Fetterman and the Democrats wrote in their new lawsuit filed Monday in the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\u00a0 \"The date on a mail ballot envelope thus has no bearing on a voter\u2019s qualifications and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote. This unnecessary impediment violates the Civil Rights Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution,\" they wrote.\u00a0 Republicans have advocated for strict rules around mailed-in voting that would force ballots with missing information to be rejected. The Fetterman campaign is joined in its lawsuit by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\u00a0 \"As we fight this latest Republican attack on Americans' democratic rights, Pennsylvanians should check their ballot status to ensure their vote is counted. We are committed to using every tool at our disposal to protect Pennsylvanians' constitutional right to participate in this election, including defeating the GOP in court,\" the groups said in a joint statement.\u00a0 ##Voting## Vice President Kamala Harris rallied California Democrats to elect mayoral candidate Karen Bass during a last-minute midterm event at the University of California Los Angeles. \"We\u2019re here to work. We have a day and half to see this through, get this done and elect the next mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass,\" she said to the crowd at UCLA. \u201cWe got a day and a half to get things done and we\u2019re not going to get distracted from the job in front of us.\" The vice president was interrupted by hecklers multiple times. The crowd tried to shout \u201cKamala,\u201d over them repeatedly.\u00a0 \u201cI love our democracy,\u201d she responded until Harris stopped and suggested the crowd chant Karen Bass\u2019 name since she is the candidate. Harris has spent the last week\u00a0boosting almost all female candidates ahead of the midterm elections.\u00a0 The vice president launched into her now-typical stump speech, reciting lines that voters put in their order to the administration and have received what they asked for.\u00a0 On the issues: \u201cBecause you voted and said, \u2018Hey! Nobody should have to go to jail for smoking weed,\u2019 we\u2019re now dealing with that because you voted,\u201d she said to the California crowd. On abortion, the vice president again slammed the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v Wade and Republicans who have already or want to pass strict abortion laws. \u201cWhen we are looking at a situation where there's a full-on unapologetic attack on individual rights we all have something to miss and lose,\u201d Harris said, calling more draconian abortion laws \u201cimmoral.\u201d \u201cThis is literally what we're up against, elections matter. Elections matter,\u201d she added. And again, the vice president spoke of the global implication for citizens around the globe should America adopt laws that restrict rights.\u00a0 \u201cSo my greatest fear right now includes that there are dictators and autocrats around the world, who are looking at their people who are fighting for their rights. And saying to them, \u2018Well, you want to hold out America. Look what's happening in that country,\u201d Harris said. Listen to the CNN Political Briefing podcast for more analysis on the upcoming midterms. President Joe Biden struck an optimistic tone while speaking at a virtual reception for the Democratic National Committee Monday, telling the DNC, Democrats will be in \u201cincredible shape\u201d if they\u2019re able to hold on to their majority in Congress, despite the GOP\u2019s considerable momentum in its bid to win back the House of Representatives while the destiny of the Democratic-run Senate will come down to a handful of knife-edge races.\u00a0\u00a0 \"You know, one more night, probably another 30 hours nationwide between now and where we are till the last vote is cast. One more night to do everything we can to win it and to keep it going. Look, if we're able to hold on, we're going to be in incredible shape. Imagine what we can do in a second term. If we maintain control. I know that sounds like a very high expectation, but I think - anyway, I'm optimistic,\u201d Biden said during a virtual reception that was attended by a small group of reporters.\u00a0 \"I want to remind you to remind your teams, with so much at stake for our nation, don't leave a thing \u2014 put it all out there. Go full bore till the last poll closes. Make that extra call \u2014 not a joke. Knock on that extra door. Most of all, keep the faith. Remind the folks that the power is in their hands,\" Biden said. Biden said that Democrats \"have a shot at keeping the Senate, increase in it.\" He added that he is optimistic about the House as well. The President said that Democrats are \"going up against some of the darkest forces we\u2019ve ever seen in our history\" in the Republican party.  \"These MAGA Republicans are a different breed \u2026 this is not your father\u2019s Republican Party. It\u2019s a different deal.\u201d US stocks popped on Monday, one day before the midterm elections.\u00a0\u00a0 Investors are betting Republicans will gain control of at least one, if not both, of the chambers of Congress. Wall Street typically favors divided government. The hope is that will lead to gridlock in Washington, DC, which means Congress can't\u00a0enact any new laws that may hurt corporate profits. The Dow gained nearly 425 points, or 1.3%. The S&P 500 rose 1%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. It was also the second straight day of solid gains, following Friday's big rally after a mostly solid jobs report. In corporate news, Facebook owner Meta Platforms surged 6.5% following reports that the company is about to announce a major round of job cuts. Dow component Walgreens rallied 4.1% after an affiliate of the drugstore chain disclosed plans to buy urgent care provider Summit Health for nearly $9 billion.  Ryan Anderson, 20, is a freshman at a local Christian College and works two full-time jobs. He's a Republican supporting Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano.  Anderson spoke to CNN at a Mastriano \"Restore Freedom Tour\" stop in Newton.  When choosing a candidate to vote for, Anderson said he wants someone who is \"for the people.\"\u00a0 \"I want them to actually work for us, try to help us, you know, get through everything we're going through currently, try to protect our rights, make sure the elections are fair,\" he said.  Adding, \"I'm a Republican because I believe in our core values that we have: Trying to help our country and trying to help other people.\" Anderson, who wore a \"Make America Born Again\" hat, isn't sure if he would support Donald Trump if he ran for the 2024 presidential election. \"I don't know. I would have to see what his policies are going to be. I supported him mainly because of Mike Pence. So, I don't know if I would support him again with everything that happened with Jan. 6,\" Anderson said.  After the insurrection on January 6, 2021, Anderson said he was worried. \"I believe things happened on that day that shouldn't have happened, and [Trump] should have condemned a little bit more than he did.\" Anderson explained, \"I just feel like it was a dark day in our country. I personally don't believe that the election may have been stolen on a wide scale like it was portrayed. So, I believe that he should have probably come out and condemned what happened, so nothing worse could have happened.\" Anderson said he likes Pence, because he believes the former vice president is \"a good Christian and he has good Christian values.\"  \"If Mike Pence decided to run, I'd have to really consider it, because I like his Christian values, and that's the main reason I supported Donald Trump in 2016 was because of Mike Pence,\" Anderson said.  ##Voter Voices##  Cobb County Elections has extended the deadline for 1,036 absentee ballots to be received through Nov. 14, after an agreement to extend the return deadline was reached during an emergency court hearing Monday.\u00a0 Cobb Election officials failed to send out 1,036 ballots after they say procedural errors were made on at least two days in October, when absentee ballots were requested but not created and mailed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Nov. 14 deadline for this batch of over 1,000 ballots is the same day that Georgia\u2019s military and overseas ballots are due, but absentee ballots still need to be cast and postmarked by Election Day.\u00a0Any voters who still haven\u2019t received their absentee ballots have the option to print out the federal write in absentee ballot used for overseas voters, according to Cobb County Election Attorney Daniel White.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe ballots appeared to be issued because they were marked in the system as issued, but the final step of actually running it through the machine did not,\u201d Janine Eveler, Cobb County Elections Director, said during a press conference Monday describing how the clerical mistake happened.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo the ballots were never packed up and sent. So it was completely human error,\u201d Eveler said, adding that the election worker responsible is \u201csick about it.\u201d\u00a0 Cobb County Election officials say that they determined that of the 1,036 absentee ballot snafus, there are currently 276 voters who may have been affected who have not already been sent an overnight return envelope with their absentee ballot or have not already cast their ballot during the early voting period. CNN has previously reported that over 2.5 million ballots have been cast in Georgia during early voting. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia\u00a0and its national office\u00a0and the Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0announced Sunday that they had filed a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0to give Cobb County absentee voters more time to receive and send back the mistake was discovered by Cobb election officials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office says that they plan to open an investigation into this Cobb County absentee ballot incident with the State Election Board.\u00a0 Former President Barack Obama has put out a robocall in support of Democratic Sen. Patty Murray in the closer-than-expected race for Senate in Washington state. In the call, Obama\u00a0endorses\u00a0his \u201cgood friend\u201d Murray in her race against Republican Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley.\u00a0 \u201cWhen I was President, I turned to Patty again and again to help pull us out of the Great Recession, pass the Affordable Care Act, protect Social Security and Medicare, and fight for women's reproductive rights and LGBTQ rights,\u201d Obama says in the call. Amir Avin, Murray\u2019s spokesperson, told CNN the senator is excited to have Obama's support. A spokesperson for Smiley did not comment. Inside Elections rates the race as \u201clikely Democrat.\u201d Both campaigns in the tight race for New York's 17th\u00a0congressional district are condemning a last-minute robocall allegedly representing \"grand rabbis\" in a message that appears to be aimed at exploiting tensions between Orthodox Jewish residents and non-Jewish residents of the district.\u00a0 The last-minute call claims: \"In the name of our grand rabbis we urge you to vote for Sean Maloney for Congress. Sean has a proven record of standing up for our community in Kiryas Joel. He fought the surrounding towns and villages that were trying to block the expansion of multifamily housing in our community. He secured tens of millions of dollars to build low-income housing in our community. He promised our leaders that if elected, he will do the same for communities in Rockland County, please show your support and vote for Sean Maloney for Congress.\" Maloney is currently the congressman for New York\u2019s 18th\u00a0congressional district, which includes Kiryas Joel,\u00a0a largely ultra-Orthodox Jewish community,\u00a0but\u00a0the New York congressional map was redrawn for the 2022 election. Maloney is running to represent the newly-drawn\u00a017th congressional district\u00a0which includes Rockland County, another county that has a large Jewish community.\u00a0 In\u00a0Orange\u00a0County, where Kiryas Joel is located,\u00a0tensions exist\u00a0between the Orthodox Jewish community, one of the poorest communities on paper in the US, and surrounding neighborhoods. In 2018, the community\u00a0separated\u00a0from the town of Monroe after years of lawsuits and conflicts over zoning.\u00a0While Maloney\u00a0has\u00a0helped bring\u00a0the Kiryas Joel community money for local infrastructure projects, there is no evidence he supported the community in zoning fights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A copy of the robocall was\u00a0obtained by CNN.\u00a0The call was first reported on Sunday by The Forward, a Jewish publication.\u00a0According to the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, the number associated with the calls made an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 calls on Sunday night to phones with 845 area codes \u2014 which is an area code for parts of the\u00a0district Maloney is running to represent\u00a0including Rockland County.\u00a0 The message reviewed by CNN failed\u00a0to identify who paid for the call in the introduction and give a callback number,\u00a0which violates rules from the Federal Communications Commission for auto-dialed or prerecorded voice political campaign calls. The number from which the calls were received is no longer a working number.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Maloney called the call an \"anti-Semitic smear.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"This robocall was not connected to or authorized by our campaign in any way,\" Mia Ehrenberg, Maloney's spokesperson told CNN.\u00a0 Maloney\u2019s opponent, Republican Assemblyman Mike Lawler\u00a0told The Forward\u00a0the call was \"total nonsense,\" adding\u00a0\u201cI don't condone it,\" and his spokesperson Bill O\u2019Reilly told CNN, \u201cThese are not from us.\u201d \u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated that the violent attack on her husband will factor into her decision about her own political future after the midterm elections. Pelosi, one of the most powerful figures in national Democratic politics, has earned a reputation as a\u00a0formidable leader to House Democrats who exerts significant influence on her caucus.  But\u00a0speculation is intensifying in Washington over what Pelosi\u2019s next move will be, and whether she would decide to retire if Republicans win back the majority.\u00a0\u00a0 During an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Pelosi was asked if she would confirm that she has made a decision \u2014 one way or another \u2014 about what she would do after the midterms. The Speaker said the \u201cdecision will be affected about what happened the last week or two,\u201d prompting Cooper to ask, \u201cWill your decision be impacted by the attack in any way?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt will?,\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cMhm, Yes,\u201d Pelosi said again.\u00a0 The violent attack on Paul Pelosi in their San Francisco home raised fresh concerns over threats of political violence driven by partisan animosity and increasingly hostile political rhetoric \u2014 and highlighted the potential vulnerability of lawmakers and their families in the current political climate.\u00a0\u00a0 A judge in Monroe County in Northeast Pennsylvania has decided that election officials can notify voters whose mail-in ballots were submitted with errors to give them a chance to correct them.\u00a0 The area's Republican Party had sued to prevent the outreach. The case is the latest local standoff in Pennsylvania over how to handle defective mailed-in ballots. \"To interfere ... at the 11th\u00a0hour would create additional uncertainty about the affected voters' right or ability to vote,\" the judge, Arthur Zulick, wrote in a decision on Monday. \"It has always been the policy of the Monroe County Election Board to allow a voter to come into the office to correct a defective absentee or mail-in ballot.\" Voters who sent in ballots without secrecy envelopes, external signatures or dates will still be able to vote. Once they are notified their vote may be canceled, they will be given the chance to correct their ballots by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\u00a0 Zulick noted that the Republicans who brought the case said at a hearing they had no issue with voters correcting defective ballots if they were handing a ballot over in person, \"across the counter.\"\u00a0 \"The only difference here is that the [Monroe County elections office] emailed or called the voters to advise them of the defect in their ballots,\u201d the judge wrote. \"I do not find that there was fraud involved or that there was political partisanship undertaken by [Monroe County elections] staff or the Board.\" As of Nov. 4, the lawsuit affected fewer than 200 votes, according to the judge's decision. The county had received about 15,000 absentee and mailed ballots as of late morning Nov. 4, the filing said. \u00a0##Voting## The most important thing to remember about the day after Election Day\u00a0is to be ready for the likelihood that the broad outcome \u2013 which party will control the House and\u00a0Senate \u2013 may not be known for days or weeks. CNN did not project that Joe Biden would win the 2020 presidential election until\u00a0four days after Election Day. It was not clear Democrats would control the Senate\u00a0until two months later, on Jan. 6, 2021, when Jon Ossoff was projected to win the second of two runoff elections in Georgia. There could be another \"red mirage\": Projecting results can take time, and\u00a0not because of any widespread fraud or conspiracy. Rather, it\u2019s partially because a large portion of US voters again are casting their votes early and by mail. While that\u2019s far fewer pre-election votes than two years ago and the counting of these votes should go quicker in most states than it did in 2020, that doesn\u2019t mean it will be instantaneous. Back in 2020, multiple states had large portions of the vote uncounted as of noon the day after Election Day. That delay in 2020 was partially due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it\u2019s also because some states just take longer. California conducts elections mostly by mail and routinely has more than 30% of its vote uncounted by the next day. If the race to control the House is close and certain California races are close, it\u2019s entirely possible those races will need to play out to determine control. Read more about what happens after Election Day here.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed how she got the news that her husband, Paul, had been attacked, telling CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that she was \u201cvery scared\u201d when there was a knock on the door from Capitol Police. Pelosi said in a new interview that she had been asleep in Washington, DC, after getting in the night before from San Francisco when her doorbell rang early in the morning. \u201cI look up, I see it\u2019s 5, they must be at the wrong apartment,\u201d she told Cooper after he asked where she was when she got the news. Pelosi went on to say that the doorbell rang again and then she heard \u201cbang, bang, bang, bang, bang on the door.\u201d \"So I run to the door, and I\u2019m very scared,\" Pelosi said, describing what unfolded. \"I see the Capitol Police and they say, 'We have to come in to talk to you.'\" Pelosi described how her thoughts went immediately to her children and her grandchildren. \"And I\u2019m thinking my children, my grandchildren. I never thought it would be Paul because, you know, I knew he wouldn\u2019t be out and about, shall we say. And so they came in. At that time, we didn\u2019t even know where he was,\" she said. Fear of increased political violence amid midterms: The violent attack on Paul Pelosi has raised fresh concerns over threats of political violence driven by partisan animosity and increasingly hostile political rhetoric \u2014 and highlighted the potential vulnerability of lawmakers and their families in the current political climate. Paul Pelosi was attacked with a hammer at the couple\u2019s home in San Francisco by a male assailant at the end of last month, authorities have said. The assailant who attacked him was searching for the speaker of the House, according to court documents. David DePape is charged with six counts relating to the attack, including attempted murder, burglary, assault, false imprisonment and threatening the family member of a public official. He has pleaded not guilty to all state charges. Following the attack, Paul Pelosi had surgery \u201cto repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,\u201d Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said in an earlier statement. He was released from the hospital last week. The Justice Department announced Monday the locations where it plans to send election monitors, a practice tracing back to the 1965 passage of the Voting Rights Act. The department will have monitors at election sites in 24 states. The monitors include personnel from the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division and from its US Attorneys\u2019 Offices. A Michigan judge has rejected a bid by the Republican candidate for Secretary of State, Kristina Karamo, to throw out absentee ballots in the city of Detroit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPlaintiffs have raised a false flag of election law violations and corruption concerning Detroit\u2019s procedures for the November 8th\u00a0election. This Court\u2019s ruling takes down that flag,\u201d Chief Judge Timothy Kenny of the Third Judicial Circuit Court of Michigan, wrote in an opinion dismissing the case. Specifically, Karamo\u2019s lawsuit alleged that procedures Detroit used to process absentee ballots violated Michigan election law. Karamo had\u00a0asked the court to exclude all absentee ballots that were obtained without identification and to stop the counting of ballots cast via inadequately monitored drop box locations. She was joined in the challenge, which made other allegations about Detroit\u2019s voting procedures, by\u00a0other individuals in the state as well as by the Election Integrity Fund and Force,\u00a0an outside group that has\u00a0pushed baseless claims about the 2020 election. Judge Kenny said Monday that granting that request would \u201cegregiously\u201d harm Detroit voters. \u201cWhile it is easy to hurl accusations of violations of law and corruption, it is another matter to come forward and produce the evidence our Constitution and laws require,\u201d Kenny wrote. \u201cPlaintiffs failed, in a full day of evidentiary hearing, to produce any shred of evidence.\u201d The Detroit City Clerk, responding to the lawsuit, said excluding those absentee ballots would disenfranchise at least 60,000 Detroit voters. More background: Scores of pre-election lawsuits have been filed in battleground states\u00a0ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, signaling the possibility of even more high-stakes and contentious court fights as voting wraps up and local officials start counting ballots. Much of the current litigation focuses on the processes surrounding how votes are cast and counted \u2013 with some lawsuits seizing on the same debunked conspiracy theories about election fraud that propelled the court efforts to overturn the 2020 election. ##Voting## Georgia has allowed vote tabulation to start on Election Day before polls close for years, however, few counties have executed that practice. Unlike previous elections though, many election officials are planning to get a head start. While results cannot be publicly reported to the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office until polls close at 7 p.m. ET under Georgia's law, some counties will be scanning and processing early voting and absentee ballots. County election officials who are involved with tabulating will be sequestered until polls close to prevent information leaks. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\u2019s office estimates that roughly one-third of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties will already be scanning and processing before the polls close.\u00a0 In addition, Georgia\u2019s voting law that passed last year requires that ballot counting \u201cshall not cease\u201d until completed.\u00a0A tally of all verified absentee ballots must be completed by 5 p.m. the day after Election Day. Here are the plans of the four biggest counties in Georgia. All times are ET. Fulton County\u00a0plans to begin scanning absentee ballots by mail at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday.\u00a0The early voting ballots will be scanned starting at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, according to a Fulton County spokesperson. Gwinnett County started scanning and processing absentee ballots and early ballots on Oct. 26. Officials will tabulate at some point on Election Day before 7 p.m. A later batch of ballots may come in on Election Day and will be reported at the end of the night.\u00a0\u00a0 DeKalb County\u00a0plans to start scanning absentee ballots at 3 p.m. on Election Day. Tabulations of both absentee and early voting ballots will begin at 7 p.m. on Tuesday after the polls close. Cobb County\u00a0has been processing and scanning absentee and early voting ballots for weeks.\u00a0Election officials open and scan absentee ballots as they come in but they are not uploaded into the secretary of state's system until 7 p.m. on Tuesday.\u00a0 ##Voting## Looking at tight races in battleground states, CNN's chief political analyst Gloria Borger said that voters' dissatisfaction with both major parties could lead to significant \"ballot splitting\" in key races. Some voters see the political landscape as \"Republicans may be threatening\u00a0democracy, but on the other\u00a0hand, Democrats are elite and\u00a0they don't understand any\u00a0problems,\" Borger said. \"And so they're not  \u2014\u00a0you know\u00a0they're not particularly\u00a0thrilled with either party and\u00a0they're worried, and I think\u00a0there are a lot of voters who are trying to figure out, do I\u00a0split my ballot? Do I vote one\u00a0Republican and one Democrat,\u00a0because I don't like the\u00a0candidates?\u00a0There is a cauldron here.\u00a0\" Borger told CNN's Kate Bolduan that states like Georgia and\u00a0Pennsylvania are both examples\u00a0of where ballot splitting could\u00a0be a real factor.\u00a0 \"Because for example, in Georgia,\u00a0you have a very popular\u00a0Republican governor and then you have Herschel\u00a0Walker on the same ticket.\u00a0So do people do straight tickets\u00a0or is there a camp [Raphael] Warnock\u00a0situation going on where you\u00a0vote for [Brian] Kemp for governor,\" Borger explained.  She continued: \"Same thing Pennsylvania as you point out \u2014 you have [Doug] Mastriano running for governor, very unpopular. What does that do to [Dr. Mehmet] Oz?\" CNN reported today that in Georgia, Republicans Walker and Kemp are set to hold separate campaign events. CNN political commentator Errol Louis said, \"I'm not sure I would want to campaign with Herschel Walker if I were Brian Kemp.\" \"Because if your argument to the\u00a0voters is that you're competent\u00a0and you're a good manager and\u00a0you could run the state, having\u00a0Herschel Walker standing next to\u00a0you kind of undermines that all the way\u00a0through,\" Louis added.  Louis called Walker \"almost a political science experiment\u00a0come to life.\" He asked, \"Will people simply vote on a party line\u00a0even for somebody who is\u00a0clearly unfit and unqualified?\u00a0It is a really interesting kind\u00a0of situation down there.\"\u00a0 \"And the fact that in some polls [Walker] has a\u00a0slight lead, really tells you there is quite a lot of partisanship, again that has nothing to do with the\u00a0operation of government,\" Louis said. ##Analysis## Fred and Linda Stone are supporting Republican Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate race on Tuesday, but they are also casting their votes against someone else: President Joe Biden. \u201cI just think our country would be better under Republican leadership,\u201d said Fred Stone, a Republican retiree from this Paulding County town northwest of Atlanta. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too much of a Trump supporter, but he was a businessman, the country was going the right way under him and now we\u2019re 180 degrees from where we were when he left office.\u201d The Stones believe Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is too closely associated with the policies of the Biden administration. They said he shares the blame on their economic challenges, particularly inflation at a four-decade high. As they waited for Walker to arrive at a campaign stop here Sunday afternoon, Linda Stone said she isn\u2019t a fan of politics and shies away from attending political rallies. But she said she wanted to show her support for Walker, who she believes has been subjected to an unfair campaign, in the wake of allegations he paid for abortions of former girlfriends. \u201cIt hurts my heart. I don\u2019t like that rhetoric. I\u2019d rather see positive things about all candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, it is what it is. I believe in Hershel Walker and I think he\u2019s going to see the people of Georgia make us proud.\u201d ##Voter Voices## This\u00a0Election Day, all types of weather including rain, snow, heat, cold and even tropical storm impacts are possible \u2013 depending on what region of the country you live in. Weather can actually play a role in voter turnout on Election Day. Some studies have found that\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0can motivate voters to get out to the polls \u2013 but\u00a0rain and snow\u00a0can deter them. So, here\u2019s your region-by-region forecast for Tuesday. Stormy and steamy in the South: In Florida, a tropical storm or hurricane is set to make landfall this week \u2013 which may bring impacts to the state starting on Election Day. If a hurricane happens, it would be unusual because one hasn\u2019t hit anywhere in the US in November in nearly 40 years. Nicole will bring rain and gusty winds to Florida and the Southeast coast beginning on Tuesday. It's forecast to strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall in Florida on Wednesday night. This means Election Day will be the last day for Florida residents to prepare before conditions begin deteriorating that night.\nA soaking rainout West: The West will win the prize for the worst Election Day weather. An area of low pressure will move onto the coast of California this week, spreading flooding rains, heavy snow, and gusty winds across much of the West.  Snow accumulation for central and northern Nevada will be up to 5 inches in the valleys and as much as 10 inches in the mountains, where winds will be gusting as high as 35 mph. Winter weather alerts and high wind alerts are up for much of the state. In California, this will be the first significant storm of the season and possibly\u00a0the most rainfall the state has seen since March.\nNortheast \u2014\u00a0Sunny and cool: We go from the worst weather to the best weather on Election Day, which will be found in the Northeast. A cold front will be passing through, putting an end to those record warm temperatures. Highs on Election Day will be in the 50s and low 60s for much of the Northeast. Bright sunshine should dominate.\nA new storm brewing in the Midwest: The area in the Midwest that will be the most impacted by weather on Election Day is Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. A storm system will begin moving in on Tuesday and will \u201cset the stage for what may end up being the most significant precipitation event we\u2019ve seen in the Twin Cities metro this entire year,\u201d the weather service office in Twin Cities said.The area could end up getting 2 to 3 inches of rain with this system on some of the most\u00a0drought-stricken areas. Read more about this here.  CNN Meteorologist\u00a0Haley Brink\u00a0contributed reporting to this post.  Former President Donald Trump is actively discussing announcing he is running for president in 2024 during his rally tonight in Ohio, three sources tell CNN. Whether he ultimately does remains to be seen \u2014 and sources strongly urged caution on whether he will \u2014 given he has been encouraged to wait until after the midterm elections and his daughter's upcoming wedding. But sources say Trump wants to get credit for a strong Republican showing in the midterm elections tomorrow should they retake control of the House or Senate.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s potential announcement date has been a moving target. CNN previously reportedTrump and his team had discussed the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 presidential campaign if Republicans fare well in the midterm elections. Trump has told aides and allies in the last week that he could announce at a rally in Ohio, two sources briefed on those conversations told CNN. As of Monday afternoon, the former president had not yet told his team whether he had made a firm decision and was still soliciting advice from close friends and advisers, one of the sources said. Trump has told allies that a surprise announcement in Ohio couldn't be used against him because the window for advertising has closed, sources said. Top Republicans had previously urged him to hold off on launching a presidential campaign before the midterms, fearing that Democrats would use him as a major foil in tight races. \"The DCCC can't go up on air and say, 'A vote for so and so is a vote for a Trump,'\" said one Trump adviser. More on tonight's rally: Trump is set to rally alongside Ohio Senate GOP hopeful JD Vance, one of his top midterm recruits whose victory he is eager to take credit for if Vance prevails against Democrat Tim Ryan on Tuesday. A Vance adviser said a Trump 2024 announcement wasn't a major concern for the campaign. Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes struck an optimistic tone a day before the election. \u201cI have gone into every election I've ever been in as the underdog, so this is no different,\u201d Barnes, who currently serves as Wisconsin's lieutenant governor, told reporters at a campaign canvas launch in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale. \u00a0 Barnes, who is locked in a neck-and-neck race with incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson, blasted his Republican opponent, noting Johnson\u2019s campaign ads have gone viciously negative in the closing days of the midterm elections. \u201cThe reality is, these commercials aren\u2019t talking about what a wonderful job Ron Johnson has done because, you know, that's too much of a lie for them to tell,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThe reality is he left us behind \u2014 he has no track record and no campaign to run on.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 And he touted the hard work his campaign has done in the final stretch. \u201cI can honestly say we\u2019ve done all that we could, and the most exciting and encouraging thing is that everything that everyone else has done\u2014this has been a grassroots campaign since the very start, grassroots is the core\u2014the amount of grassroots support that we have seen has not happened before here in the state,\u201d he told CNN.\u00a0 \u201cWe have been outspent by outside groups, the most expensive Senate race in the history of Wisconsin, but I can guarantee you, we have not been outworked. We\u2019re leaving no stone unturned, all gas, no brakes for the next 35 hours or so,\u201d he added.\u00a0 He attempted to downplay anxiety from Democratic voters who feel anxious as fluctuations in polling show Democrats on track to potentially lose both chambers of Congress on Tuesday. He urged those frustrated with polls to show up and vote. \u201cAnd if you're that frustrated, bring three more people with you to vote.\u201d ##Key Races## More than 41 million pre-election ballots have been cast across 47 states, according to data from elections officials, Edison Research and Catalist. Pre-election voting has been ahead of the 2018 pace across the states where data is available from\u00a0for the last three cycles. However, it\u2019s still too early to know if overall turnout will reach 2018 levels, as voting patterns may have changed in the last few years.\u00a0 Texas still has had the most pre-election votes, with more than 5.4 million ballots cast. Florida has had more than 4.7 million ballots cast and California has more than 4.1 million. Georgia, with more than 2.5 million ballots cast, and North Carolina, with more than 2.1 million, are the only other states with more than 2 million ballots cast so far.\u00a0 Some voter data comes from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and is giving insights into who is voting before November. ##Voting## White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield touted Joe Biden's accomplishments during his presidency, saying voters have to choose between the progress made by Democrats on gun reform, climate change and drug price or the vision that the Republicans offer. Notably, she did not mention election denialism among Republican candidates or the threat to Democracy that Democrats have campaigned on through this election cycle. \"Elections are a choice,\" she told CNN Monday. \"What the President has\u00a0done has gone out and made the\u00a0case that what Republicans have\u00a0put forward is a vision that\u00a0will provide tax breaks to the\u00a0wealthiest corporations. It will make\u00a0prescription drug costs go up\u00a0again. It will take away your right to\u00a0privacy, your right to choose. And it will reverse\u00a0the progress that we've made on\u00a0things like meaningful gun reform\u00a0legislation, which the President\u00a0was able to work with Congress\u00a0to get done.\" \"Americans have a choice between\u00a0continuing to take the country forward or\u00a0taking the country backward,\u00a0which frankly is what the\u00a0Republican agenda will do,\" she added. Bedingfield acknowledged that historically, a president's first midterm election \"could be challenging,\" but asserted that Biden has made progress on manufacturing jobs, the cost of prescription drugs, energy bills and tackling\u00a0climate change. \"If\u00a0you're wondering what the\u00a0President is going to do moving\u00a0forward, look at what he's\u00a0accomplished so far. You could see his priorities is\u00a0working families, creating\u00a0jobs and giving them breathing\u00a0room,\" she said. Watch Kate Bedingfield's full interview on CNN here: As votes roll in on Tuesday night, operatives from both parties will be looking toward the results of the tight New Hampshire Senate race to gauge how the rest of the night may look for them. When Don Bolduc unexpectedly won the state\u2019s late primary in September, Republicans were dour about their chances of unseating Democratic incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan, given the Republican candidate has struggled to raise money and took several far-right positions in the primary that they believed would hurt him in the general. Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, has proven resilient, however, aided by over $30 million in outside ad spending since Labor Day, putting him within striking distance of Hassan and worrying Democrats in the state. That tightness has operatives from both parties eying New Hampshire as a forerunner for how the rest of the night may go.\u00a0 \"The bellwether is New Hampshire,\" said Chris Hartline, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"If it becomes pretty clear by 9 or 10 o\u2019clock that we are going to win New Hampshire,\" Hartline said, then the GOP \u201calmost definitely\u201d would carry other key Senate contests including Pennsylvania and Georgia, setting the party up to retake the majority. A Democratic operative in New Hampshire acknowledged that even while the Hassan campaign \u201cfeel good\u201d about her chance of winning reelection on Tuesday, \u201cit is going to be a close race.\u201d But the operative also echoed Hartline, arguing the state will provide a guidepost for how the night will be for each party. \u201cIt will be pretty clear how things are going. Early on Tuesday night, you will start to get a sense,\u201d said the operative. \u201cIf we are winning by a lot or if it is closer, that will be a measure.\u201d  Secretary of state contests \u2014 typically low-profile races that determine who helps administer elections in a state \u2013 have drawn national attention and\u00a0millions of dollars in political spending this year\u00a0as several Republican nominees who doubt the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election pursue the jobs. In all, voters in 27 states will choose secretaries of state in the midterms. Fourteen of those seats currently are held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats. But the presence of election deniers on general election ballots in key battlegrounds has set off alarms for voting rights advocates because of the pivotal role these offices will play in affirming the outcome of future elections, including a potential 2024 rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. And Trump, who attempted to pressure public officials to set aside the will of voters after he lost the presidency, has championed their candidacies. \u201cEven one being elected would be terrifying enough in a swing state,\u201d said Nick Penniman, the founder and CEO of Issue One, a nonprofit group tracking these races. \u201cWe know that elections in America come down to 300,000 votes stretched across five or six swing states, so every vote counts.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at some key 2022 secretary of state races:  Arizona: In Arizona \u2013 where election conspiracy theories have flourished ever since Biden won this traditionally red state by fewer than 11,000 votes two years ago \u2013 Republican voters picked state Rep. Mark Finchem as their standard-bearer. Finchem, who has\u00a0described himself as a member of the far-right Oath Keeper\u2019s group, scored\u00a0Trump\u2019s endorsement\u00a0back in September 2021. The GOP lawmaker has lobbied to toss out the results of the 2020 election in some of the state\u2019s largest counties \u2013 including Maricopa, home to Phoenix, where a widely derided review of ballots ordered by Republicans in the state Senate still concluded that Biden had won more votes than Trump did. Georgia: The Georgia contest features one of the country\u2019s best-known election chiefs \u2013 Republican Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump\u2019s request to \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his loss in the Peach State. (That campaign by Trump and his allies is the subject of a special grand jury investigation in Fulton County, Georgia.) Michigan: The race pits the incumbent, Democrat Jocelyn Benson \u2013 a leading national voice countering election denial \u2013 against Republican Kristina Karamo,\u00a0who has made false claims\u00a0about the 2020 election and who was behind the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Karamo, a community college professor who secured an endorsement from Trump last year, has said he won the election, and she signed on to an unsuccessful Supreme Court lawsuit that challenged Biden\u2019s victory in four states. Read about other key secretary of state races here.  No Senate race in the country has received as much money and attention as the hotly contested and at-times divisive contest between Republican Mehmet Oz and Democrat John Fetterman in Pennsylvania. And with over one million ballots already cast and Election Day just hours away, the reason is clear: Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement in a state President Joe Biden won two years ago has created Democrats' best opportunity to pick up a seat and save their narrow majority. For Republicans, holding the seat is key to toppling that majority. \"This is a must-win race,\" said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC that has blanketed the state with tens of millions in ads attacking Fetterman. \"We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority.\" With even upbeat Democrats conceding the party is unlikely to keep control of the House on Tuesday, Senate control is arguably the most closely watched battle on Election Day. Republicans only need a net gain of one seat. Democrats are focused on protecting incumbents in Nevada, Arizona, New Hampshire and Georgia and possibly flipping seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio. But it is the race in Pennsylvania that both parties view as critical. From Labor Day through Election Day, nearly $160 million will be spent on ads by both parties, more than any other Senate race, according to ad tracker AdImpact. \"The bottom line is if Democrats are able to flip a current Republican-held seat, there is likely no path for the Republicans to get to 51 votes in the Senate,\" said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania. \"It gives the Democrats some breathing room because if one of the incumbents goes down, this is the buffer. And the inverse is true. If for some reason we can't win here, it is going to be a bad night in multiple states.\" That importance was clear as Oz and Fetterman crisscrossed the commonwealth in the final week of campaigning, trying to appeal to last-minute voters and urging people who have long decided who they're voting for to now get their friends and family to the polls. \"It's a jump ball,\" Fetterman said bluntly on Sunday in Harrisburg. \"On Tuesday, it's going to come down to every single vote.\" \"I have one job. ... Win this race. You are the key,\" Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the head of the Republican committee tasked with taking control of the Senate, said introducing Oz on Thursday. \"You want a majority in the Senate? Yes. It comes right through Pennsylvania.\" CNN\u2019s Kit Maher contributed to this report. ##Key Races## The first statewide polls will close Tuesday night at 7 p.m. ET, and there may be some early clues about how things could unfold.  CNN political director David Chalian breaks down what to watch for as polls begin to close:  Republican Mike Lawler, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in the New York suburbs, doubled down on his criticism of Democrats\u2019 handling of crime in an interview Monday on CNN. \u201cWhen people are saying they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d Lawler said, \u201cit\u2019s because they\u2019re not safe.\u201d Lawler, a state assemblyman from Rockland County, New York, is in a tight race with Maloney, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, in the newly drawn 17th Congressional District. The contest has attracted national attention \u2013 and cash \u2013 as Republicans look to make headlines by ousting one of the most powerful Democrats on Capitol Hill. The GOP\u2019s leading House super PAC has spent nearly $10 million on the race. Maloney, who lives in the district, but is new to more than 70% of its constituents, has been hobbled by the new map \u2013 which only came about after a judge threw out a gerrymandered draft and called on an independent \u201cspecial master\u201d to draw up the one now being used. For that reason, Lawler said Maloney largely \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the built-in advantages of incumbency.\u201d For his part, Maloney has called Lawler \u201cMAGA Mike,\u201d seeking to tie him to former President Donald Trump, and warned that, despite Lawler\u2019s protests, the Republican would be a vote against abortion rights. \u201cI am against a national ban on abortion,\u201d Lawler said when asked whether he would vote for federal legislation banning the procedure. \u201cI will be a Republican that represents everyone.\u201d\u00a0 Maloney's challenge mirrors those facing so many other Democrats in New York and around the country. Republicans have seized on concerns over rising inflation and public safety, their message juiced by Biden's low approval ratings and widespread frustration and angst over a pandemic that, more than two years after it began, continues to wreak havoc on the economy. If Maloney falls, not only will Republicans be able to boast about taking down the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in his own backyard, but they will almost surely be on their way to an Election Day evisceration of Democrats' House majority.\u00a0 On Election Day Eve, President Joe Biden will headline a political rally in Maryland where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wes Moore looks poised to become the state\u2019s first Black governor. That final campaign swing before Election Day comes after Biden spent the weekend in New York stumping for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, and making yet\u00a0another visit to Pennsylvania\u00a0to prop up Democrats including gubernatorial nominee Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who is running for Senate in one of the country\u2019s most closely watched races. All of those Democrats have one notable thing in common: they are all taking on Republican opponents who are known election deniers \u2013 or, at the very least, have demonstrated skepticism about the results of the 2020 election. And that's a dynamic that Biden has made a central theme of his political rallying cry in the final stretch before Tuesday. He delivered a speech last week near Capitol Hill \u2013 where a mob of election deniers breached the legislative building to try to prevent members of Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election. He called out the numerous Republican candidates on the ballot this week who question the legitimacy of the last \u2013 and possibly also this week\u2019s \u2013 election. But with control of Congress hanging in the balance, some Democratic strategists have criticized the focus in the final stretch of the campaign on issues related to election integrity as a mistake, given that voters overwhelmingly consider the economy and inflation as their top concern. Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Hilary Rosen predicted on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Democrats would have a \u201cbad night\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 in no small part because, she said, Democrats had failed to listen to voters. \u201cWhen voters tell you over and over and over again that they care mostly about the economy, listen to them. Stop talking about democracy being at stake,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cDemocracy is at stake because people are fighting so much about what elections mean. I mean, voters have told us what they wanted to hear and I don\u2019t think Democrats have really delivered this cycle.\u201d In a recent CNN poll, 51% of likely voters said the economy and inflation would be most important to them in their congressional vote, far outpacing any other issue. In comparison, just 9% of likely voters, including 15% of Democrats, called \u201cvoting rights and election integrity\u201d their top issue. Watch here: Democrats won the Senate after flipping Georgia last year and the state could be pivotal once again in the 2022 midterm elections. For the second time in less than two years,\u00a0the Peach State, which elected two Democratic senators in the last election cycle, is home to a contest that has gripped both national parties and potentially holds the key to the fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda.  This time around, though, at least one key characteristic of the race has been reversed: Democrat Raphael Warnock has gone from challenger to incumbent, trying to fend off Republican nominee Herschel Walker. The former football great, recruited and endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has run an uneven campaign and spent the past month beset by controversy, but is still running neck-and-neck with Warnock with early voting in high gear and Election Day nearing. A Warnock victory would likely foreclose Republicans\u2019 path to a majority in the Senate, which is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting a decisive vote. That reality, coupled with headwinds \u2013 in the form of economic angst and Biden\u2019s low approval ratings \u2013 familiar to Democrats across the country, has helped coalesce Republicans behind Walker. Underscoring his party\u2019s mix of ambivalence and political practicality, former Vice President Mike Pence, after not mentioning Walker during his remarks at a rally in Cumming, Georgia, on Tuesday for GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, told reporters he is \u201csupporting the whole (Republican) ticket here in Georgia.\u201d Read more here.  ##Key Races## More than 3,400 mail-in ballots risk being rejected because of incorrect information, missing dates or missing secrecy envelopes, election officials in Philadelphia said on Saturday. Philadelphia City Commissioners\u2019 Chairwoman\u00a0Lisa Deeley\u00a0released the affected voters\u2019 names and urged them to take immediate steps to get replacement ballots. Officials say the numbers of at-risk ballots will grow as more are returned. The action by Deeley comes after the state Supreme Court on Tuesday\u00a0barred local election officials\u00a0from counting ballots with missing or incorrect dates on the return envelope. On Sunday, Allegheny County also\u00a0published\u00a0two lists of voters, totaling more than 1,000, who returned mail-in and absentee ballots with no date or with an incorrect date, as defined by the supreme court\u2019s order. Voters in Allegheny County can fix their ballots at the County Office Building in downtown Pittsburgh on Monday and Tuesday. Why the state is key: A highly competitive US Senate race that could decide control of the chamber is on the ballot in this key swing state, along with a closely watched contest for governor. Currently, more than 1,800 of the ballots flagged by Philadelphia authorities lack the required dates. Election officials in Philadelphia say their city hall office will be open Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to help voters fix the problem. Voters in Allegheny County can fix their ballots at the County Office Building in downtown Pittsburgh on Monday and Tuesday. Pennsylvania\u2019s requirement that voters sign and provide a handwritten date on their ballot return envelope has been the subject of litigation for months. And on Friday, several Pennsylvania groups, including the state branches of the NAACP and the League of Women Voters, filed a lawsuit in\u00a0federal court, challenging the state\u2019s plan to not count undated ballots. The lawsuit calls a missing or incorrect date \u201ca meaningless technicality\u201d and argues that throwing out a ballot on those grounds violates federal civil rights law. ##Voting## Rep. Tom Malinowski, a Democrat from New Jersey, on Monday expressed criticism of President Joe Biden's decision to visit Saudi Arabia, saying that he made \"a bit of a mistake.\" \"One issue I've had with President Biden on gas prices, on oil, is that I think he made a bit of a mistake going to Saudi\u00a0Arabia this summer and trying the nice approach with a so-called ally that actually is trying to deliberately hurt the United States right now,\"\u00a0Malinowski, who is\u00a0in a tight race for reelection to represent New Jersey's 7th\u00a0District, said during an interview on \"CNN This Morning.\" The New Jersey congressman's comments came when asked what he would do differently than the Biden administration to address inflation if he is reelected.\u00a0 \"I think we, and he, learned a lesson when Saudi Arabia acted to raise gas prices to help Russia, to hurt us, a couple of months ago I had legislation in the House to require withdrawing our troops from Saudi Arabia as a consequence of that decision,\" Malinowski said.\u00a0 Watch here: Sometimes you hit the campaign trail and there is an issue voters care so much about, that its dominance is inescapable. In 2006, it was growing opposition to the Iraq war. In 2010, it was the backlash against big government spending and bailouts coupled with fear about what Obamacare would look like. This year, it is deep concern about affordability. That is not to say that other issues, from abortion to crime to the climate and beyond, don\u2019t matter a lot to voters \u2013 but anxiety about the high cost of the basics is palpable. We learned that after traveling to five pivotal states since Labor Day weekend:\u00a0Michigan,\u00a0Ohio,\u00a0Virginia, Nevada and\u00a0Arizona. We covered competitive races and talked to scores of voters in diners, gas stations, grocery store parking lots, construction sites, outdoor markets and more. \u201cI drive a truck and it does not get very good gas mileage. I actually had to quit my last job because I couldn\u2019t afford to drive all the way out there,\u201d Amanda Cleaver told us at the Michigan State Fair on Labor Day weekend. Greg Steyer, as he sat with a group of friends at Bud\u2019s Restaurant in Defiance, Ohio, expressed his exasperation as well. \u201cWhy is the price of gas where it is today?\u201d Steyer asked the second week of September. \u201cYou can\u2019t just overlook that issue,\u201d he added. As Joseph San Clemente put his groceries in his car in a Virginia Beach parking lot in late September, he couldn\u2019t get over the prices of what he had just purchased. \u201cVegetables have gone up 20 to 30%,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowers locally in the farms are not carrying things they did last year because people don\u2019t have the money.\u201d Dave Dent, who manages a construction company in Tucson, Arizona, said in late October that inflation in his line of work is as high as 30%. And Maria Melgoza, who cleans homes in Las Vegas, told us how hard it is to make ends meet these days. \u201cFood is high, gas is high, rent is high,\u201d she said, speaking in Spanish. We heard from many frustrated voters \u2013 especially those among the working class and in rural areas - who feel forgotten by politicians in Washington. \u201cI came up in a union household. My dad was a teamster for 30 years, voted Democrat. But they\u2019re completely out of touch with what everyday Americans want,\u201d lamented Jason Fetke in Virginia Beach. A current union member we met in Toledo, Ohio, says he is voting for Democrats this year, but still feels like neither party is doing enough. \u201cI think there should be a lot more focus on working class people,\u201d said Joe Stallbaum. \u201cIt just seems like we always get left behind for either the high or the low,\u201d he added. Keep reading here.  ##Voter Voices## Among the numerous\u00a0initiatives on the ballot\u00a0Tuesday are a host of measures related to health care and finances. Here's a sampling of those ballot measures: Expanding Medicaid in South Dakota: Currently, childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid in South Dakota, and parents must have very low incomes to qualify \u2014 about $1,000 a month for a family of four. By expanding Medicaid, South Dakota will receive an additional $328 million in federal funds the first year and generate 4,000 new jobs, according to Zach Marcus, campaign manager for South Dakotans Decide Healthcare, which is advocating for the ballot measure. The state's Legislative Research Council found last year that expansion would save South Dakota $162.5 million over five years. Many Republican officials oppose the measure, citing its potential future costs. States are responsible for picking up 10% of the health care tab of the expansion enrollees. Raising the minimum wage in Nebraska and Nevada: Nebraska voters will decide whether to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026, up from the current $9 an hour. In Nevada, voters will have their say on a state constitutional amendment to increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2024. The measure would also remove an existing provision setting different rates for the minimum wage based on whether the employer offers certain health benefits. Currently, the state minimum wage is set to rise to $12 an hour for workers who don't receive certain health benefits and $11 an hour for those who\u00a0do\u00a0in 2024. Increasing taxes on the rich in California and Massachusetts: California's Proposition 30 would add a surtax of 1.75% on people making more than $2 million a year. This is on top of the state's highest income tax rate of 12.3%. It would raise an estimated $3.5 billion to $5 billion. Most of the funds would go to promote\u00a0zero-emission vehicles\u00a0and\u00a0wildfire prevention and control. The Massachusetts ballot measure, meanwhile, would impose a 4% surtax on those who earn more than $1 million. That's on top of the state's existing 5% income tax rate. It would raise about $1.3 billion in 2023 and affect about 0.6% of state residents, according to a\u00a0Tufts University estimate. The money from Question 1 would go to fund education, roads, bridges and public transit. Adding medical debt measures in Arizona: Voters will decide whether to change some rules governing\u00a0medical debt\u00a0owed by residents. Proposition 209 would cap the interest rate on medical debt at 3% and limit wage garnishment for medical debt to a maximum of 30% of earnings. It would also increase the value of primary residences and cars that would be protected from medical debt collectors to $400,000 and $15,000, respectively, up from $250,000 and $6,000, said Rodd McLeod, spokesperson for Healthcare Rising Arizona, which is supporting the measure that is also backed by The Fairness Project. The bill does not forgive any medical debt, McLeod said. Even as the odds of House Democrats keeping their majority worsen, the Senate has remained more of a nail-biter. That alone has been encouraging for Democrats. But in a Senate chamber that\u2019s evenly split, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote, Democrats have zero room for error as they look to prevent the GOP from gaining a two-chamber congressional majority and launching even more of the kinds of investigations that Republicans have already pledged to open if they win the House. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to win the Senate majority \u2013 with Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire among their key pickup opportunities. All of those races have tightened in their favor since the summer, including New Hampshire, which had appeared out of the GOP\u2019s reach when the party nominated a more extreme candidate who had raised just a fraction of Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan\u2019s millions. What the GOP needs: For Republicans to pick up seats, though, they need to defend their own, including two in states Donald Trump won in 2020 but that have required more GOP spending than Republicans would have liked. While Republicans pummel Democrats over inflation and crime, Democrats\u2019 strategy has been to try to paint contrasts between their candidates and the GOP \u2013 over issues of both character and policy, such as their late campaign charge that Republicans would endanger Social Security and Medicare. Senate races can defy the national environment. House races \u2013 in which candidates are much less defined \u2013 tend to blow with the national winds. The 2018 blue wave, for example \u2013 when Democrats made significant gains in the House in response to Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 didn\u2019t translate to the Senate. Republicans were able to pick up seats that year by knocking off some Democrats in red states. But the question this year is whether the idiosyncrasies of Senate races can outweigh voters\u2019 dismal perceptions of the economy and the desire to check the party in power in the White House. Nearly three-quarters of voters in a recent CNN/SSRS survey said things in the country were going in the wrong direction, with about the same percentage believing the US is already in a recession. ##Key Races## In Tuesday's midterm elections, Democrats are hoping to hold on to power, while Republicans yearn to gain control of both the House and the Senate. And while we all have guesses of what will happen, the truth is that we don\u2019t know what will play out.\u00a0 With that uncertainty in mind, here are three different scenarios that could be key to how the battle for control shakes out.\u00a0 Georgia runoff determines Senate: If you follow politics to any degree, you certainly have. Unlike other states with close Senate races, Georgia requires candidates to receive a majority of the vote to win on Election Day. If no candidate does, then a runoff between the top two candidates is held in December.\u00a0 The conditions are fairly ripe for such a scenario. Neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican Herschel Walker is at 50% in the Georgia Senate polls. Libertarian Chase Oliver is pulling in 3% to 4%.\u00a0 If every other race goes exactly as the polls predict, Democrats will have 49 seats, not including Georgia. Republicans will have 50 seats. This means that whichever side wins in Georgia would control the Senate.\u00a0 The Senate actually gets projected early: Then there\u2019s the other side of the spectrum. Most people are anticipating that we won\u2019t know who wins the Senate until days, if not weeks, after Election Day. That may be the case, but it\u2019s far from a certainty.\u00a0 There are a few ways we could conceivably get a fairly fast call. The easiest way for it to happen is if the Republicans win both Georgia (with a majority to avoid a runoff) and Pennsylvania. That way, we\u2019re probably not reliant on what could be longer counts in Arizona and Nevada.\u00a0 Another way this might happen is if there is a surprising result in the east. If Republicans have a very good night, they could win the New Hampshire Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is running for reelection against Republican Don Bolduc. If Democrats have a very good night, they could win the Ohio Senate race, an open seat where Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is facing off with Trump-endorsed J.D. Vance.\u00a0 An early call of the House: Just weeks ago, the race for both the House and Senate looked close. While the Senate still does, it\u2019s easy to see how the House could turn into a relative blowout.\u00a0 If that happens, we won\u2019t have to wait for the West Coast. We won\u2019t have to wait for the results from ranked-choice voting races.\u00a0 Instead, we\u2019ll get a pretty good idea from even the earliest of poll closings. Consider a race like that for Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, a swing district centered in Virginia Beach. Rep. Elaine Luria would likely win if Democrats are to be competitive in the House. If she\u2019s defeated, Republicans are probably on their way to House control.\u00a0 If it\u2019s a big Republican night, we could also see Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan go down in Indiana. Indiana, unlike a lot of other states, requires voters to have an excuse to vote absentee.\u00a0The bottom line is that if Republicans end up with close to 240 seats (as they did in 2010), then the race for House control won\u2019t be drawn out.\u00a0 Read more potential Election Day scenarios here.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Analysis## Misinformation about voting has grown rampant in the last two years and confidence in elections has fallen. CNN asked an official in the key swing state of Arizona to respond directly to questions from supporters of Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. That elections official is a Republican: Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates. He addressed the verification process for mail ballots, the screening measures for election workers, the accuracy of vote-counting machines and more. For years, Twitter has been a leader in countering misinformation and protecting elections. It was often ahead of its peers in creating and enforcing new policies, and it was the first major platform\u00a0to ban former President Donald Trump\u00a0after the Capitol insurrection, pushing others to follow suit. But concerns are growing that tumult inside Twitter in the first week after it was acquired by Elon Musk could weaken its safeguards for elections, just before the midterms are set to take place. Musk\u2019s Twitter laid off thousands of employees\u00a0across the company last week, including cuts to its public policy and trust and safety teams, and extensive cuts to its curation team, which helps elevate reliable information on the platform about elections and other news events. The chaos was only amplified over the weekend as Twitter first appeared to roll out,\u00a0and then postponed, a controversial plan allowing any user to pay to be verified \u2014 a proposal critics had said would cause confusion during the midterms about which accounts and tweets users could trust. The threats Twitter could face on Election Day and its aftermath include known risks, such as misleading claims of election fraud, attempts at voter intimidation or violent rhetoric, Barrett said. But the disarray at Twitter also means the company will be even less equipped to identify and counter novel manipulation tactics for which there is no playbook, he added. Twitter has said it\u2019s still committed to protecting elections and that the job cuts last week \u2014 which struck half of the company\u2019s workforce \u2014 were less extensive in its trust and safety team, where about 15% of workers were let go. But the company has been largely opaque about how exactly the layoffs may hinder Twitter\u2019s ability to combat misinformation. CNN\u2019s Clare Duffy and Donie O\u2019Sullivan contributed to this report. With all 435 House races, 35 Senate races and 36 governors\u2019 races on ballots across the country, it\u2019s hard to know where to look on\u00a0Election Day\u00a0to get a sense of just what kind of night it is going to be. Below are my picks for races worth watching \u2013 not just for their outcomes, but for what they can tell us about the national playing field. The races are listed alphabetically. * Connecticut\u2019s 5th District: Connecticut is not a battleground state, but this race has become indicative of the struggles some Democratic incumbents are having in New England. Rep. Jahana Hayes has held the western Connecticut seat since 2018 and was reelected in 2020 with 55% of the vote as Joe Biden was carrying the district in the presidential race with roughly the same vote share. Republicans, however, have been bullish for a while about their nominee, George Logan. The former state senator is vying to become the first Republican to represent the district in about 16 years.\u00a0Inside Elections\u00a0rates the race a\u00a0Toss-up. If Republicans win here, it is\u00a0likely a sign\u00a0that they are cruising to the majority nationwide. * Michigan Governor:\u00a0Michigan\u00a0has been one of the top swing states in the country over the past two national elections, but Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer looks like a favorite here in her race against Republican Tudor Dixon, who won a contested primary fight thanks to the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. Dixon has struggled to stay financially competitive with Whitmer since winning the nomination. Polls suggest this race is Whitmer\u2019s to lose, but keep an eye on the margin. If she wins by low single-digits, it would suggest an overperformance by Dixon that could affect races down-ballot. * New Hampshire Senate: After retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc became the Republican nominee earlier this fall, it appeared as though national GOP groups were giving up on the race. The super PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pulled out\u00a0more than $5 million in planned advertising\u00a0in the state, and it appeared as though Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan was on her way to victory. But the National Republican Senatorial Committee jumped\u00a0back into the race\u00a0and Democrats\u2019 Senate Majority PAC added money to its ad reservation over the final week of the campaign, suggesting that this is a\u00a0closer contest than expected. If Bolduc manages to win, you can be almost certain that Republicans will regain the majority in the Senate. * New York 17th\u2019s District: This is where Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who also happens to be the chair of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, is running for reelection. The early spending in the race by Republicans seemed to be nothing more than a troll move designed to annoy and distract Maloney from other races around the country. Then, like so many races in the Northeast of late,\u00a0it turned competitive. GOP state Assemblyman Mike Lawler has stayed within striking distance. Inside Elections recently moved its rating of this race to\u00a0Toss-up, a sign that the momentum is with Republicans. If Lawler is able to pull off the upset, it will be doubly sweet for his party \u2013 they will pick up a seat no one expected\u00a0and\u00a0take out a member of Democratic leadership in the process. Here are more races to watch for. ##Analysis##   House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is vowing to secure the border, cut back on government spending and launch rigorous investigations into the Biden administration if Republicans win the House on Tuesday, reflecting a mix of priorities as McCarthy will be forced to contend with an increasingly hardline and pro-Trump conference that is itching to impeach President Joe Biden.\u00a0 In an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security \u2014three issues that have become central to Republicans' closing pitch to voters. To hammer home that message, McCarthy \u2014who has been barnstorming the country in the run-up to the midterms \u2013\u00a0rallied here on Sunday for a trio of Hispanic GOP women who are vying to represent key districts along the southern border, a key part of the party's strategy for winning the majority. \u00a0\"The first thing you'll see is a bill to control the border first,\" McCarthy told CNN, when asked for specifics about his party's immigration plans. \"You've got to get control over the border. You've had almost 2 million people just this year alone coming across.\" The Biden administration continues to rely on a Trump-era pandemic emergency rule, known as Title 42, that allows border authorities to turn migrants away at the US-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2022, amid mass migration in the Western hemisphere, US border encounters topped 2 million, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. Of those, more than 1 million were turned away under Title 42.\u00a0 But McCarthy also highlighted oversight and investigations as a key priority for a GOP-led House, listing potential probes into the chaotic Afghanistan pullout, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the administration has dealt with parents and school board meetings. And he left the door open to launching eventual impeachment proceedings, which some of his members have already begun to call for. \"We will never use impeachment for political purposes,\" McCarthy said. \"That doesn't mean if something rises to the occasion, it would not be used at any other time.\" And with the MAGA-wing calling to cut off funding to Ukraine while the GOP's defense hawks vow not to abandon the country amid its war with Russia, McCarthy attempted to reaffirm his support for Ukraine while saying they would not automatically rubber stamp any additional requests for aid. \u00a0Read the full story here.  Scores of pre-election lawsuits have been filed in battleground states ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, signaling the possibility of even more high-stakes and contentious court fights as voting wraps up and local officials start counting ballots. Much of the current litigation focuses on the processes surrounding how votes are cast and counted \u2013 with some lawsuits seizing on the same debunked conspiracy theories about election fraud that propelled the court efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In all, 120 cases surrounding voting had been filed as of Nov. 3 \u2013 more than half of which have sought to restrict access to the ballot\u2013 according to the\u00a0Democracy Docket, a liberal-leaning voting rights and media platform that tracks election litigation. By comparison, 68 election lawsuits had been filed before Election Day in 2020, the group said. \u201cWhat we saw in 2020 was this effort to undermine the elections, but, for the most part, it happened after the elections,\u201d said Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at the organization Common Cause, which advocates on democracy issues. \u201cThis time what we are seeing is the prep beforehand.\u201d Some of the cases have been brought by the same fringe legal groups that sought to bolster former President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to overturn his 2020 electoral loss. But a significant portion of the pre-election litigation \u2013 about 1 in 5 of the cases that seek new restrictions \u2013 have been brought by state GOP committees or the Republican National Committee, according to Democracy Docket. The RNC has sought to build out its operations around monitoring elections after being sidelined from that work with a court consent decree that expired in 2018. RNC officials say they are trying to ensure that their party has robust representation in how Tuesday\u2019s elections are run and the votes counted. The court fights over the midterms may play a pivotal role in determining the winners in this week\u2019s elections and even, perhaps, the balance of power in Washington. They also could set the ground rules for the 2024 presidential election, as the parties and outside groups test their strategies for when Trump \u2013 whose lies about a stolen 2020 election have shaped the current legal environment \u2013 could be on the ballot again. ##Voting## On a frenetic final weekend of campaigning, President Biden and former President Barack Obama tried to push Democratic nominee John Fetterman over the line in a Pennsylvania Senate race that represents the party\u2019s best chance to pick up a GOP-held Senate seat. But Democrats are under fierce pressure in states like Arizona and Nevada that could flip the chamber to the GOP. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to win the majority. Democrats are playing defense in blue-state strongholds like New York, Washington and Oregon and are waging a longshot struggle to\u00a0cling to the House of Representatives. Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to win back control. A handful of swing state showdowns will decide the destiny of the Senate, currently split 50-50, including in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Republicans are also showing renewed interest in\u00a0the race in New Hampshire\u00a0between Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, a pro-Trump candidate Democrats brand as an election-denying extremist. The President warned in a speech in Pittsburgh on Saturday night alongside Obama that Republican concern over the economy was a ruse and claimed that the GOP would cut Social Security and Medicare if they won majorities. The midterms are the first national vote since the chaos and violence triggered by Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the result of the last presidential election and there are already fears that some Republican candidates may follow his example and try to defy the will of voters if they don\u2019t win. Some, like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, have already raised concerns about the integrity of the vote. With Americans struggling under the high cost of living, there is growing second guessing over Democrats\u2019 strategy and whether they are talking effectively about the issues voters care about most. Biden\u2019s closing message on saving democracy from pro-Trump candidates might be an accurate reflection of fresh threats posed by the ex-president and his acolytes. But it does nothing to ease fears about the cost of groceries or a gallon of gas. Biden, however, has not managed to speak effectively and personally to Americans craving a return to normality after the pandemic or to get across that he fully understands the pain of rising prices in a 40-year-high inflation explosion that his White House once repeatedly branded \u201ctransitory.\u201d If Republicans win back the House, they can impose a vise on Biden\u2019s legislative program and set up a series of perilous political showdowns on spending and raising the debt-ceiling. They are promising a relentless round of investigations and hearings into everything from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the surge in migrants across the southern border to Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. This midterm election, the balance of power for both chambers of Congress are on the line. This could influence how easy it is for either political party to get things done during the legislative session.\u00a0 So, with just days until Tuesday's Election Day, here are the answers to some basic questions a lot of people might be asking:\u00a0 What is the balance of power?\u00a0 Political parties have more power when they control the House or Senate by winning a majority of the seats in that chamber. The party in power controls committees that write legislation and decides which measures will get a vote on the floor. In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, the party with 51 votes has the majority.\u00a0 Why are all 435 House members up for election every two years?\u00a0 The House of Representatives is the piece of the federal government that is closest to the people. Putting House members up for election every two years allows voters more direct and immediate control of the direction of their government.\u00a0 What is a \u201cflipped seat\u201d or \u201cpickup\u201d?\u00a0 A flipped seat or pickup is one in the House or Senate that voters take from one party and entrust to the other party. Because of redistricting, nine House seats \u2013 including seven new seats where there is no incumbent and two where two incumbents are running against each other \u2013 cannot be classified as pickups for either party.\u00a0 Will we know who wins on Election Day?\u00a0 Don\u2019t count on final answers in every race on election night. With so many people voting early and by mail and so many close elections, there\u2019s a good chance that it will take days or weeks to figure out who won some races. The margins of power in both the House and Senate are close enough that it could take days to know who will have a majority of seats. ##Key Races##\u00a0 More than 40 million pre-election ballots have been cast in 47 states, according to data from elections officials, Edison Research and Catalist. Pre-election voting has been ahead of the 2018 pace across the states where data is available for the last three cycles. However, it\u2019s still too early to know if overall turnout will reach 2018 levels, as voting patterns may have changed in the last few years. Texas still has had the most pre-election votes, with more than 5.4 million ballots cast. Florida has had more than 4.5 million ballots cast and California has more than 4.1 million.  Georgia, with more than 2.5 million ballots cast, and North Carolina, with more than 2.1 million, are the only other states with more than 2 million ballots cast so far. That early turnout number in Georgia set a new state record for a midterm election.

  "text": "The man alleged to have attacked Paul Pelosi on Friday morning is expected to be arraigned Tuesday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins\u00a0tweeted Friday evening. \u00a0David DePape is accused of entering Pelosi's house and hitting him with a hammer. \u201cWe are coordinating closely with federal and local law enforcement partners on this investigation. We will bring forward multiple felony charges on Monday and expect DePape to be arraigned on Tuesday. DePape will be held accountable for his heinous crimes,\u201d she wrote. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said the suspect is still in the hospital, as of Friday night, but will be booked into jail on felony charges. Authorities in San Francisco are appealing to the public to provide tips regarding the attack against Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 \u201cWhile an arrest has been made, this remains an open investigation,\u201d the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement.\u00a0 Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Tip Line at 1-415-575-4444. People can also text TIP411 and begin a message with the police department, the statement said. \"You may remain anonymous,\" police said. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott praised the quick-thinking dispatcher who sent police officers to the Pelosi home Friday, after the House speaker's husband made a surreptitious 911 call.  \"When\u00a0you have an experienced\u00a0dispatcher with good instincts,\u00a0they learn how to read between\u00a0the lines,\" Scott told reporters. The dispatcher in question got a call from Paul Pelosi, who managed to leave the line open while he confronted an intruder in his home. Pelosi was talking in code, a law enforcement source told CNN earlier today, providing enough detail that the operator could understand something was wrong. At the same time, Pelosi tried not to make it evident that he had an open line. \"She knew something more was going on, just in her heart and her\u00a0intuition, just with her\u00a0experience,\" Scott said.\u00a0\"And that calls for a higher\u00a0priority than this type of call\u00a0normally receives.\u00a0This was a well-being check.\u00a0And she just knew there was more to\u00a0it. So she alerted our officers, she went that extra step ... and that led to a quicker response.\" David DePape, the man suspected of attacking Paul Pelosi earlier Friday, is still being treated in the hospital,\u00a0San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said during a press conference this evening. Scott did not elaborate on how DePape was hurt, but officers say they witnessed a struggle for control of a hammer between Pelosi and an intruder when they first arrived at the home. While Scott did not discuss the suspect's medical condition, he did tell reporters that DePape will be booked on felony charges. \u201cThe suspect is still in the hospital, but let me say this: we intend to book the suspect, whether it\u2019s in absentia or whether it\u2019s in person \u2014 he will be booked for felony charges,\u201d he said. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said the attack at the Pelosi home was a targeted act of violence, not random, and shared an emotional rebuke of any threat on a public figure's life. \"This was not a random act.\u00a0This was intentional.\u00a0And it is wrong,\" Scott told reporters at a news conference. \"Our elected officials are\u00a0here to do the business of\u00a0their cities, their counties,\u00a0their states, and this nation.\u00a0Their families don't sign up\u00a0for this, to be harmed.\u00a0And it is wrong.\u00a0And everybody should be disgusted\u00a0about what happened this\u00a0morning.\" In an evening update, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott provided more details on the sequence of events in the attack on the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Scott said when officers arrived at the home they knocked on the front door and \"the door was opened by someone inside,\" though he didn't clarify who that person was. Officers then stood at the threshold and watched as Pelosi and another man struggled over control of a hammer. They shouted for both men to drop the weapon, but the intruder wrestled the weapon away and hit Pelosi in the head with it at least once, Scott said. At that point, the officers ran in and tackled the man. Law enforcement officials are providing another update on the hammer attack at the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which left her husband hospitalized. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott is addressing reporters at the department's headquarters. Local police are working with the FBI, the US attorney\u2019s office, US Capitol Police and the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office on the investigation. President Joe Biden described the attack on the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as \"despicable\" and directly tied the assault to growing strains of rightwing extremism. \"This is despicable. There\u2019s no place in America \u2014 there\u2019s too much violence, political violence. Too much hatred. Too much vitriol,\" Biden told a fundraising dinner Friday in Philadelphia. He said the chant the intruder reported used upon entering Pelosi's home \u2014 \"Where's Nancy?\" \u2014 was the same one used during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The President said it was implausible to cultivate conspiracies like a stolen election and Covid hoaxes without also fostering an environment of extreme violence. \"What makes us think that it's not going to corrode the political climate,\" he asked. \"Enough is enough is enough,\" Biden said. \"Every good person of good conscience needs to clearly and unambiguously stand up against the violence.\" He said he'd spoken to Speaker Pelosi earlier in the day, and helped arrange her travel back to San Francisco. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, called the attack on Paul Pelosi \"abhorrent\" and said all elected officials should publicly condemn the violence. \u201cEvery elected official, regardless of political party, should be outraged and publicly condemn what happened today in no uncertain terms,\u201d he said in a statement Friday night. He called on other members of Congress and elected officials around the country to put \"country over party and reject the conspiracy theories that are proving so divisive, despite any perceived political advantage.\" Thompson said the attack was a \"symptom of a much larger problem within our democracy\" and urged law enforcement and federal agencies to use their resources to protect other elected officials and the upcoming midterm elections. Police have talked to the man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi,\u00a0San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins told CNN on Friday. Jenkins declined to provide additional details, saying, \u201cgiven the investigation is still ongoing, none of that information is being released at this time.\u201d The suspect, David DePape, did sustain \"some minor injuries,\" she said, without providing any details. Officers took DePape into custody on suspicion of attempted\u00a0homicide, assault with a deadly\u00a0weapon, elder abuse and\u00a0several additional\u00a0felonies, according to SFPD Chief William Scott. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said Paul Pelosi called 911 while the alleged assailant was inside his home, helping the dispatcher expedite the police response early Friday morning. \"It is really thanks to Mr. Pelosi having the ability to be able to make that call, and truly the attention and the instincts of that dispatcher to realize that something was wrong in that situation and to make the police call a priority so they got there within two minutes to respond to this situation,\" she told CNN on Friday. Pelosi managed to keep the line open during the attack so that the dispatcher could hear a conversation in the background, according to a separate law enforcement source. Officers entered the couple\u2019s home around 2:27 a.m. local time (5:27 a.m. ET) to find Pelosi, 82, struggling over a hammer with another man, police said earlier Friday. The struggle was captured on police body camera as officers came through the door to intervene, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN's John Miller and Jamie Gangel contributed to this report House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now at the hospital in San Francisco to see her husband, according to a source familiar with the matter. Paul Pelosi underwent surgery for a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, according to a statement from Speaker Pelosi's spokesperson. He is expected to make a full recovery, it said. Two\u00a0blogs\u00a0written by\u00a0a user named \u201cdaviddepape\u201d \u2013 the same name as the suspect in the attack on\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband\u00a0\u2013\u00a0featured antisemitic screeds and QAnon-linked content in recent weeks, including videos that involved Pelosi. The content resembles posts from last year on\u00a0DePape\u2019s Facebook page, which was verified by two relatives. CNN was not able to confirm that the\u00a0blogs\u00a0were written by DePape. One of the\u00a0blogs, which has dozens of posts attributed to \u201cdaviddepape\u201d in recent weeks, posted several videos supporting the QAnon conspiracy theory. One of the videos includes a shot of Pelosi swinging a gavel during one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings, and another includes an image of Pelosi and other politicians.\u00a0 In another post, the account wrote \u201cAdrenachrome is real,\u201d referring to a substance that QAnon believers falsely claim is derived by torturing children. The post suggested \u201celites\u201d traffic in the substance.  In other posts, the author used antisemitic language, posted videos accusing LGBTQ people of \u201cgrooming\u201d children, and declared that \u201cany journalist saying\u201d there is no evidence of election fraud \u201cshould be dragged straight out into the street and shot.\u201d He most recently posted on Thursday, the day before the attack, linking a YouTube video that compared colleges to cults. On a second website, a Wordpress.com blog titled \u201cGod is loving,\u201d someone with the username \u201cdaviddepape\u201d wrote a string of posts over the course of several days in late August 2022. The author complained about censorship by tech companies and the media, posting numerous screenshots where text had been blacked out. The page has been taken offline. Former Vice President Mike Pence on Friday evening called the attack on Paul Pelosi \u201can outrage.\u201d\u00a0 Pence said in a\u00a0tweet, \u201cThis is an outrage and our hearts are with the entire Pelosi family. We pray Paul will make a full recovery. There can be no tolerance for violence against public officials or their families. This man should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d Read the tweet: It's been a little more than 12 hours since a brutal attack on the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who wasn't home when an intruder apparently came looking for her. Law enforcement officials and CNN sources have filled in some of the details surrounding the attack on Paul Pelosi, but other questions remain unanswered. What we know: Pelosi made a coded plea for help: Paul Pelosi called 911 when he encountered a threatening man in his home early Friday morning, according to a law enforcement source. He left the line open so a dispatcher could hear his conversation with the intruder, speaking surreptitiously but making it clear that he needed help.\nOfficers witnessed the attack: San Francisco police entered the couple's home around 2:27 a.m. local time (5:27 a.m. ET) to find Pelosi, 82, struggling over a hammer with another man, according to the city's police chief. Officers saw the intruder \"violently assault\" Pelosi with the hammer before they tackled him to the ground and arrested him.\nThe intruder seemed intent on finding the speaker: The person who attacked Paul Pelosi was searching for the Speaker of the House, according to a source briefed on the attack. He shouted \"Where is Nancy?\" at least twice and later, as he tried to tie up Paul Pelosi and said he would wait \"until Nancy got home,\" the source said. The speaker was in Washington, DC, at the time.\nPolice named their suspect: Officers took David DePape, 42, into custody on suspicion of attempted\u00a0homicide, assault with a deadly\u00a0weapon, elder abuse and\u00a0several additional\u00a0felonies, according to SFPD Chief William Scott.\nThe suspect's online activities: The suspect had posted memes and conspiracy theories on Facebook about Covid-19 vaccines, the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack. A former acquaintance, who knew him for eight years, told CNN she had received \u201creally disturbing\u201d emails from DePape in the past.\nPelosi is expected to recover: Pelosi underwent surgery for a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, according to a statement from Speaker Pelosi's office. He is expected to make a full recovery, it said. What we still don't know: What was the motive? Law enforcement officials say the motivation for the attack is still under investigation, declining so far to deem it an act of political violence. The suspect's online activities and reported remarks at the home could play a part in that determination.\nWhat security measures were in place? The security detail for lawmakers, including the speaker, does not protect their spouses when the members of Congress are not with them. Police said the intruder entered through a back door. It wasn't clear if he circumvented any security measures. Lawmakers have expressed\u00a0concerns over their safety\u00a0and that of their families. ##Catch Up## Vice President Kamala Harris said she talked with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Friday morning, after Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul,\u00a0was attacked with a hammer at the couple\u2019s home in San Francisco. Harris offered her prayers to the Pelosi family after what she called an \u201cact of extreme violence,\u201d and urged all leaders to think about their words and posture during a divisive time. \u201cI think we're looking at a time in our country where there is so much discourse that is fueled by hate and division and anyone who professes to be a leader and he has to really understand that the meaning and the impact of their words and their posture,\u201d she told reporters after a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. The vice president said she believes everyone needs to \"speak out against hate, speak out against violence,\" adding that it's still important to have \"public discourse when there are disagreements about policies.\" \u201cI pray for Paul's recovery. I know the Pelosis and this is tragic. Somebody literally broke into their whole home, saying \u2018Where's Nancy?\u2019\" she said. The man who is accused of assaulting Paul Pelosi was not known to US Capitol Police and was not in any federal databases tracking threats, according to three sources who were briefed on the investigation. According to his social media accounts, David DePape did post memes and conspiracy theories on Facebook about Covid-19 vaccines, the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack. He was booked Friday at San\u00a0Francisco County Jail on charges of attempted\u00a0homicide, assault with a deadly\u00a0weapon, elder abuse, verbal and\u00a0several other additional\u00a0felonies, according to San Francisco Police Chief William Scott and the sheriff's office's online\u00a0inmate locator. A reminder: These charges are just to book him into jail \u2014\u00a0they are not formal criminal charges by prosecutors. Paul Pelosi underwent surgery Friday \"to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,\" according to a statement released by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She thanked people for the \"outpouring of support and prayers\" following an attack on her husband in their San Francisco home. The statement, issued by spokesperson Drew Hammill, added:  \"The Pelosi family is immensely grateful to Mr. Pelosi\u2019s entire medical team and the law enforcement officers who responded to the assault.\"  Pelosi is expected to make a full recovery, it said. Paul Pelosi was able to call 911 at the start of the attack at his home in San Francisco, according to a law enforcement source and another source familiar with the matter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pelosi managed to keep the line open and the dispatcher could hear a conversation in the background, according to the law enforcement source. Pelosi was talking in code, that source said, providing enough detail so that the operator overhearing it could understand that something was wrong. At the same time Pelosi seemed to be trying not to make it obvious to the intruder that he had an open line, the source said. The dispatcher could hear Pelosi speaking about what was going on and dispatched police to check on the house, the source said. The struggle with Pelosi was captured on police body camera as officers came through the door to intervene, according to one of the sources.\u00a0 Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, addressing the attack on Paul Pelosi, said that \u201cthere\u2019s no room for violence anywhere,\u201d but then added that voters would send House Speaker Nancy Pelosi home \u201cto be with him in California.\u201d While stumping for GOP House candidate Yesli Vega in Virginia\u2019s 7th District, Youngkin, also a Republican, told the crowd: \u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s husband had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There's no room for violence anywhere, but we're gonna\u2019 send her back to be with him in California. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go do.\u201d The comments came hours after Pelosi was attacked with a hammer at the couple\u2019s home in San Francisco early Friday morning, law enforcement sources told CNN. The assailant was searching for the speaker of the House, according to a source briefed on the attack. Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter responded to CNN\u2019s request for additional comment with the following statement:  \u201cAs the governor clearly said, the assault on Paul Pelosi was wrong and there is no place for violence. He wishes him a full recovery and is keeping the Pelosi family in his prayers.\u201d CNN's Eric Bradner contributed to this report Speaker Nancy Pelosi was able to speak to her husband after the attack and before he was taken into surgery, according to a source familiar with the matter.\u00a0\u00a0 She is flying back to San Francisco with her family to be with her husband, a source said. Paul Pelosi was having surgery for injuries to his head, the source said but did not offer more details on the treatment. He is expected to make a full recovery, the Democratic speaker\u2019s office\u00a0said in a statement. He was attacked by a man with a hammer at the couple\u2019s home in San Francisco early Friday morning, law enforcement sources told CNN.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement on the hammer attack at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's residence on Friday. \"This heinous assault is yet another example of the dangerous consequences of the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is putting lives at risk and undermining our very democracy and Democratic institutions,\" Newsom wrote. \"Those who are using their platforms to incite\u00a0violence must be held to account.\" Newsom did not name anyone specific in denouncing hateful rhetoric. Police have not shared a suspected motive for the brutal attack, but the intruder shouted \u201cWhere is Nancy?\u201d before hitting Paul Pelosi with a hammer, according to a source briefed on the attack. \"Our leaders should never fear for their safety and the safety of their families in serving the people they were elected to represent \u2013 not in their homes, not at the U.S. Capitol, not anywhere,\" the governor added. California Rep. Karen Bass expressed concern for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband after he was attacked in the couple's residence, saying it illustrates \"the danger that our democracy is in.\"   \u201cI hear that he should recover, but the idea that he was violently attacked with a hammer is just frightening \u2013 the level of political discourse\u00a0that our country is in right now, and it reminds me of Jan. 6 because when the insurrectionists broke in the Capitol, one of the first places they went was to the speaker\u2019s office and they made clear that they were after her when they assaulted the Capitol,\" she said in an interview with CNN's Josh Campbell. One Jan. 6 rioter was sentenced in August to seven years in prison for carrying a gun to the Capitol and threats to Pelosi.  \"It just shows us the danger that our democracy is in and it also makes me angry thinking of my Republican colleagues who attempt to minimize what happened Jan. 6 and who ignored the hate speech, the violent speech that is going on right now,\" Bass said.  She also echoed other lawmakers' concerns over the safety of themselves and their families.  \u201cIt\u2019s something you pay attention to, you watch your security, you have to be concerned. I certainly am concerned about my security, and I\u2019m concerned for others, my colleagues that are in Congress, and frankly other people in elected office right now. It just shows you what a delicate position our democracy is in,\u201d Bass said.  She laid the blame at the feet of former President Donald Trump.  \u201cI think that we all thought on Election Day when Trump was defeated that the Trump era was over. Clearly, it is not over, and I put all of this at his doorstep because he is the one who sent our country in this direction,\" she said.  Bass\u2019 Los Angeles home was\u00a0burgled\u00a0in September. An increase in threats to US lawmakers over the last two years has also extended to their family members, according to federal law enforcement officials, and a lack of federal protection for family members has frustrated some members of Congress. The security detail for lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, does not protect their family members, including spouses, when the members of Congress are not with them, according to multiple sources. Some lawmakers have received additional security in their home districts from local police departments and private contractors.\u00a0 After the attack on Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul Pelosi, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN that the threats against his own family included one that mentioned killing his young child. But when he asked US Capitol Police for additional security, they essentially told him to \u201cget in line,\u201d Kinzinger said.\u00a0 Like other lawmakers, Kinzinger\u2019s security detail does not protect his family when he is not with them, and the lack of assistance provided by Capitol Police has meant his campaign would have to foot the bill for any additional security.  \u201cThat usually ended up being private security,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Calls for violence against lawmakers online and elsewhere have referenced both elected officials and their families, according to sources familiar with the threat environment who told CNN that law enforcement agencies have been grappling with how to address those threats in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\u00a0 In the months following the Jan. 6 insurrection, Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies worked to increase protection for members of Congress when they are in Washington, DC, and traveling back to their home districts.\u00a0 Capitol Police declined to comment when asked Friday about security for the families of lawmakers.\u00a0 A senior aide on Capitol Hill tells CNN that Capitol Police are now assessing additional security options for the protection of families of congressional leadership. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after Jan. 6, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks. According to the most recent statistics, Capitol Police tracked\u00a0roughly 9,600 threats in 2021 against the people and places the department is charged with protecting. It\u2019s unclear how many threats were made against family members. Several lawmakers have sought additional protection from US Capitol Police after receiving threats to their families, but the agency largely lacks the resources and training to fill those requests, according to one source familiar with the matter. Two former acquaintances of David DePape, the suspect in Paul Pelosi's attack, told CNN he exhibited concerning behavior over the years.\u00a0 Linda Schneider said she got to know DePape roughly eight years ago and that he occasionally housesat for her in California. When they met, she said, DePape was living in a storage unit in the Berkeley area and told her he had been struggling with hard drugs but was \u201ctrying to create a new life for himself.\u201d Schneider later received \u201creally disturbing\u201d emails from DePape in which he sounded like a \u201cmegalomaniac and so out of touch with reality,\u201d she said. She said she stopped communicating with him \u201cbecause it seemed so dangerous,\u201d adding that she recalled him \u201cusing Biblical justification to do harm.\u201d\u00a0 Laura Hayes, who also lives in California, said she worked with DePape for a few months about a decade ago making hemp bracelets when he was living in a storage shed in the Berkeley area. She said DePape sold the bracelets as a business. \u201cHe was very odd. He didn\u2019t make eye contact very well,\u201d Hayes said.  She recalled him saying that \u201che talks to angels and there will be a hard time coming.\u201d But she didn\u2019t remember any seriously threatening comments, and said she didn\u2019t think much of it because \u201cit\u2019s Berkeley,\u201d a place where eccentric characters aren\u2019t uncommon.\u00a0\u00a0 The man who allegedly attacked Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband early Friday posted memes and conspiracy theories on Facebook about Covid-19 vaccines, the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack. David DePape, 42,\u00a0was identified by police Friday as the suspect in the assault on Paul Pelosi at the speaker\u2019s San Francisco home.\u00a0 Two of DePape\u2019s relatives told CNN that DePape is estranged from his family, and confirmed that the Facebook account \u2013 which was taken down by the social media company on Friday \u2013 belonged to him.\u00a0 His stepfather, Gene DePape, said David DePape grew up in Powell River, British Columbia, and left Canada about 20 years ago to pursue a relationship that brought him to California.\u00a0 \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d the suspect\u2019s uncle, Mark DePape, said of his nephew\u2019s alleged attack on Pelosi. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a scam. I don\u2019t want to hear something like that.\u201d Last year, David DePape posted links on his Facebook page to multiple videos produced by My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell falsely alleging that the 2020 election was stolen. Other posts included transphobic images and linked to websites claiming Covid-19 vaccines were deadly. \u201cThe death rates being promoted are what ever \u2018THEY\u2019 want to be promoted as the death rate,\u201d one post read.\u00a0 DePape also posted links to YouTube videos with titles like \u201cDemocrat FARCE Commission to Investigate January 6th Capitol Riot COLLAPSES in Congress!!!\u201d and \u201cGlobal Elites Plan To Take Control Of YOUR Money! (Revealed)\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Two days after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of killing George Floyd, DePape wrote that the trial was \u201ca modern lynching,\u201d falsely indicating that Floyd died of a drug overdose.\u00a0 He also posted content about\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cGreat Reset\u201d \u2013 the sprawling conspiracy theory that global elites are using coronavirus to usher in a new world order in which they gain more power and oppress the masses. And he complained that politicians making promises to try to win votes \u201care offering you bribes in exchange for your further enslavement.\u201d Most of the public posts on DePape\u2019s Facebook page were from 2021. In earlier years, DePape also posted long screeds about religion, including claims that \u201cJesus is the anti christ.\u201d None of the public posts appeared to mention Pelosi.\u00a0 Paul Pelosi was taken into surgery this morning, according two sources familiar with the situation.  His doctors have told the family that he will recover, the sources said. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said the motive for the attack on Paul Pelosi is still being determined. The suspect has been identified and \"will be booked at San\u00a0Francisco county jail on the\u00a0following charges: attempted\u00a0homicide, assault with a deadly\u00a0weapon, elder abuse, verbal and\u00a0several other additional\u00a0felonies,\" he said.\u00a0 Police are working with the FBI, US attorney's office, Capitol Police and the San Francisco district attorney's office on the investigation, he added. San Francisco police witnessed Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and an intruder struggling over a hammer before he was attacked Friday, officials said. Responding to an emergency call at the couple's home around 2:27 a.m. local time (5:27 a.m. ET), officers saw the attacker and Pelosi both holding the hammer when they entered the room, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said in a news conference. \"The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and\u00a0violently assaulted him with it,\" Scott said.\u00a0\"Our officers immediately tackled\u00a0the suspect, disarmed him, took\u00a0him into custody, requested\u00a0emergency backup and rendered\u00a0medical aid.\" Both men were taken to a hospital, Scott said. He did not provide further details on their injuries. The chief praised the officers who took down the intruder and an emergency dispatcher who sent them to the Pelosis' home. Law enforcement officials are holding a news conference about the attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The San Francisco Police Department, the US Capitol Police and the FBI are all involved in the investigation. The man who assaulted Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, tried to tie him up \u201cuntil Nancy got home,\u201d according to two sources familiar with the situation.\u00a0 When the police arrived at the residence, the attacker said he was \u201cwaiting for Nancy.\u201d San Francisco Mayor London Breed says she's in touch with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and thanked local law enforcement for their work investigating the attack on the speaker's husband. \"This was a horrific and scary incident. I have reached out to Speaker Pelosi to offer my support to her and her family. I want to thank the San Francisco Police Department and the San Francisco Fire Department for their quick response to this incident,\" Breed said in a statement. \"The Police have the suspect in custody, and as we have more information to share, we will do so.\" House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy reached out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the attack on her husband and said he is praying for a full recovery, according to McCarthy\u2019s office.\u00a0 \u201cLeader McCarthy reached out to the speaker to check in on Paul and said he's praying for a full recovery and is thankful they caught the assailant,\u201d said Mark Bednar, a spokesperson for McCarthy.\u00a0 GOP Rep. Liz Cheney also\u00a0tweeted: \u201cReports about the brutal attack on Paul Pelosi are horrific and deeply troubling. My family and I are praying for his recovery.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris expressed concern about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband. \u201cDoug and I are appalled by the attack on Paul Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi\u2019s husband,\" Harris said in a tweet. \"The entire Pelosi family is in our hearts and we wish him a speedy recovery.\" Harris and Pelosi each rose through the ranks of California politics before holding their positions in the federal government. The person who attacked Paul Pelosi was searching for the speaker of the House, according to a source briefed on the attack. The source told CNN the intruder confronted the speaker\u2019s husband in their San Francisco home shouting: \u201cWhere is Nancy? Where is Nancy?\" Police have arrested a man suspected of carrying out the attack and his potential motive is under investigation, according to the speaker's office. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said in a tweet on Friday he is \u201chorrified and disgusted\u201d by the reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul Pelosi was assaulted in his home.\u00a0 \u201cGrateful to hear that Paul is on track to make a full recovery and that law enforcement including our stellar Capitol Police are on the case,\u201d he added in the tweet. \u00a0 President Biden spoke with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Friday after a man broke into her home and attacked her husband, the White House said. \u201cThe President is praying for Paul Pelosi and for Speaker Pelosi\u2019s whole family. This morning he called Speaker Pelosi to express his support after this horrible attack,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. She continued: \u201cHe is also very glad that a full recovery is expected. The President continues to condemn all violence, and asks that the family\u2019s desire for privacy be respected.\u201d The Pelosis have been married since 1963 and have five children. Paul Pelosi, the husband of\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked by a man with a hammer at the couple\u2019s home in San Francisco early Friday morning, law enforcement sources tell CNN. Pelosi, 82, was hospitalized but is expected to make a full recovery, the Democratic speaker\u2019s office\u00a0said in a statement. Police arrested a suspect and his potential motive is under investigation. The assailant entered the Pelosi residence through the back of the house, according two sources familiar with the early details of the incident, but little more is known about how the attack played out.  With Speaker Pelosi away, there would not have been a security detail at the residence, according to one source familiar with protocol. Special agents with the US Capitol Police\u2019s California Field Office \u201cquickly arrived on scene, while a team of investigators from the Department\u2019s Threat Assessment Section was simultaneously dispatched from the East Coast to assist the FBI and the San Francisco Police with a joint investigation,\u201d according to a statement."

  "date": "2022-10-16T01:25:09Z",
  "text": "Documents provided to the House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection by the US Secret Service show that the agency and its law enforcement partners were aware of social media posts that contained violent language and threats aimed at lawmakers prior to the US Capitol attack.  The documents, obtained exclusively by CNN, were handed over to the committee ahead of Thursday's hearing, and shed new light on discussions between law enforcement agencies ahead of the attack.  The documents also show the Secret Service took into account assessments from partner agencies, including the FBI and US Capitol Police, as they determined their security posture ahead of the January 6 vote certification. Despite the violent online rhetoric shared in these documents, none of the agencies gave a clear warning about the potential for large scale violence like what unfolded at the Capitol building that day, in spite of information they were sharing. \"No immediate threats being tracked at this time,\" one summary of the FBI intelligence assessment related to January 6 that was shared with  the Secret Service read.  However, the Secret Service was alerted to social media posts from sites such as Parler, which was then a popular far-right platform.  \"Will fight for Trump no matter what,\" one post flagged to the Secret Service read.  \"When we say taking the power away from corruption we meant it,\" said another.  The documents do not address other concerns raised by the committee this week, including inconsistent testimony from Secret Service witnesses, who told the panel \"they had received no intelligence about violence that could have potentially threatened any of their protectees on January 6th, including the vice president.\"  \"Evidence strongly suggests that this testimony is not credible,\" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California said during Thursday's hearing.   Following the hearing, Schiff said in an interview with CNN that the committee intends \"to bring people back in from the Secret Service, some who may have testified in ways that we don't find credible now that we have obtained this documentary evidence, but other witnesses potentially that we have not heard from as well.\"  In a statement to CNN, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the service \"engaged in robust intelligence sharing\" with its law enforcement partners \"before and during January 6th.\"  \"Intelligence was received from and sent to multiple federal state and local agencies. Included are the redacted examples of these communications that were referenced in Thursday's committee hearing and show the multi-agency communication,\" he said.   \"Though the Secret Service's specific mission was executed without compromise, the unprecedented events of that day continue to be evaluated to ensure an attack on our democracy can never occur again,\" Guglielmi said. \"This is not only paramount to our institutions of government but speaks to the very existence and purpose of the United States Secret Service.\"   Guglielmi also told CNN that the Secret Service \"never received a communication from the committee about an employee's testimony being contradicted.\" The House Select Committee declined to comment when asked about the documents.  Thursday's hearing was the first since July 21. In the nearly three months since that hearing, the committee obtained more than 1 million records from the Secret Service. The panel revealed some of what they learned during Thursday's hearing.  While there are still questions surrounding erased text messages from Secret Service agents around the insurrection, the panel obtained messages and emails showing the agency receiving warnings before January 6, 2021, about the prospect of violence, as well as real-time reports of weapons in the crowd ahead of Trump's speech at the Ellipse.   Schiff said during Thursday's hearing that the Secret Service had received alerts of online threats made against then-Vice President Mike Pence ahead of the Capitol insurrection, including that Pence would be \"'a dead man walking if he doesn't do the right thing.'\"   On January 6, one Secret Service agent texted at 12:36 p.m., according to the committee, \"With so many weapons found so far; you wonder how many are unknown. Could be sporty after dark.\"  Another agent responded minutes later, \"No doubt. The people at the Ellipse said they are moving to the Capitol after the POTUS speech.\""

  "title": "Jan. 6 committee votes to subpoena Trump",
  "date": "2022-10-14T15:20:59.807Z",
  "text": "The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection held its 10th public hearing, unveiling new evidence and video that showed how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack at the US Capitol.  During the hearing, the panel also voted unanimously to subpoena Trump. It\u2019s rare but not without precedent for Congress to subpoena sitting and former presidents for testimony. \"The\u00a0need for this committee to hear\u00a0from Donald Trump goes beyond\u00a0our fact-finding.\u00a0This is a question about\u00a0accountability to the American\u00a0people.\u00a0He must be accountable.\u00a0He is required to answer for his\u00a0actions,\" Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said. Additionally, in the roughly three months since the last hearing, the panel has obtained more than 1 million records from the Secret Service. These messages revealed agents spotted numerous guns in the crowd\u00a0the morning of Jan. 6 before Trump was set to speak at the Ellipse. Agents were also aware of the involvement of right-wing groups. Here are some other key takeaways: Never-before-seen video: The committee played previously unseen footage from Fort McNair, the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection and scrambled to respond to the unfolding crisis.\u00a0The footage shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top officials working the phones and coordinating with Trump Cabinet members and other officials to secure the resources needed to quell the insurrection and secure the Capitol.\nViolent online rhetoric: Days before the attack, Trump\u2019s communication adviser, Jason Miller, boasted to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that he \u201cgot the base FIRED UP,\u201d and shared a link to a pro-Trump webpage containing hundreds of threatening comments about killing lawmakers. \u201cOur \u2018lawmakers\u2019 in Congress can leave one of two ways: 1. in a body bag 2. After rightfully certifying Trump the winner,\u201d one post on the webpage said. \ufffd\ufffdGallows don\u2019t require electricity,\u201d another post read. The committee said the Secret Service was also monitoring this kind of online activity.\nThreats against Pence: The Secret Service received alerts of online threats made against then-Vice President Mike Pence ahead of the Capitol insurrection, including that Pence would be \"'a dead man walking if he doesn't do the right thing,\u2019\u201d according to committee member Rep. Adam Schiff. On the day of the attack, Pence ultimately rejected pleas from Trump and his top allies to halt certification of Joe Biden's victory\nPremeditated plan to declare victory: Deposition video and a memo obtained from the National Archives showed how former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s Counsel, Greg Jacob, and Pence\u2019s then-chief of staff Marc Short prepared for Trump to declare victory on Election Night, regardless of the results. \u201cWe also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election, even if he lost,\u201d committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.\nTrump knew he lost \u2014 but tried to change results anyway: Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election. Hutchinson\u2019s testimony had been some of the most damning against Trump during the summer hearings, as she provided detailed accounts about Trump\u2019s actions on Jan. 6. On Thursday, the committee showed a new video deposition from Hutchinson where she spoke to Meadows about Trump\u2019s January 2021 call where he urged the Georgia secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win. Hutchinson also said that she witnessed a conversation between Meadows and Trump where he was furious the Supreme Court had rejected a lawsuit seeking to overturn the election result. ##Catch Up## Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on Jan. 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election.\u00a0 The Jan. 6 select committee aired snippets of the footage at its public hearing on Thursday, but CNN has obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn't presented by the panel.\u00a0 Congressional leaders contemplated, far more seriously than previously known, whether to reconvene the Electoral College proceedings at Fort McNair, the footage obtained by CNN reveals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the \"backup plan,\" and officials tried to figure out how they'd transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\u202f The extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President\u202fDonald Trump's inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get -- from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments -- to defeat the mob he incited. The footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the Jan. 6 House select committee investigating the insurrection. In one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\u00a0 \"I'd like to know a good God damn reason why it's been denied,\" Schumer said. \"Please \u2014 the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We've all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.\"\u00a0 McCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\u00a0\u00a0 And in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen talking to the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should \"make arrests, starting now,\" but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response. Keep reading. The House Jan. 6 committee took the extraordinary and theatrical step of\u00a0voting to subpoena former President Donald Trump\u00a0on Thursday. A coda to its public hearings, the\u00a0subpoena\u00a0might not lead to Trump\u2019s testimony and handing over of documents, but it will act as a teaser for what\u2019s to come. The committee still has a report to publish and could also request that the Justice Department pursue charges against Trump or his former aides for their roles in helping to incite the attack on the Capitol and their efforts to overturn the 2020 election. What happens now? Trump could decide to comply. The committee would then negotiate a time, place and method. That would take time. If he\u00a0refuses to comply with the subpoena, here\u2019s what could happen: Contempt.\u00a0The full House, which is controlled by Democrats until at least January, could vote to hold him in contempt of Congress, something it\u2019s done with several other uncooperative witnesses.\nReferral.\u00a0After a contempt of Congress referral, the Justice Department could then prosecute, as it did with Trump\u2019s former aide\u00a0Steve Bannon\u00a0and plans to do with his once economic adviser Peter Navarro.\nProsecution.\u00a0If found guilty, as Bannon was, Trump could theoretically face a minimum of\u00a030 days in jail. Bannon will be sentenced for failing to comply with the House subpoena later this month. This sequence of events seems far-fetched for Trump. \u201cNone of that is going to happen,\u201d the Trump critic and conservative lawyer George Conway predicted during an appearance on CNN on Thursday. \u201cThis is about laying a marker. This is about triggering a response [from Trump].\u201d Trump\u00a0responded on social media, calling the committee a \u201cBUST\u201d and a \u201claughing stock\u201d and accusing members of dividing the country. Conway did point out the Supreme Court has already made clear where it stands on Trump\u2019s status as a former president when it\u00a0ignored his attempt\u00a0to block the National Archives from sharing information with the committee. The court, notably, also\u00a0declined on Thursday to intervene\u00a0on Trump\u2019s behalf in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents inquiry. But the Justice Department, rather than go after Trump for ignoring a congressional subpoena, if it comes to that, has arguably larger and more important inquiries that involve his treatment of classified documents after he left the White House and his effort to overturn the election as president. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming said the Jan. 6 committee feels it has enough information to make referrals to the Department of Justice for prosecutions stemming from the committee\u2019s work. And she noted that more than 30 witnesses have invoked Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination with regard to their dealings with the former\u00a0President. While Thursday's hearing will be the Jan. 6 committee's last one before the midterm elections, the panel\u2019s work is not yet complete, and aides have cautioned against the hearing being the panel\u2019s final word, noting that the investigation is still ongoing. The committee just recently interviewed Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and the panel last month subpoenaed Wisconsin GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for testimony, which Vos sued to stop. The select committee\u2019s investigation has also been working toward a final report, though it\u2019s still not clear what shape that will take or when it might be released. Sources say the panel has also not yet made any decision on whether to make any criminal referrals to the Department of Justice. But regardless of the status of the investigation, the committee has an external deadline less than three months away: The end of the 117th Congress on Jan. 3, 2023, when Republicans are favored to take control of the House in the midterms. Should former President Donald Trump object to the committee's subpoena, it could lead to a lengthy court fight that outlives the committee. ##Investigation## One person whose testimony was noticeably absent from the House select committee's hearing on Thursday was Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Committee members interviewed Thomas last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the last hearing before the midterm election. Despite saying for months that they wanted to hear from Thomas, members downplayed the significance of her testimony following her interview, and it was clear ahead of Thursday that she was not expected to be a central part of the hearing that was instead solely focused on former President Donald Trump. But her absence was notable considering the panel did use testimony from several other high-profile witnesses who had been interviewed since the committee\u2019s most recent hearing earlier this summer. Some context: Members of the panel have long said they are interested in speaking with Thomas, particularly after CNN first reported\u00a0text messages she exchanged with then-Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The texts show Thomas urging Meadows to continue the fight to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. The committee also has email correspondence between Thomas and Trump\u2019s election attorney John Eastman. Asked if the Jan. 6 committee is prepared to go to court if former President Donald Trump fails to comply with the subpoena, the panel's chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said, \u201cLet\u2019s just see what happens.\u201d \u201cWe hope with this subpoenaing of Donald Trump, and his agreeing to it, it closes the chapter on a lot of the evidence we've shared. And so if we get his attention, fine, if not, we'll go with the evidence that we've collected,\u201d Thompson said.  \u201cHe\u2019s a former President, we hope that he honors it,\u201d he added. Thompson also said the subpoena of the former President would allow him to \u201cclear the record\u201d of his own culpability in the events that led to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.  \u201cWhat we presented today clearly shows the President\u2019s culpability in what occurred on Jan. 6. So if he wants to clear the record, he will have an opportunity to do it,\u201d Thompson said.\u00a0 When pressed by CNN\u2019s Sara Murray on why Trump would comply with the subpoena when he\u2019s already under criminal investigation and knows the work of the Jan. 6 committee will end, Thompson said, \u201cWell, ask Donald Trump.\u201d Asked whether there are concerns about getting the work done before the new Congress, he said: \u201cwell we\u2019ll do our work until we sunset.\" Rep. Bennie Thompson, chair of the Jan. 6 committee, told CNN that the panel is not planning to subpoena former Vice President Mike Pence, after they voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon. The Democrat from Mississippi answered \"no\" when asked by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju whether it was in the committee's plans.  Thompson also told CNN that the committee\u2019s previous interest in hearing from Pence has waned, saying \u201cwe have collected enough evidence\" that Pence \"did his job.\" \"We now need to hear from the President,\" he added.  Former President Donald Trump is blasting the Jan. 6 committee\u2019s unanimous vote to subpoena him for documents and testimony. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Unselect Committee ask me to testify months ago?\" he wrote on his\u00a0Truth Social social media platform, using a derisive moniker for the House select committee on the Jan. 6 attack. \"Why did they wait until the very end, the final moments of their last meeting? Because the Committee is a total 'BUST' that has only served to further divide our Country which, by the way, is doing very badly - A laughing stock all over the World?\u201d Trump\u00a0has prevented many of his aides from sharing with the committee, urging them to invoke privilege. More context: The vote took place at the end of today's Jan. 6 hearing, as the panel made its case that Trump lied about the outcome of the 2020 election and spurred on a violent mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol. It\u2019s rare but not without precedent for Congress to subpoena sitting and former presidents for testimony. The action is expected to trigger a prolonged court battle over Trump\u2019s possible compliance, which could even outlast the committee itself. Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the need to hear from Trump \"goes beyond\u00a0our fact-finding,\" framing it as a question of\u00a0\"accountability to the American\u00a0people.\" Trump has previously derided the panel as an \u201cUnselect Committee of Political Thugs and Hacks\u201d and said its members are \u201cevil, sinister and unpatriotic.\u201d CNN's Manu Raju, Jamie Gangel, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed reporting to this post.\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the Jan. 6 committee, told CNN the reason the panel felt it needed to subpoena former President Donald Trump is because it has been unable to nail down his specific actions and conversations.  Raskin added that witnesses closest to Trump, who could provided specifics, have pled the Fifth when interviewed by the committee. \u201cWe actually were able to nail down every salient detail in pretty much every element of the offense, except for a number of things relating directly to what Donald Trump was doing and what he was saying. Obviously, we got some of that, but we didn't get all of it. And so one way of addressing the 30 or so witnesses who took the Fifth when it came to Donald Trump's own actions, is to call Donald Trump in himself\u201d Raskin said. Raskin pushed back on the notion that this subpoena would merely be a symbolic act that gets tied up in court.  \u201cI want to believe that every American citizen who knows something about these events would come forward to testify and nobody knows more about them than Donald Trump,\" he said.  But when pressed again on how the committee will handle Trump\u2019s efforts to likely block this subpoena, Raskin said, \u201cwe haven't discussed that because you're several hypothetical steps down the road from us. But I'll say this, we certainly have litigated in the past, and I think we've got a pretty unbroken track record of winning our cases precisely because all we're asking people to do is to come forward and testify. And the Supreme Court has been perfectly clear that Congress has the power to do that.\u201d CNN has obtained previously unseen footage from Jan. 6, showing congressional leaders while they took refuge at Fort McNair, two miles from the US Capitol. The exclusive footage will air on CNN on Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET, during a special edition of \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0.\u201d The footage shows congressional leaders, after evacuating from the Capitol, gathering at Fort McNair working the phones, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help as they frantically scrambled to quell the insurrection. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack aired snippets of this material at its hearing Thursday. CNN has obtained additional clips that weren\u2019t shown by the committee. CNN's Anderson Cooper said he saw the entirety of the more than 40-minute long footage that was provided to the committee.  \"When I saw this video, it's\u00a0obviously extraordinary.\u00a0You see members of Congress,\u00a0Republicans and Democrats at\u00a0Fort McNair, huddled together,\u00a0trying to figure out what they\u00a0can do to keep these\u00a0proceedings going.\u00a0We see much more than we ever\u00a0knew before about their\u00a0attempts, their discussions\u00a0about moving the entire\u00a0Congress to a location to\u00a0actually continue the vote and then\u00a0deciding, 'No,' it has to take\u00a0place at Capitol Hill,\" Cooper explained.  The House Jan. 6 committee voted Thursday to\u00a0subpoena\u00a0former President Donald Trump for documents and testimony at the conclusion of the panel\u2019s final hearing before the midterm elections. The unanimous vote marks an escalation in the committee\u2019s efforts to obtain testimony from the former President, though at this late stage, it\u2019s unlikely that Trump would comply with the subpoena \u2013 and the committee likely doesn\u2019t have time for a lengthy court fight.\u00a0 It\u2019s rare but not without precedent for Congress to subpoena sitting and former presidents for testimony. House Select Committee Char Bennie Thompson and Vice Chair Liz Cheney argued the committee needed to hear from Trump to tell the most complete story it can about the Jan. 6 riot.  \u201cThanks to the tireless work of our members and investigators, we have left no doubt \u2014 none \u2013 that Donald Trump led an effort to upend American democracy that directly resulted in the violence of Jan. 6,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe is the one person at the center of the story of what happened on Jan. 6. So we want to hear from him,\u201d Thompson said. Cheney said more than 30 witnesses have invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, including some who communicated with Trump. She noted that others, like Steve Bannon, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify \u2013 and Bannon was convicted after the Justice Department indicted him \u2013 but argued the committee couldn\u2019t wait for the Justice Department to obtain information from those recalcitrant witnesses.\u00a0 \u201cAt some point, the Department of Justice may well unearth the facts that these and other witnesses are currently concealing,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cBut our duty today is to our country and our children and our Constitution. We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion. And every American is entitled to the answers, so we can act now to protect our republic,\u201d she said. Jan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel's decision to vote to subpoena former President Donald Trump is important for the American people. \"The\u00a0need for this committee to hear\u00a0from Donald Trump goes beyond\u00a0our fact-finding.\u00a0This is a question about\u00a0accountability to the American\u00a0people.\u00a0He must be accountable.\u00a0He is required to answer for his\u00a0actions,\" he said during the committee's hearing on Thursday. Thompson said the committee has a \"obligation\" to see Trump's testimony, though it recognizes that the subpoena of a former President is a \"serious and extraordinary action.\" \"That's why we want to take this\u00a0step in full view of the\u00a0American people,\" he added. \"There's precedent in American\u00a0history to congress to compel\u00a0the testimony of a President.\u00a0There is also precedent for\u00a0presidents to provide testimony\u00a0and documentary evidence to\u00a0congressional investigators,\" Thompson said. ##Investigation## Elaine Chao, who resigned from her post as former President Donald Trump's Secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack when she testified to the committee.\u00a0 \"I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking and it was something that, as I mentioned in my statement, that I could not put aside,\" said Chao, one of the former members of Trump's Cabinet whose recorded testimony lawmakers aired on Thursday.\u00a0 \"And at a particular point, the events were such that it was impossible for me to continue, given my personal values and my philosophy. I came as an immigrant to this country. I believe in this country. I believe in the peaceful transfer of power. I believe in democracy. And so I was \u2014 it was a decision that I made on my own,\" she said.\u00a0 CNN reported in August that Chao, who is also the wife of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, had met with the committee. But after condemning the attack in her resignation letter in early 2021, Chao had largely stayed out of the national spotlight, with her recent comments to the committee providing fresh insight into her thinking on the deadly attack.\u00a0 Chao's resignation came the same day that Betsy DeVos, who served as Trump's Education secretary, also resigned from her post, calling the riot \"unconscionable for our country.\"\u00a0 ##Testimony## The Jan. 6 select committee aired previously unseen footage from Fort McNair, the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection and scrambled to respond to the unfolding crisis.\u00a0 Committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said during the hearing that the footage shows how Trump administration officials and congressional leaders worked around then-President Donald Trump to put down the riot that he had incited. The footage shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top officials working the phones and coordinating with Trump Cabinet members and other officials to secure the resources needed to quell the insurrection and secure the Capitol. The footage also showed two phone calls between Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role on January 6, coordinating the emergency response. The new footage showed Schumer dressing down then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. During their heated phone call, Schumer implored Rosen to intervene directly with Trump, and tell Trump to call off the mob. During the call, Pelosi told Rosen that the pro-Trump rioters were \u201cbreaking the law\u2026 at the instigation of the President of the United States.\u201d \u201cThe concern that we have for personal safety transcends everything,\u201d Pelosi told Rosen. Pelosi is seen on the phone with then-Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, discussing getting the state\u2019s National Guard dispatched to the Capitol. During the hearing, the panel labeled the footage as showing lawmakers at an \u201cundisclosed location.\u201d It has been public knowledge since January 6, 2021, that senior congressional leaders from both parties took refuge at Fort McNair, an Army base in DC, while the Capitol was overrun. Coverage note: CNN has obtained additional footage from Fort McNair that wasn\u2019t shown by the committee.\u00a0 The exclusive footage will air on CNN on Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET, during a special edition of \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0.\u201d The footage shows congressional leaders, after evacuating from the Capitol, gathering at Fort McNair working the phones, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help as they frantically scrambled to quell the insurrection. Watch the new footage of congressional leaders taking refuge on Jan. 6: ##Investigation## The House Select Committee is reviewing a potential attempt to obstruct testimony surrounding claims that former President Donald Trump got in a heated exchange with his Secret Service detail on the day of the riot, a member of the panel says. \u201cThe committee is reviewing testimony regarding potential obstruction on this issue, including testimony about advice given not to tell the committee about this specific topic,\u201d Rep. Pete Aguilar, a Democrat from California, said at the panel\u2019s hearing Thursday. \u201cWe will address this matter in our report.\u201d Aguilar said a former White House employee with national security responsibilities was informed of Trump\u2019s \u201cirate behavior\u201d in the limo from then-White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato in Ornato\u2019s office. \u201cIt was Mr. Engel with Mr. Ornato in that office. They'd expressed to me that the President was irate, you know, on the drive up,\u201d said the former White House employee, according to Aguilar. Secret Service lead agent Robert Engel \u201cdid not deny the fact that the President was irate,\u201d added Aguilar. Aguilar said the testimony \u201ccorresponds closely\u201d with former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s previous testimony. Remember: This summer, Hutchinson\u00a0testified\u00a0that she heard from Ornato that Trump was\u00a0so enraged at his Secret Service detail\u00a0for blocking him from going to the Capitol that \u201che reached up toward the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel\u201d and \u201cthen used his free hand to lunge toward\u201d Engel. Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her the story in front of Engel and he did not dispute the account.\u00a0 After that hearing, a\u00a0Secret Service official\u00a0familiar with the matter told CNN that Ornato denied telling Hutchinson that the former President grabbed the steering wheel or an agent on his detail. Hutchinson stood by her testimony. ##Investigation## A national security official who worked in the White House told the House select committee that former President Donald Trump\u2019s angry outburst in the presidential SUV on Jan. 6, 2021 was so widely known that it became \u201cwater cooler talk,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, said Thursday. The account of the official, whose identity was not revealed by the Jan. 6 committee, further corroborates earlier testimony from former Mark Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson about Trump angrily reacting to being told by his Secret Service agents he could not go to the\u00a0US\u00a0Capitol after his speech on Jan. 6. \u201cIn the days following that, I do remember, you know, again, hearing again how angry the President was when, you know, they were in the limo,\u201d the official said, according to Aguilar. \u201cBut beyond specifics of that, that\u2019s pretty much the extent of the cooler talk.\u201d More on the incident: Hutchinson testified\u00a0in a June hearing\u00a0that Tony Ornato told her Trump became \"irate\" when informed by security that he would not be going to the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, because the situation was not secure.  Ornato said that Trump was\u00a0so enraged at his Secret Service detail\u00a0for blocking him from going to the Capitol that \u201che reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel\u201d and \u201cthen used his free hand to lunge towards\u201d Secret Service agent Robert Engel. Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her the story in front of Engel and he did not dispute the account.\u00a0 Trump and his Republican allies have contested Hutchinson\u2019s account as they\u2019ve sought to undermine her testimony against Trump. ##Investigation## The select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection sought to illustrate then-President Trump\u2019s inaction as rioters stormed the Capitol Building, using new evidence to show the White House was aware of the violence as Trump returned to the building. Trump has claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of the riot until later in the day, telling New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for her recent book that he was \u201con the late side\u201d of learning about the events at the Capitol.\u00a0 But the committee showed an email sent to Secret Service, national security and Trump\u2019s military advisers saying \u201chundreds of Trump supporters stormed through metal barricades at the back of the Capitol building about 1 pm Wednesday, running past security guards and breaking fences.\u201d The email was sent at 1:19 p.m. on Jan. 6. One minute later, Trump returned to the White House and was told about the violence, according to committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin. The committee played a series of clips from top aides to the President, suggesting Trump was watching television in the Oval Office dining room over the course of the afternoon, unwilling to intervene in the insurrection attempt. A former White House employee with national security responsibilities told the committee that a White House adviser, Eric Hershmann, told White House Counsel Pat Cipollone that \u201cthe President didn\u2019t want anything done.\u201d The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 US Capitol attack will vote to subpoena former President Donald Trump during Thursday\u2019s hearing, multiple sources tell CNN. If he chooses not to appear, there will be a few things that could happen next, according to Elie Honig, a CNN analyst and former federal prosecutor. Honig said that while it is \"unlikely\" that he will appear, he could \"theoretically\" testify. If he does not, and refuses to comply with the subpoena, the select committee will have to decide if they will vote to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress. If they do, it will then go to the full House for a vote, Honig said. \"If that passes, it goes to the\u00a0Justice Department where the DOJ,\u00a0the attorney general, Merrick\u00a0Garland, will have to decide \u2014 do\u00a0we bring criminal charges for\u00a0criminal contempt of Congress,\" he explained. Criminal contempt\u00a0is one of the three options the congressional panel can pursue to enforce its subpoenas, along with civil and inherent contempt. The Jan. 6 committee has done this before, including approving a criminal contempt report against\u00a0Trump ally Steve Bannon\u00a0after he refused to comply with a subpoena deadline. CNN's Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report Days before the Jan. 6 attack at the US Capitol, former President Donald Trump\u2019s communication adviser, Jason Miller, boasted to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that he \u201cgot the base FIRED UP,\u201d and shared a link to a pro-Trump webpage containing hundreds of threatening comments about killing lawmakers if they went ahead with certifying Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate electoral victory, according to a new text message presented by the House Select Committee on Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cI got the base FIRED UP,\u201d Miller texted Meadows on Dec. 30, 2020, appearing to take credit for amplifying the violent rhetoric about January 6 that was circulating on the pro-Trump website The Donald dot win.\u00a0 \u201cPatriots will be there, armed to the teeth. And if the filthy commie maggots try to push their fraud through, there will be hell to pay,\u201d one post presented by the committee reads.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur \u2018lawmakers\u2019 in Congress can leave one of two ways: 1. in a body bag 2. After rightfully certifying Trump the winner,\u201d another post on the webpage shared by Miller said. \u201cGallows don\u2019t require electricity,\u201d another post read.\u00a0\u00a0 Committee member Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said Thursday that Miller claimed he had no idea about the hundreds of comments like these in the link he sent to Mark Meadows. The committee played a video from Miller\u2019s deposition where he said he would have flagged something like that to the Secret Service.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut the Trump administration was aware of this type of violent rhetoric prior to January 6,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe Secret Service was monitoring this kind of online activity \u2026 the same day Jason Miller sent his text message, agents received reports about a spike in activity on another platform called Parler,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Watch the exchange: ##Investigation## Committee member Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said in Thursday's hearing that the US Secret Service had received alerts of online threats made against then-Vice President Mike Pence ahead of the Capitol insurrection, including that Pence would be \"'a dead man walking if he doesn't do the right thing.'\" \"On the morning of the 6th, agents received alerts of online threats that Vice President Pence would be, 'a dead man walking if he doesn't do the right thing,'\" said Schiff, a California Democrat.\u00a0 He continued: \"Another agent reported, 'I saw several other alerts saying they will storm the Capitol if he doesn't do the right thing.'\" On the day of the attack, Pence ultimately rejected pleas from Trump and his top allies to halt certification of Joe Biden's victory by the House and Senate, hours after he was forced to take shelter at a secure location inside the US Capitol while a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building \u2014 with some chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" as they breached security barriers. Former deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere told the committee in a video deposition that on the day of the attack, Trump talked at length about how \"fired up\" the crowd outside the White House waiting for his rally was. Asked by investigators what he said about it, Deere replied: \"Just that they were \u2014 they were fired up. They were angry. They feel like the election's been stolen, that the election was rigged, that \u2014 he went on and on about that for a little bit.\" The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is taking a short break during its 10th public hearing on Thursday. The committee is treating this presentation as a closing argument ahead of the November midterms, with the panel using never-before-seen video, interviews with additional witnesses and Secret Service messages, among other new evidence, to argue that former President Donald Trump remains a clear and present danger to democracy, particularly in the context of the\u00a0upcoming 2024 presidential election. Multiple sources have told CNN the panel will vote to subpoena former President Donald Trump during the hearing. Catch up on the hearing's key lines so far:\u00a0 Premeditated plan to declare victory: Deposition video and a memo obtained from the National Archives showed how former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s Counsel, Greg Jacob, and Pence\u2019s then-chief of staff Marc Short prepared for Trump to declare victory on Election Night, regardless of the results. \u201cWe also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election, even if he lost,\u201d committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.\nSecret Service messages: New Secret Service emails and text messages revealed agents spotted numerous guns in the crowd the morning of Jan. 6 before Trump was set to speak at the Ellipse.\u00a0Rep. Adam Schiff said that the intelligence indicated multiple online users were targeting members of Congress and instructing others to \u201cstart marching into the chambers.\u201d Messages also showed the Secret Service learned about the involvement of right-wing groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s rejected lawsuit: Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, said Trump said he didn\u2019t want \u201cpeople to know we lost\u201d after the Supreme Court rejected\u00a0a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the election\u00a0in December 2020.\u00a0\u201cJust fyi. POTUS is pissed \u2013 breaking news \u2013 Supreme Court denied his law suit. He is livid now,\u201d a Secret Service email said, presented by Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\nTrump knew he lost \u2014 but tried to change results anyway: Hutchinson also told the committee last month that Meadows told her in early 2021 that Trump knew that he lost the election, despite asking officials in Georgia to \"find\" the votes necessary for Trump to win the state. \u201cAnd he's like, 'No, Cass, you know, he knows it's over. He knows he lost. But we're going to keep trying,'\" Hutchinson told the committee. ##Catch Up## New Secret Service emails and text messages revealed by the Jan. 6 committee on Thursday show how the Secret Service released warnings in December 2020 that protesters could \u201cstart marching into the chambers\u201d on Jan. 6, 2021. The Secret Service text messages also showed that Secret Service agents spotted numerous guns in the crowd the morning of Jan. 6 before then-President Donald Trump was set to speak at the Ellipse.\u00a0 The emails and text messages are part of the more\u00a0than 1 million records that\u00a0the Jan. 6 committee obtained from the Secret Service since the first round of hearings wrapped over the summer. The committee obtained the information from the agency as it\u2019s continued to seek text messages from agents on Jan. 6 that were deleted.\u00a0 Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat on the panel, read a Secret Service alert received on Dec. 24, 2020, with a heading \u201cArmed and Ready, Mr. President.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Schiff said that the intelligence indicated multiple online users were targeting members of Congress and instructing others to \u201cstart marching into the chambers.\u201d\u00a0 In a Dec. 26 email, a Secret Service field office relayed a tip that the Proud Boys planned to march into Washington armed \u201cand will outnumber the police so they can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTheir plan is to literally kill people. Please please take this tip seriously and investigate further,\u201d the tip read. \u201cThe Secret Service had advance information more than 10 days beforehand regarding the Proud Boys planning for Jan. 6,\u201d Schiff said.\u00a0 On Jan. 5, 2021, a Secret Service learned during an FBI briefing that right-wing groups were establishing \u201cquick reaction forces\u201d in Virginia. Groups like the far-right Oath Keepers were \u201cstanding by at the ready should POTUS request assistance,\u201d Schiff said that a Secret Service email about the briefing read.\u00a0 On Jan. 6, Secret Service agents sent reports from around the Ellipse, where Trump\u2019s rally was being held. The reports included numerous reports of members of the crowd being armed, including one individual with a Glock and another with a rifle. Another report said a man in a tree had a pistol on his hip. Another individual detained in downtown Washington had an assault rifle. One Secret Service agent texted at 12:36 p.m. ET that day, according to the committee, \u201cWith so many weapons found so far; you wonder how many are unknown. Could be sporty after dark.\u201d Another agent responded minutes later, \u201cNo doubt. The people at the Ellipse said they are moving to the Capitol after the POTUS speech.\u201d ##Investigation## As the Jan. 6 hearing unfolded, the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0rejected an emergency request from former President Donald Trump to intervene in the dispute over classified documents seized from\u00a0his\u00a0Mar-a-Lago estate in August.\u00a0 Trump had asked the justices to reverse a federal appeals\u00a0court\u00a0and allow a special master to review about 100 documents marked classified, a move that could have opened the door for his legal team to review the records and argue that they should be off limits to prosecutors in a criminal case.\u00a0 But in a brief order, the\u00a0court\u00a0denied the request.\u00a0There were no noted dissents. For now, the documents marked classified will stay out of the reach of the special master. The\u00a0court\u2019s decision steers the\u00a0court\u00a0away from the political fray at a time when approval ratings of the 6-3 conservative-leaning\u00a0court\u00a0have dipped to new lows, and as liberals including President Joe Biden have attacked the legitimacy of the institution. Last term, the\u00a0court, including three of Trump\u2019s three appointees, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, ruled against Trump in a document dispute concerning the House Jan. 6 committee. Only Justice Clarence Thomas stated publicly that he would have ruled in Trump\u2019s favor. Calling the records \"extraordinarily sensitive,\" the Justice Department had asked the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0to stay out of the dispute while legal challenges play out.\u00a0 \"As this\u00a0Court\u00a0has emphasized,\u00a0courts should be cautious before 'insisting upon an examination' of records whose disclosure would jeopardize national security 'even by the judge alone, in chambers,'\" DOJ wrote earlier this week, citing a past case. At issue are two orders US District Judge Aileen Cannon issued last month. She has authorized a special master to review thousands of seized documents \u2014including those with classified markings. Earlier, Cannon temporarily enjoined the Justice Department from using the subset of documents as a part of its ongoing criminal probe.\u00a0 \u00a0A panel of judges on the 11th US Circuit\u00a0Court\u00a0of Appeals, however, acting upon a request from the Justice Department, agreed to freeze portions of those orders while the legal dispute plays out.\u00a0 Trump has argued that he may have had a right, as a former president, to possess certain government documents, including documents potentially containing the country's most sensitive secrets. And he claimed that the appeals\u00a0court\u00a0exceeded its authority in ruling against him. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 US Capitol attack will vote to subpoena former President Donald Trump during Thursday\u2019s hearing, multiple sources tell CNN. At the beginning of the hearing, the committee's chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, announced that the panel has changed today\u2019s hearing to a business meeting, which is a technical difference but means the committee can\u00a0vote on investigative actions.\u00a0 NBC was first to report on the plan. Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, told the Jan. 6 committee last month, in a video deposition, that Meadows told her in early 2021 that former President Trump knew that he lost the election, despite asking officials in Georgia to \"find\" the votes necessary for Trump to win the state. \"I remember looking at Mark, and I said 'Mark, he can't possibly think we're going to pull this off. Like, that call was crazy.' And he looked at me and just started shaking his head. And he's like, 'No, Cass, you know, he knows it's over. He knows he lost. But we're going to keep trying,'\" Hutchinson told the House select committee. \"This call and other related activity is now the focus of an ongoing criminal investigation in Fulton County, Georgia,\" Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia said during the hearing.  She added, \"And Georgia is not the only state where President Trump tried to pressure state officials to change the results. He also attempted to pressure state officials in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan to change the results in those states as well.\" CNN\u00a0reported earlier this week\u00a0that Hutchinson is cooperating with the Fulton County probe. The Georgia probe \u2014 set off by an hour-long Jan. 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to \"find\" the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State \u2014 has steadily expanded.  It now covers presentations on unfounded election fraud claims to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county and a campaign of threats and harassment against lower-level election workers. ##Testimony## The House select committee highlighted the seditious conspiracy case against Kelly Meggs, an alleged member of the far-right Oath Keepers, whose members stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\u00a0 Meggs and four other members of the Oath Keepers, including its leader Stewart Rhodes, are currently on trial in Washington, DC, in a courthouse that\u2019s just a few blocks from the Capitol. Defense attorneys for the alleged Oath Keepers have repeatedly complained that the widely publicized congressional hearings make it difficult or impossible for their clients to get a fair trial. The judge has rejected several of their attempts to postpone the trial or move it out of DC. The defendants pleaded not guilty to seditious conspiracy and a slew of other felony charges. Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, told the Jan. 6 committee that former President Donald Trump said he didn\u2019t want \u201cpeople to know we lost\u201d after the Supreme Court rejected\u00a0a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the election\u00a0in   2020. In a video deposition played during Thursday\u2019s hearing, Hutchinson described Trump\u2019s conversation with Meadows after the Supreme Court decision.\u00a0She said she was present during the conversation. \u201cThe President was fired up about the Supreme Court decision,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe President said \u2026 something to the effect of, \u2018I don\u2019t want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. Figure it out. We need to figure it out. I don\u2019t want people to know that we lost.\u2019\u201d Revelations from a Secret Service email: Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican on the committee, also\u00a0showed a Secret Service email about how Trump reacted following the Dec. 11, 2020, decision. The\u00a0email is\u00a0part of the trove of new information that it received from the agency in the months since the last hearing. \u201cJust fyi. POTUS is pissed \u2013 breaking news \u2013 Supreme Court denied his law suit. He is livid now,\u201d the email said.\u00a0 The Hutchinson testimony and the Secret Service email provide new detail into Trump\u2019s state of mind as one of his last avenues to overturning the election was blocked\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the bid from the Texas attorney general seeking to overturn the results of four other states that the\u00a0Supreme Court rejected. Watch Hutchinson's video deposition:  \u00a0##Testimony## The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new evidence Thursday that former President Donald Trump had a premeditated plan \u2014\u00a0devised\u00a0before any votes had been counted \u2014 to declare victory no matter what the election results were. \u201cThe evidence shows that his false victory speech was planned well in advance, before any votes had been counted. It was a premeditated plan by the President to declare victory no matter what the actual result was,\u201d committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California, said on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election, even if he lost,\u201d Lofgren added.\u00a0 The evidence presented Thursday includes video from the committee\u2019s deposition of former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s Counsel, Greg Jacob, during which\u00a0Jacob describes how he and Pence\u2019s then-chief of staff Marc Short prepared for Trump to declare victory on Election Night, regardless of the results. \u201cMarc had indicated to me that there was a possibility that there would be a declaration of victory within the White House that some might push for \u2013 and this is prior to the election results being known \u2013 and he was trying to figure out a way of avoiding the Vice President sort of being thrust into a position of needing to opine on that when he might not have sufficient information to do so,\u201d Jacob says in the video clip. After this conversation on Nov. 3, 2020, Jacob drafted a memo to Short, which the committee said it obtained from the National Archives and presented for the first time on Thursday.\u00a0 \u201c\u00a0\u2026 it is essential that the Vice President not be perceived by the public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts,\u201d the memo reads. More of the committee's revelations: The committee also revealed an email conservative legal activist Tom Fitton\u00a0sent\u00a0to two Trump advisers a few days before the election that contains a draft statement for Trump to declare victory on election night.\u00a0 The draft prepared statement, sent to Trump aides Molly Michael and Dan Scavino on Oct. 31, 2020, declares: \u201cWe had an election today, and I won.\u201d It also emphasizes that only the votes \u201ccounted by the Election Day deadline\u201d would matter, even though the former President was aware that vote counting would lawfully continue past election day. Another email from Fitton to Michael and Scavino that day notes that he \u201cjust talked to him about the draft below,\u201d an apparent reference to Trump himself.\u00a0 Trump was warned by advisers on Election Night that it was \u201cfar too early to make any proclamation\u201d of victory, according to video of the former President\u2019s then-campaign manager Bill Stepien that was presented by the committee, but went ahead and declared victory anyway.\u00a0 ##Testimony## GOP Rep. Liz Cheney laid out the committee's case that former President Donald Trump was the \"central cause\" of the Jan. 6 riot during her opening statements for today's hearing.  \"The vast weight of evidence\u00a0presented so far has shown us\u00a0that the central cause of\u00a0Jan. 6 was one man, Donald\u00a0Trump, who many others followed,\" Cheney said. She continued, \"None of this would have happened\u00a0without him.\u00a0He was personally and\u00a0substantially involved in all of\u00a0it.\u00a0Exactly how did one man cause\u00a0all of this?\u00a0Today we will focus on President\u00a0Trump's state of mind, his\u00a0intent, his motivations and how\u00a0he spurred others to do his\u00a0bidding.\u00a0And how another Jan. 6\u00a0could happen again if we do not\u00a0take necessary action to prevent\u00a0it.\"  Watch Rep. Liz Cheney give her opening remarks: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, provided a preview of what's to come during today's high-profile hearing during his opening remarks, saying that \"new evidence\" will be unveiled, including new testimony from Republicans who served in the administration of former President Donald Trump.  \"Today, as in previous proceedings, my colleagues and I will present new evidence. That includes new testimony from additional Republicans who served in the Trump administration, never-before-seen footage of congressional leaders on January 6 working to coordinate the response to the violence and ensure the people's business went forward, new materials produced to the committee by the Secret Service, details about the ongoing threat to American democracy,\" Thompson said.  He added that the hearing will look somewhat different from prior hearings as they \"take a step back and look at the evidence in a broader context, providing a summary of key facts we've uncovered. Facts relevant to former President Trump's state of mind, about his motivation and about his intent.\"  ##Investigation##  The chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said evidence the panel has displayed throughout their 10 public hearings has mostly came from Republican witnesses. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the \"facts and testimony are clear\" and well-documented. He said that the most \"striking fact\" of the committee's work is that these facts came \"almost entirely from\" Republicans and people who worked closely with former President Donald Trump.  \"The evidence that has emerged\u00a0did not come from Democrats or\u00a0opponents of Donald Trump.\u00a0Instead, look at who has written\u00a0evidence,\" Thompson said. Thompson cited White House aides and campaign officials who worked for Trump, Republican state officials, Republican electors, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Trump political appointees in the Justice Department and even members of Trump\u2019s family. The committee has used video-taped depositions from those around Trump \u2013 testimony often obtained via subpoena \u2013 throughout the panel\u2019s hearings over the summer to illustrate how Trump was told he lost the election and warned that his efforts to overturn it could result in violence. CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.  GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has been key to ensuring that former President Donald Trump remains the central focus to these hearings, as he will be again today, sources say.\u00a0\u00a0 While at times other members had wanted to broaden the focus, Cheney ultimately convinced her colleagues to keep the focus on Trump to ensure there\u2019s no question about who was responsible for the violence that ensued Jan. 6, 2021.\u00a0 Members have said they want to spotlight Trump\u2019s intentions and state of mind today. But a key challenge for the committee is connecting some of these dots directly to Trump.  They\u2019ve been able to tie some of Trump\u2019s close allies directly to extremist groups but have struggled to make the connection to Trump personally.\u00a0 The public hearings with Trump at the center are also a springboard for Cheney\u2019s political plans, as she vows to do whatever is necessary to keep Trump from the White House in 2024. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol has begun its hearing.  Sources tell CNN\u00a0the committee plans to lay out its case that former President Donald Trump remains a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d over his efforts to overturn the election in 2020 and what that means for a 2024 campaign where he\u2019s a potential Republican frontrunner. And committee aides told reporters on Wednesday that the hearing will examine Trump\u2019s \u201cstate of mind,\u201d in addition to events leading up to and following the Jan. 6 riot.  Thursday\u2019s hearing will \u201cbring a particular focus on the former President\u2019s state of mind and his involvement in these events as they unfolded,\u201d committee aides said. Committee aides indicated there won\u2019t be any live witnesses at Thursday\u2019s hearing, but said there would be video testimony and documentary evidence that hasn\u2019t been seen before. House Republican leadership plan to center their messaging on inflation and the economy, a source tells CNN, adding that today's Jan. 6 hearing has not been a key focus for them during strategy meetings this week.  Some of the prominent House GOP Twitter accounts \u2014 which have previously landed in hot water for their aggressive responses to past hearings, including a now-deleted and widely criticized tweet attacking witness Sarah Matthews \u2014 are also expected to dial down their tone today, two sources tell CNN.\u00a0 While House Republicans may still might put out a few tweets about the hearing, it is not expected to be the same level of rapid response we have seen during previous hearings.\u00a0\u00a0 There are several reasons for the shift in strategy: One, House Republicans are less worried about this hearing, since it is not in prime time and will not feature live witnesses.  Two, they are betting voters ahead of the midterms will care more about today\u2019s economic news than today\u2019s hearing. And three, some of their more aggressive tweets have previously backfired.\u00a0 The House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold the panel's last hearing before the midterm elections. The session will provide the panel with one more opportunity to hammer home its message that former President Donald Trump is still dangerous to democracy. Here are some key things to watch for once the hearing kicks off at 1 p.m. ET:  No witnesses \u2013 but new evidence: Committee aides indicated there won\u2019t be any live witnesses at Thursday\u2019s hearing, but said there would be video testimony and documentary evidence that hasn\u2019t been seen before. Sources say some of the new evidence will come from new witnesses who only spoke to the committee in recent months, which could include several of Trump\u2019s former Cabinet secretaries: Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and\u00a0former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Other portions of new testimony will come from witnesses the committee has presented in previous hearings, aides say. Since its last hearing in July, the committee has received more than\u00a0a million communications from the Secret Service\u00a0from the lead-up to the riot. Committee aides told reporters Wednesday that the upcoming hearing will feature some of that new material, including emails and video handed over by the service. Recapping the panel\u2019s summer sessions: It\u2019s been nearly three months since the committee last held a public hearing, and committee members are likely to use Thursday\u2019s session to recap to viewers what the panel unearthed in its series of summer hearings. The committee showed testimony from numerous former aides of former President Donald Trump to make its case that Trump was told he lost the election, was behind plans to try to overturn his loss to Joe Biden and was warned that Jan. 6 could turn violent. Thursday\u2019s hearing gives the committee one last chance before the midterms to remind potential voters about the case they\u2019ve built against Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the election and the violence that ensued at the Capitol. A committee chorus One of the unique features of the committee\u2019s series of summer hearings was that each was led by a different committee member or two \u2013 meaning a majority of panel members did not speak at any given hearing. It was a quite un-Congress-like posture for congressional hearings, where the January 6 committee\u2019s choreographed presentations replaced the typical scattershot sessions where every member gets five minutes to question witnesses or make a speech. The committee\u2019s final hearing is still likely to go as the panel plans it \u2013 the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the committee are all working together on the sprawling investigation. But for the first time, every member of the committee will have a speaking role at Thursday\u2019s hearing, according to aides, as each presents a different portion of the committee\u2019s presentation. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is going into Thursday's hearing with the intention of refocusing on Donald Trump himself \u2014 his \u201caction and inaction\u201d and his \u201ccentral culpability\u201d in the riot, according to two sources familiar with the panel's plans. New material from the Secret Service will help show Trump's role leading up to and on the day of Jan. 6, the sources say. Over the last few weeks, the committee has been weighed whether to use this hearing to name specific election deniers in the Republican Party to showcase their argument that Trump's election lies are a major threat to democracy. But they want to instead keep the focus squarely on Trump, according to a source familiar with the internal discussion When Americans could see a report: Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson has told reporters in the past that the committee will release an interim report before midterms. But another source involved in writing the report said that putting together an interim report before the midterms seems increasingly unlikely given the limited time they have. The concern that doing so would take away from the larger report they plan to release by year's end. ##Investigation## Amid multiple investigations into former President Donald Trump and a constant news cycle of seemingly damning revelations, Trump aides, allies and advisers, both current and former, are on edge ahead of today\u2019s\u00a0Jan. 6th\u00a0hearing.  The hearing is the first since the Justice Department subpoenaed dozens connected to Trump in their own investigation into\u00a0the Jan. 6 riot, which some believe was based off evidence presented during the committee\u2019s televised hearings. Once blustery on what they alleged was a \u201cpolitical witch hunt,\u201d has now become nervous anticipation.\u00a0 \u201cIf I\u2019m in the background of a video, is the [Justice Department] going to come after me?\u201d one source close to Trump asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next shoe to drop?\u201d Thousands of documents have been turned over to the Department of Justice, but some of those subpoenaed have yet to be interviewed, and hope never to have to do so.\u00a0 But while his aides may be wringing their hands before the hearing, multiple sources tell CNN that Trump is focused on the larger legal issues he is facing.\u00a0 \"I'm not sure if you noticed, but he has a lot going on right now,\" another source in Trump's orbit said, referring to the number of investigations and court cases surrounding the former President. Multiple sources said that Trump has been particularly fixated on the back-and-forth over the documents seized from Mar-a-lago during the August FBI search, which some experts believe put him in the most legal jeopardy. In recent days, Trump has ranted both privately and publicly that he is being treated unfairly and differently than past presidents in terms of his handling of presidential records. The National Archives has pushed back on some of these claims.\u00a0 House Republicans have completed their own report on Jan. 6 security failures, but are waiting to release the document until the House select committee unveils their final report on their investigation into the Capitol riot, according to a GOP source familiar with the situation. Republicans want their report to serve as a counter narrative to the one presented by the select committee, and since today\u2019s hearing is not in prime time and is not expected to include live witnesses, they decided to save their main rebuttal for later. The GOP report and investigation, which was conducted at the behest of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is expected to narrowly focus on the security and intelligence failures that led up to Jan. 6 and will seek to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 not Donald Trump \u2014 for the Capitol breach. Any new evidence from the Jan. 6 committee\u2019s hearing on Thursday could highlight what the Justice Department is arguing in secret court proceedings a short distance away from the Capitol.\u00a0 A federal judge has been overseeing a fight by Donald Trump to prevent key White House witnesses from testifying in the broader investigation into Jan. 6 and efforts to impede the transfer of power after the 2020 election.\u00a0 Trump is trying to limit what former witnesses can testify, some of whom have already talked to the Jan. 6 committee.\u00a0 Federal prosecutors don\u2019t have full access to what the committee has, but prosecutors are pushing for witnesses to be allowed to testify beyond the narrow parameters Trump is trying to set. Trump is arguing privilege rights, including attorney-client and executive privilege, should shield witnesses like former Vice President Mike Pence aides, Greg Jacob and Marc Short, as well as White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, from bring compelled to provide certain testimony.\u00a0 A judge is weighing whether the events surrounding the efforts by Trump to remain in office despite losing the election supersede any privilege rights the former president may have. ##Investigation## The Jan. 6 committee is still wrangling over whether and when to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but in the meantime, it is aiming to showcase evidence that could be of use to prosecutors who plan to monitor today\u2019s hearing, sources tell CNN. The panel has already had success in nudging prosecutors toward new information.  The committee recently sent a letter seeking a voluntary interview with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. That interview hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet. But in the meantime, prosecutors in Georgia fired off a subpoena seeking Gingrich\u2019s testimony \u2013 and citing the letter from the\u00a0Jan. 6\u00a0committee.\u00a0\u00a0 The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is expected to use US Secret Service messages today to show that the agency was aware of violent rhetoric directed at government officials on the social media site Parler ahead of the riot, a source with direct knowledge tells CNN. In particular, one agent reported an increased in chatter focused on Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 5, a day before the attack. The committee also has messages showing how the Secret Service was aware that that people in the Jan. 6 crowd had weapons, such as bear spray, riot shields and were armed with guns. They were aware that people were wearing body armor, ballistic helmets and had radio equipment and military grade backpacks.  The source said the committee has an email from the Secret Service saying they were aware Trump was \"pissed\" that the US Supreme Court on Dec. 11, 2020, threw out an effort to overturn the election. The email will help show that they were aware of Trump's mindset, the source said. Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, came before the House committee in recent days but was not videotaped during her interview, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\u00a0 This was the result of an agreement with her lawyer, a source told CNN.\u00a0She is not expected to play a major role in the hearing today but the committee has been planning to display some of what she said through graphics, one of the sources said. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the committee, told CNN recently that Thomas reaffirmed her belief that the election was stolen during her closed door interview. House select committee aides say they plan to look at a broader timeline in today\u2019s hearing, addressing former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to lay the groundwork to overturn the election and how he continued those efforts even after the Jan. 6 riot.   The expanded timeline is meant to show that Trump was central to the scheme that led to the violence on Jan. 6\u00a0and to reinforce that notion that his continued embrace of election lies remains a danger ahead of the 2022 and 2024 elections.  As part of their new evidence today, the hearing will also feature new footage showing efforts to respond in real time to the violence on Jan. 6.  ##Investigation## Twenty one months after the riot at the US Capitol, the Justice Department has arrested more than 880 individuals, charging roughly 272 with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers that day \u2013 95 of whom are charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer.\u00a0\u00a0 Roughly 280 Capitol rioters have been sentenced so far, with over 152 receiving jail time.\u00a0Twenty individuals have been found guilty at contested trials. Another five individuals have been convicted following an agreed-upon set of facts. \u00a0 But the investigation is nowhere close to being over. The Justice Department is still looking for more than 360 individuals who they say, \u201ccommitted violent acts on Capitol grounds.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 There was an estimated $2.7 million in damage to the Capitol, an amount slowly being paid for in part by convicted rioters who have agreed to pay restitution for the damage as part of plea agreements with the government. So far, however, the total number of restitution and fines judges have ordered January 6 rioters pay is over $375,000, according to CNN\u2019s tally.\u00a0 Roughly 140 police officers were assaulted during the attack on the Capitol, including approximately 80 U.S. Capitol Police and 60 Metropolitan Police officers, according to the Justice Department.\u00a0 Officer Brian Sicknick died of a stroke on Jan. 7, and four additional officers \u2013 Metropolitan Police Department Officers Gunther Hashida, Kyle DeFreytag and Jeffrey Smith, and Capitol Police officer Howard Liebengood \u2013 died of suicide in the months after the attack.\u00a0\u00a0 In all five jury trials, Jan. 6 defendants have been convicted of each count they faced. One Jan. 6 defendant was acquitted in a bench trial before Judge Trevor McFadden after arguing that he believed an officer waved him into the building.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Investigation## The House select committee investigating the\u00a0Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol\u00a0will treat its Thursday hearing as a closing argument ahead of the November midterms, which will seek to hammer home that former President Donald Trump remains a clear and present danger to democracy, particularly in the context of the\u00a0upcoming 2024 presidential election, multiple sources tell CNN. Although there will not be witnesses appearing in-person on Thursday, sources say, the hearing will feature new testimony and evidence that the committee has uncovered. Since its last hearing in July, the committee has interviewed more former members of Trump\u2019s cabinet, received more than a\u00a0million communications from the Secret Service\u00a0from the lead-up to the riot, and\u00a0sat down with Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. \u201cWe discovered through our work through this summer what the President\u2019s intentions were, what he knew, what he did, what others did,\u201d committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren told CNN on Tuesday evening, referring to the material gathered since the panel\u2019s last hearing in July. What will be presented in today's hearing: Some of the evidence presented on Thursday will come from new witnesses, sources say, which could include Trump\u2019s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin, and former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Some of the new testimony will come from witnesses the committee has presented in previous hearings. Committee members have insisted, albeit with few details, that they will bring new information to the forefront. \u201cI do think it will be worth watching,\u201d Lofgren said on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d Tuesday evening. \u201cThere\u2019s some new material that I found, as we got into it, pretty surprising.\u201d That will likely include previously unseen video and also new Secret Service emails, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The trove of communications between agents could reveal more about why certain\u00a0messages were deleted\u00a0on the days leading up to and on the day of the Capitol attack. As part of its closing message, the committee will frame the US Capitol attack within a broader context and emphasize that the \u201cdanger to our democracy did not end that day,\u201d according to Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff. The reason, Schiff told reporters last week, is because Trump and his allies continue to push the same baseless claims about the 2020 election that led to the violence nearly two years ago. While Schiff declined to discuss specific themes that will be covered during Thursday\u2019s hearing, he made clear that the committee plans to focus not only on how Trump\u2019s failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election culminated in his supporters ultimately storming the US Capitol on Jan. 6 but how the former President remains a threat to democracy. \u201cI think that what you\u2019ve seen consistently and increasingly is Donald Trump continuing to suggest and to say the same things that we know caused violence on January 6,\u201d GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who serves as vice chair of the committee, told CNN. ##Investigation## The day before the 2020 election,\u00a0Roger Stone, the long-time Republican operative and ally of former President\u00a0Donald Trump, said in front of a documentary film crew that he had no interest in waiting to tally actual votes before contesting the election results. \u201cF**k the voting, let\u2019s get right to the violence,\u201d Stone can be heard saying, according to footage provided by a Danish documentary film crew and obtained by CNN. The clip is one of multiple pieces of footage obtained by CNN that the filmmakers also shared with the House select committee investigating the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The video shows Stone as an early proponent of contesting the election \u2013 even before the results were in \u2013 and raising the possibility of violence months before January 6. The filmmakers tell CNN they came to an agreement to share certain clips with the committee after a subpoena for the footage was signed by the panel\u2019s chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, and delivered to the filmmakers in Copenhagen about two months ago. The filmmakers, Christoffer Guldbrandsen and Frederik Marbell, followed Stone for portions of about three years for their documentary film. The footage shared with the committee may be incorporated into its upcoming hearing this week. Committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, suggested publicly over the weekend that the panel has more to reveal about the connection between Stone and domestic extremist groups, as well as efforts to keep Trump in power after the US Capitol attack and the ongoing threats to democracy. \u201cStay tuned,\u201d Raskin said at the Texas Tribune festival last month when asked about Stone\u2019s possible connections to the Capitol riot. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who I think saw where things were going,\u201d Raskin said. In an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, the filmmakers said the committee appeared interested in footage that focused on Stone\u2019s relationship with the White House, and also his alleged ties to the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. The filmmakers said they were not able to establish a link between Stone, those groups and the White House. Read more about the documentary here.  The Justice Department\u2019s response to the\u00a0Jan. 6 US Capitol assault\u00a0is meeting one of its biggest tests yet as prosecutors present their case for why the alleged plotting of several far-right militia members ahead of the attack amounted to a seditious conspiracy. The charge has rarely been brought in the century and a half that the statute and its forerunners have been on the books. By using it against members of the Oath Keepers the Justice Department is expressing that it sees the breach of the Capitol as a grave threat to the operation of the US government. \u201cThey concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy,\u201d prosecutor Jeffrey Nestler told jurors as the trial began in a Washington, DC,\u00a0federal\u00a0courthouse on Oct. 3. \u201cTo charge someone with seditious conspiracy is to send a signal that not only have they done a bunch of bad stuff,\u201d said Alan Rozenshtein, a former official in the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, \u201cbut that they\u2019ve done bad stuff that rises to the level where we as the government want to express that this is an attack on the basic functioning of a democratic system and is even more dangerous for that reason.\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland balked at initial efforts to add the charge to Oath Keepers case,\u00a0CNN previously reported, but as the case developed, investigators were able to build out the evidence with cooperators and internal communications. The charge was added in a superseding indictment unveiled in January. That symbolic significance has been lingering over the trial happening in the DC federal courthouse. There, five alleged members of the Oath Keepers, including leader Stewart Rhodes,\u00a0are facing a jury considering whether to convict them of the charge\u00a0and of other alleged crimes. They\u2019re accused of planning to use force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power, with the grand jury indictment alleging that they \u201ccoordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, DC, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes\u2019s call to take up arms at Rhodes\u2019s direction.\u201d The defendants have pleaded not guilty. Read more about the trial here.  Members of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. The committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\u00a0 Rep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\u00a0 Here's who is on the panel: Democrats:\u00a0 Chair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\u00a0\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California \nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\nRep. Adam Schiff of California  Republicans\u00a0 Vice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois Over the course of the summer\u2019s hearings, the Jan. 6 committee tapped into the hundreds of taped depositions, as well as key witnesses who testified live, to\u00a0present a devastating case\u00a0that former President Donald Trump sought multiple avenues to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election even after he was told he lost. Here's a refresher on some of the biggest revelations: Secret Service incident.\u00a0Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide in the Trump White House,\u00a0testified\u00a0about hearing a secondhand account of how Trump was so enraged at his Secret Service detail for blocking him from going to the US Capitol that he lunged to the front of his vehicle and tried to turn the wheel. Hutchinson also testified that she heard her boss, then-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, say that Trump seemed to agree with the suggestion from some rioters, caught on tape that day, that Pence should be hanged. Corrupt pressure campaign.\u00a0The panel used the fourth hearing to detail the private and public effects that Trump\u2019s pressure campaign had on election officials. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told the committee he and his family faced threats he believed were attempts to make him quit over his unwillingness to participate in overturning the election. Plan to replace the then-attorney general. During the fifth hearing, the panel described a January 2021 meeting where the then-President considered replacing acting Attorney General Jefferey Rosen with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who became a proponent of Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims. Trump\u2019s failure to act.\u00a0The committee used its final hearing this summer to detail the 187 minutes Trump refused to act while the Capitol was under attack, despite learning about the assault just minutes after he returned to the White House. ##Investigation## ##Catch Up## The United States Secret Service has, in the last two weeks, given\u00a0the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol nearly 1.5 million communications from the lead-up to the attack, including emails and planning documents, according to an agency spokesman. The data dump represents another large volume of records provided to congressional investigators as the panel prepared to hold its final planned public hearing before the midterms. CNN previously reported the Secret Service gave\u00a0hundreds of thousands of records\u00a0to both the Department of Homeland Security inspector general and the Jan. 6 committee. The latest batch of records, which was first reported by\u00a0NBC News, does not include the text messages lost to a data migration that prompted a criminal probe by the inspector general. The DHS appointed a special counsel to review materials from the Secret Service to ensure the agency could satisfy the January 6 committee\u2019s probe without running afoul of the IG\u2019s criminal inquiry, which demanded the\u00a0Secret Service halt its investigation into missing texts. CNN has previously reported\u00a0that the committee has received around 800,000 pages of materials from the Secret Service in response to a subpoena since July, as the committee continues to investigate why certain text messages from Secret Service agents went missing from Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has described the trove of documents the Secret Service provided as \u201csignificant information.\u201d ##Investigation## The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has been able to uncover much of the multi-faceted plot to subvert the 2020 presidential election. But as it heads into its final hearing before the midterms, there are a few investigative threads that remain unanswered. The committee has presented evidence that former President Donald Trump wanted to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6, eliciting testimony from numerous witnesses describing the former President's urgent desire to be driven to the Capitol complex by his Secret Service detail following his speech on the Ellipse. It also has established that Trump anticipated staying in office.\u00a0 Yet the committee has not been able to uncover precisely what Trump planned to do upon arriving at the Capitol, a source familiar with its investigation says, and attributes the gap in knowledge to the limited subpoena power of the committee. It also has been unable to definitively conclude if Trump had a plan. Instead, the committee has developed a number of working theories, the source says. Understanding Trump's intentions for going to the Capitol on Jan. 6 would provide insight into his state of mind that day and could expose more potentially criminal activity, as the committee has sought to do throughout its investigation and hearings. Among the biggest questions hanging over the committee ahead of its hearing Thursday is whether it will make a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Multiple members on the committee have told CNN the panel has still not reached a decision. Speaking at the Texas Tribune festival last month, committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, said \"I think we will be unanimous\" when asked how the panel will approach the process of whether to make a criminal referral.\u00a0 There is also a growing sense among committee members that the Justice Department will be able to fill in some of the unanswered questions left by the committee's investigation because of the subpoena power that comes with its ongoing criminal investigation, particularly when it comes to senior officials from Trump's orbit like his former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and longtime confidante Roger Stone, who cited various claims of privilege to limit cooperation with the congressional panel. ##Investigation## In the months since the last July hearing, the\u00a0FBI searched the former President\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate\u00a0as part of its investigation into the apparent mishandling and retention of sensitive government documents. In a separate probe, the Justice Department has fired off subpoenas to dozens of individuals connected to Trump, as its investigation into efforts to\u00a0subvert the 2020 election intensifies and expands. The hearing also comes less than a month before the\u00a0midterm elections\u00a0and the committee is expected to focus on the former President\u2019s continued efforts to claim the 2020 election was stolen and put GOP election deniers in office. \u201cThere remains a clear and present danger to our electoral system and to democratic institutions. So, that is something that will come through in our final hearing. This is not ancient history we\u2019re talking about, this is a continuing threat,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland told CNN. \u201cI think the single most urgent question is OK, what is the continuing clear and present danger we face now from the forces that Donald Trump unleashed,\" he added.  Still, committee members have insisted, albeit with few details, that they will bring new information to the forefront. \u201cI do think it will be worth watching,\u201d Democratic\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Zoe Lofgren\u00a0of California said on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d Tuesday evening. \u201cThere\u2019s some new material that I found, as we got into it, pretty surprising.\u201d The House select committee investigating the Capitol Hill insurrection\u00a0concluded its series of eight hearings\u00a0over the summer with a presentation intended to be the final piece of its narrative puzzle that painted former President Donald Trump as responsible for the\u00a0violent attack on the US Capitol\u00a0\u2013 and more broadly, American democracy \u2013 on Jan. 6, 2021. Over the course of the two months\u2019 worth of hearings, the committee tapped into the hundreds of taped depositions, as well as key witnesses who testified live, to present a devastating case that Trump sought multiple avenues to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election even after he was told he lost, that the former President knew ahead of time January 6 could turn violent, and that he chose not to act when his supporters attacked the Capitol and put the lives of lawmakers \u2013 not to mention his own vice president \u2013 in danger. The panel\u2019s set of eight hearings were remarkable for multiple reasons filling out the details about how the US Capitol came under attack on Jan. 6.  Here's a recap of some of the key things revealed so far:  All the President\u2019s men (and women): For two years, congressional Democrats ran into White House stonewalling while they tried to investigate all aspects of the Trump administration. Beyond some notable exceptions \u2013 notably the officials who came forward during Trump\u2019s first impeachment \u2013 the blockade was successful at evading accountability. Things have been different with the Jan. 6 committee. Former White House officials by and large came forward and spoke to the committee, which conducted more than 1,000 interviews in all. Some required a\u00a0subpoena, but everyone from Trump\u2019s former personal assistant Nick Luna to spokesman Jason Miller to former White House counsel Pat Cipollone testified before the panel in videotaped depositions. The White House power vacuum: There was a consistent theme throughout the January 6 hearings: Trump was told over and over again that the election hadn\u2019t been stolen and he couldn\u2019t overturn it, but he ignored that advice and found confidantes who told him what he wanted to hear. Instead of listening to Barr or Cipollone, he turned to Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, lawyers who told him the election had been stolen. When Barr\u2019s replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, also refused to embrace Trump\u2019s baseless fraud claims, the President considered replacing him with someone who did, Jeffrey Clark. Instead of taking the advice of Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 who waited until the Electoral College affirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory on December 14 to declare Biden president-elect \u2013 Trump cut off communication with McConnell and embraced House Republicans plotting to reject electors through Congress on January 6. No one, it appeared, was able to stand up to Trump and tell him he had to stand down. The toll of January 6 on civil servants: At several points across the hearings, the January 6 committee made a point to illustrate how Trump\u2019s attacks on the election and the violence that occurred at the Capitol had impacts that went far beyond the political realm. At the committee\u2019s opening hearing, Capitol police officer\u00a0Caroline Edwards\u00a0testified about the injuries she suffered at the hands of rioters. The committee brought in state officials like Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, who received numerous threats after Trump had lashed out at them. One of the most heart-wrenching moments came from the\u00a0testimony\u00a0of Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who were volunteer election workers in Atlanta during the 2020 election.

  "title": "7 takeaways from the January 6 hearing",
  "date": "2022-10-14T04:30:01Z",
  "text": "The House select committee's final hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection before the midterm elections Thursday used new testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The committee's hearing used new records obtained from the Secret Service and new deposition footage from former Trump Cabinet secretaries and White House officials to bolster the argument that Trump still remains a danger to democracy heading into the 2024 election. Here are the takeaways from the committee's latest January 6 hearing: Committee votes to subpoena former President The committee voted Thursday to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony, marking an escalation in the panel's efforts to obtain testimony from the former President. The committee's leaders argued that Trump was at the center of efforts to overturn the 2020 election that led to the violence of the insurrection, and as a result they needed Trump's testimony to tell the complete story of January 6. \"We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion,\" said Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the panel's top Republican. \"And every American is entitled to the answers, so we can act now to protect our republic.\" And select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, argued that Trump \"is the one person at the center of the story of what happened on January 6th. So we want to hear from him.\" Of course, the panel is issuing the subpoena nearing the end of recognition as a select committee, which is likely an acknowledgment that Trump is not going to comply. Should Trump object to the subpoena, it could lead to a lengthy court fight that outlives the committee. That's because if Republicans take back control of the House, which they're favored to do, the January 6 committee as it's currently constructed will cease to exist -- giving the panel less than three months to issue a final report of its findings. Still, the subpoena marks a notable escalation in taking on Trump directly. While it's not unprecedented, congressional subpoenas to sitting or former presidents are rare. And if Trump does buck the subpoena, it would allow the committee to proclaim that it made a formal attempt to get Trump to talk to panelists, only to see him to refuse. Panel airs new footage of congressional leaders scrambling to respond from Fort McNair The committee aired previously unseen footage from Fort McNair, the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection and scrambled to respond to the unfolding crisis. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said during the hearing that the footage highlights how Trump administration officials and congressional leaders worked around Trump to put down the riot that he had incited. By showing these behind-the-scenes clips, the committee delivered on its promise to present new material from January 6 to the public. The footage shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top officials working the phones and coordinating with Trump Cabinet members and other officials to secure the resources needed to quell the insurrection and secure the Capitol. The footage also showed two phone calls between Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role on January 6, coordinating the emergency response. The new footage showed Schumer dressing down then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. During their heated phone call, Schumer implored Rosen to intervene directly with Trump, and tell Trump to call off the mob. During the call, Pelosi told Rosen that the pro-Trump rioters were \"breaking the law... at the instigation of the President of the United States.\" During the hearing, the panel labeled the footage as showing lawmakers at an \"undisclosed location.\" It has been public knowledge since January 6, 2021, that senior congressional leaders from both parties took refuge at Fort McNair, while the Capitol was overrun. CNN has obtained additional footage from Fort McNair that wasn't shown by the committee. The exclusive footage will air on CNN on Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET, during a special edition of \"Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.\" The footage shows congressional leaders, after evacuating from the Capitol, gathering at Fort McNair working the phones, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help as they frantically scrambled to quell the insurrection. Public hears from Elaine Chao interview  Elaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump's secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified to the committee.  \"I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking and it was something that, as I mentioned in my statement, that I could not put aside,\" said Chao, one of the former members of Trump's Cabinet whose recorded testimony lawmakers aired on Thursday. \"And at a particular point, the events were such that it was impossible for me to continue, given my personal values and my philosophy. I came as an immigrant to this country. I believe in this country. I believe in the peaceful transfer of power. I believe in democracy. And so I was -- it was a decision that I made on my own,\" she said. CNN reported in August that Chao, who is also the wife of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, had met with the committee. But after condemning the attack in her resignation letter in early 2021, Chao has largely stayed out of the national spotlight, with her recent comments to the committee providing fresh insight into her thinking on the deadly attack. Hutchinson says Trump knew he lost Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election. Hutchinson's testimony had been some of the most damning against Trump during the summer hearings, as she provided detailed accounts about Trump's actions on the day of January 6. On Thursday, the committee showed new video deposition from Hutchinson where she spoke to Meadows about Trump's January 2021 call where he urged the Georgia secretary of state to \"find\" the votes he needed to win. \"I remember looking at Mark, and I said 'Mark, he can't possibly think we're going to pull this off. Like, that call was crazy.' And he looked at me and just started shaking his head. And he's like, 'No, Cass, you know, he knows it's over. He knows he lost. But we're going to keep trying,'\" Hutchinson told the committee. Hutchinson also said that she witnessed a conversation between Meadows and Trump where he was furious the Supreme Court had rejected a lawsuit seeking to overturn the election result. \"The President said ... something to the effect of, 'I don't want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. Figure it out. We need to figure it out. I don't want people to know that we lost,'\" Hutchinson said. Committee reveals new info obtained from Secret Service In roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing, the panel has obtained more than 1 million records from the Secret Service, and the panel revealed some of what they learned during Thursday's hearing. While there are still questions surrounding erased text messages from Secret Service agents around the insurrection, the panel obtained messages and emails showing the agency receiving warnings before January 6, 2021, about the prospect of violence, as well as real-time reports of weapons in the crowd ahead of Trump's speech at the Ellipse. Days before January Trump's communication adviser, Jason Miller, boasted to Meadows that he \"got the base FIRED UP,\" and shared a link to a pro-Trump webpage containing hundreds of threatening comments about killing lawmakers if they went ahead with certifying Joe Biden's legitimate electoral victory, according to a new text message the panel showed Thursday. \"I got the base FIRED UP,\" Miller texted Meadows on December 30, 2020, appearing to take credit for amplifying the violent rhetoric about January 6 that was circulating on the pro-Trump website The Donald dot win. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said in Thursday's hearing that that the Secret Service received alerts of online threats made against Vice President Mike Pence ahead of the Capitol insurrection, including that Pence would be \"'a dead man walking if he doesn't do the right thing.'\"  On January 6, one Secret Service agent texted at 12:36 p.m., according to the committee, \"With so many weapons found so far; you wonder how many are unknown. Could be sporty after dark.\" Another agent responded minutes later, \"No doubt. The people at the Ellipse said they are moving to the Capitol after the POTUS speech.\" Trump planned to declare victory no matter what the election results were The committee also revealed new evidence Thursday that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were. \"It was a premeditated plan by the President to declare victory no matter what the actual result was,\" committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said during Thursday's hearing. \"We also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump's former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election, even if he lost,\" she added.  The committee played previously unseen video from its deposition of Pence's counsel, Greg Jacob. In the clip, Jacob describes how he and Pence's then-chief of staff Marc Short had prepared, ahead of time, for Trump to declare victory on Election Night, regardless of the results. After their conversation on November 3, 2020, Jacob drafted a memo to Short, which the committee said it obtained from the National Archives and presented for the first time on Thursday.  \"It is essential that the Vice President not be perceived by the public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts,\" the memo reads. The committee also revealed new emails conservative legal activist Tom Fitton sent to two Trump advisers a few days before the election. One email contains a draft statement for Trump to declare victory on Election Night.  Noticeably absent One person whose testimony was noticeably absent from Thursday's hearing was Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Committee members interviewed Ginni Thomas last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel's last hearing before the midterm election. Despite saying for months that they wanted to hear from "

  "text": "The January 6 committee returns to public view Thursday with its first hearing since July -- a sort of closing argument on its work, arguing that former President Donald Trump remains a threat to democracy. Committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren promised Tuesday on CNN the hearing will feature \"pretty surprising\" new information. Read CNN's full preview.  So much has happened since the last committee hearing -- particularly the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago, which reinserted Trump into the news. The committee has continued with interviews, including with members of Trump's cabinet and Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. While the committee may focus on how Trump's rhetoric before January 6, 2021, helped incite the insurrection, there are troubling indications that post-insurrection rhetoric from Trump along with that of far-right groups online has helped spur an increase in talk of violence. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has a forthcoming TV report on the rhetoric and how it has evolved since January 6. I asked him more about his reporting; our conversation, conducted over email, is below. Is there a direct line from violent rhetoric to Trump? WHAT MATTERS: How can we tie Trump's rhetoric to talk about violence online? What is the evidence? O'SULLIVAN: Just look at all the January 6th defendants who have argued in court that they went to the Capitol that day because they thought that's what Trump wanted them to do.  While Trump makes headlines when his rhetoric appears more blatant than suggestive (recently saying Mitch McConnell has a \"death wish\"), it's more his regular drumbeat of lies about the election that is giving some Americans a perceived justification for violence. American democracy is under attack, they believe, and something must be done about it. What's changed since the insurrection? WHAT MATTERS: How has this chatter changed since January 6?  O'SULLIVAN: There's been a great dispersal of online discussion since January 6th, with many figures on the right, even Trump himself, forced off major social media platforms, prompting a cottage industry of new services like Trump's own Truth Social. As a result, it is difficult to quantitatively measure discussion topics, but the many experts I have spoken to agree there has been a steady level of discussion about political violence (and to a lesser extent specifically civil war) since January 6th -- with a big spike being observed around the Mar-a-Lago FBI search. Is the movement growing? WHAT MATTERS: Is there reason to think this is a growing movement or one that is being marginalized? O'SULLIVAN: Influential Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene perpetuate the notion that the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago is essentially the beginning of a civil war; she also recently has been pushing the false claim that Democrats are killing Republicans.  We spoke to Barbara Walter, a professor at UC San Diego, who has studied civil conflicts around the world, for this story. She explained how there is a not insignificant number of Americans (many White, Christian males) who see the demographics of the country changing and are getting worried. Rhetoric like this from Greene, I think, can only exacerbate those fears. Where is this happening? WHAT MATTERS: Has this talk completely splintered to fringe platforms like Trump's Truth Social, or is it still on Twitter and Facebook? O'SULLIVAN: The false idea the 2020 election was stolen still widely circulates across the main platforms. But we have seen new communities devoted to QAnon conspiracy theories and election lies, some with hundreds of thousands of members, spring up on platforms like Truth Social, Telegram, Gab and Parler.   These are platforms that position themselves as bastions of free speech and can have very little moderation -- often that results in hateful and violent rhetoric circulating more freely than it would on the Big Tech sites. Yes, these people are talking about civil war WHAT MATTERS: When these people post about civil war, are they actually thinking there will be a war between Americans? O'SULLIVAN: Yes. In the mind of many of the people I speak to and many of the people we see on these sites, the \"other side\" is the true enemy. They have stolen an election; they have destroyed American democracy -- they have to be defeated to save America. When does rhetoric become violence? WHAT MATTERS: We prize freedom of speech in this country. What's the evidence this violent rhetoric turns into violence? O'SULLIVAN: I spent time with Greg Ehrie from the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) reading through some of the violent comments online for this story. Ehrie is a law enforcement veteran, a former FBI special agent.  As we were going through these anonymous comments online I remarked to him that I would never have done a story like this a few years ago -- crazy, anonymous comments on the internet, who cares? But January 6th changed that. We've seen how some of those who attacked the Capitol posted online not only in the lead-up to the attack, but during the attack itself. Social media is a critical space to them. The nonprofit group Advance Democracy even identified one anonymous poster who asked about a second American civil war in light of the Mar-a-Lago raid as a January 6th defendant. Of course, not all keyboard warriors go on and commit violent acts (or leave their basements), but I don't think we are any longer in a position to ignore what is happening in these spaces, unfortunately. What is the new conspiracy theory? WHAT MATTERS: January 6 was marked by wild ideas that Trump would mobilize the military, declare martial law and refuse to leave the White House. What is the conspiracy theory now? O'SULLIVAN: There's a lot of focus now on getting people sympathetic to election lies in positions that would have them oversee elections as a way of remedying the perceived problems with American democracy. What should be done? WHAT MATTERS: The people who are studying and following this movement online -- what do they think should be done? Marginalize it? Shine a light on it? O'SULLIVAN: I asked Barbara Walter if we were giving oxygen to this by even talking about it -- she said no. Speaking to people who have lived through conflicts from Belfast to Baghdad, she said, few of them saw it was coming until they were in the middle of it. .... I'd also add Walter doesn't think another civil conflict here would take the form of the battlegrounds of old, but instead likely be guerrilla warfare with attacks on government buildings and officials. WHAT MATTERS: For a closing follow-up on that point Walter made to O'Sullivan, look at some recent examples of the government being targeted. Following the Mar-a-Lago search in August, an armed suspect was killed after trying to breach the FBI's field office in Cincinnati, and there were convictions in the 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer."

  "title": "Secret recording played at trial shows Oath Keepers allegedly planning for violence in DC",
  "date": "2022-10-05T04:10:14Z",
  "text": "Federal prosecutors played audio recording in court on Tuesday of an alleged November 2020 Oath Keepers planning meeting that discussed plans to bring weapons to Washington, DC, and prepare to \"fight\" on behalf of former President Donald Trump.  The meeting lasted about two hours and was secretly recorded by an attendee, FBI agent Michael Palian told jurors during the second day of the trial of far-right militia Oath Keepers leaders on seditious conspiracy charges. The attendee, Palian said, sent a tip to the FBI later that month but was not contacted by agents. They then resubmitted the tip in March 2021, was interviewed with agents and gave them the recording. The recording, which is primarily of Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, is the first major piece of evidence that prosecutors have used to establish a plan by the far-right group to allegedly descend on Washington and oppose the transfer of power. \"We're not getting out of this without a fight. There's going to be a fight,\" Rhodes said in the recording played in court. \"But let's just do it smart and let's do it while President Trump is still commander in chief,\" Rhodes said. Rhodes repeatedly said that people should put pressure on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, and that the Oath Keepers would be \"awaiting the president's orders.\" \"If the fight comes, let the fight come. Let Antifa go -- if they go kinetic on us then we'll go kinetic back on them. I'm willing to sacrifice myself for that,\" Rhodes said in the recording. \"If things go kinetic, good. If they blow bombs up and shoot us, great. Because that brings the President reason and rationale\" to invoke the Insurrection Act. He continued, \"so our mission going to be to go into DC, but I do want some Oath Keepers to stay on the outside and to stay fully armed and prepared to go in if they have to. So, if the s**t kicks off, then you rock and roll.\"  Two other defendants, Jessica Watkins and Kelly Meggs, are also on the recording discussing what weapons are legal to bring into the district, prosecutors said. \"Pepper spray is legal. Tasers are legal. And stun guns are legal. And it doesn't hurt to have a lead pipe with a flag on it,\" Meggs said on the recording.  After the meeting, Meggs and Watkins both told their state Oath Keeper delegations that they were going to go to Washington. Watkins wrote to Ohio members, \"Anybody not on the call tonight. We have been issued a call to action for DC. This is the moment we signed up for.\" All five defendants have pleaded not guilty to the seditious conspiracy charge they face, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years behind bars. CNN national security analyst Carrie Cordero said Congress should look at how the FBI handled the initial tip about the Oath Keepers tape.  That the Oath Keepers recording went uninvestigated by the FBI until after January 6 is an \"additional piece of information that congressional investigators in particular on the January 6th committee and the other Homeland Security committees should be looking at to determine whether or not the FBI and other law enforcement organizations were doing enough on the prevention side,\" Cordero told CNN's Ana Cabrera on Tuesday.  Cordero said that \"lots of information that has come to light over the course of the last year that indicates there were all sorts of other indications that there would be violence on January 6th raises the question of why there wasn't better warning in advance to those who were responsible for protecting the physical security of the Capitol.\" During cross examination, attorneys for the defendants questioned Palian on the context of the recording. \"Isn't it true that all of the talk that Mr. Rhodes and others are doing ... is related to going to DC on November 14th?\" Rhodes' attorney Phillip Linder asked Palian, referencing the so-called Million MAGA March that took place in Washington in November 2020. \"I'd agree with that,\" Palian responded. Prosecutors have previously said that some of the defendants, including Rhodes, Watkins and Thomas Caldwell attended the November march without incident. Palian also testified that the recording did not mention the date January 6. David Fischer, an attorney for Caldwell, asked Palian whether Caldwell explicitly stated that he was planning to attack the Capitol. Palian testified that \"We have not come across a person that has told us that.\" Fischer pushed Palian on whether Caldwell was actually a member of the Oath Keepers, but Palian testified that he was \"part of the group\" even if he didn't formally pay dues. \"It costs zero dollars to join a gang,\" Palian testified. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments from Tuesday's court proceedings."

  "text": "With the historic case that they had brought against Oath Keepers accused of plotting to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, prosecutors framed up how the jury should think about the allegations with an hour-plus opening statement that kicked off the trial in earnest.  Five alleged members of the far-right militia, including its leader Stewart Rhodes, are on trial in Washington DC's federal courthouse. They have pleaded not guilty to the charge of seditious conspiracy, a charge rarely brought by the Justice Department, and other charges.  The Justice Department's opening statement featured messages and other communications among the defendants that prosecutors say show the Oath Keepers' unlawful plotting to disrupt Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's electoral win. As the prosecutors sought to use the words of the defendants against them, they also played video capturing the Oath Keepers' actions in the Capitol and displayed maps and charts to help the jury follow along. Each juror has their own screen to see evidence. \"They said out loud and in writing what they planned to do,\" Jeffrey Nestler, an assistant US Attorney, told the jury. \"When the opportunity finally presented itself ... they sprang into action.\"  A lawyer for Rhodes, the first defense attorney to deliver an opening statement told the jurors that they will see evidence that will show that the defendants \"had no part in the bulk\" of the violence that occurred on January 6.  \"You may not like what you see and hear our defendants did,\" attorney Phillip Linder said, \"but the evidence will show that they didn't do anything illegal that day.\" Here are takeaways from Monday's trial so far:  DOJ says defendants \"concocted a plan for an armed rebellion\"  The Justice Department began its opening statement with the accusation that the defendants sought to \"stop by any means necessary\" the lawful transfer of presidential power, \"including taking up arms against the United States government.\"  Nestler started with a reference to the \"core democratic custom of the routine\" transfer of power, which Nestler said stretched back to the time of George Washington.  \"These defendants tried to change that history. They concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy,\" Nestler said.   The defendants got their opportunity two weeks before the Inauguration, Nestler said.  \"If Congress could not meet it could not declare the winner of the election. and that was their goal -- to stop by any means necessary the lawful transfer of power, including taking up arms against the United States government,\" he said.   He said the defendants descended on DC to attack \"not just the Capitol, not just our government, not just DC, but our country itself.\"  Prosecutors use January 6 video footage During the Justice Department's opening, the jury was presented with video footage, maps and other audio-visual tools that prosecutors used to give an overview of their case.  Nestler's presentation included iPhone footage from the attack that the prosecutor used to identify the defendants and other alleged co-conspirators. When video showing defendant Kelly Meggs was presented, Nestler noted the patch he wore, which said, according to Nestler: \"I don't believe in anything, I'm just here for the violence.\"  As the video clips played, the jury also saw a map of the Capitol that Nestler used to situate the action that was recorded by video. Nestler also had a physical chart, perched on an easel in the courtroom, listing out the alleged co-conspirators.   Jurors were also presented with the messages that the defendants allegedly sent in the weeks after the election, including their calls for a violent response to former President Donald Trump's loss.  \"Its easy to chat here. The real question is who's willing to DIE\" Meggs wrote in one message shown by prosecutors.    The DOJ also showed video and photographs of the Oath Keepers participating in tactical training sessions. A map of the Washington Mall -- showing the site of the rally that preceded the Capitol attack and its distance from the Capitol -- was presented while Nestler ticked through communications, including on the walkie talk app Zello, between the defendants that allegedly occurred that day.  Prosecutors preemptively punch holes in Oath Keepers' defense  Nestler used the opening arguments to also preview how the Justice Department will respond to defenses the Oath Keepers' attorneys are expected to put forward.  \"There is evidence that you will hear that they had more than one reason to be here in DC, in addition to attacking Congress,\" the prosecutor said. The defendants may have been planning to attend the rally near the White House earlier in the day, Nestler noted, but so did thousands of others. Nestler also referenced to potential attempts by the defense to argue the Oath Keepers were preparing to come to DC to serve as security, noting that the defendants weren't licensed, trained or paid for their security work.  \"Even being bad security guards isn't itself illegal.\" Nestler said. However, according to the prosecutor, the goal they were actually preparing for was \"unlawful.\"  Additionally, Nestler alluded to the belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act; the defense has signaled it plans to argue that the Oath Keepers were preparing to respond to such an invocation.  \"President Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act,\" Nestler said. \"These defendants needed to take matters into their own hands. They needed to activate the plan they had agreed on.\"  The Justice Department also emphasized the backgrounds of some of the defendants and how that fit into the department's theory of the case. Rhodes, as Nestler repeatedly noted, is a graduate of Yale Law school. He knew to be careful with his words and told his co-conspirators to be careful with theirs, Nestler said.  Thomas Caldwell, another defendant, served in the military, Nestler said. \"Based on that water experience, he planned to use boats to get across the Potomac.\"  DOJ detail \"desperate\" focus on January 6 The Justice Department detailed the preparations the Oath Keepers allegedly undertook before January 6 as well as what they're accusing the defendants of doing during the Capitol breach. In December 2020, Rhodes told others that January 6 presented a \"hard constitutional deadline,\" according to prosecutors, and that they would need to \"do it ourselves\" if Trump didn't stop the certification of the election. \"With time, as their options dwindled and it became more and more likely that power would be transferred,\" Nestler said Monday, \"these defendants became more and more desperate and more and more focused on that date that Rhodes referred to as a constitutional deadline.\" According to Nestler, the group organized a caravan of Florida members to drive up to Washington for January 6, and made preparations for where the organization could store firearms in Virginia, just outside DC. Some members of the group, according to prosecutors, brought weapons into DC that day, including chemical spray, thick pieces of wood, dressed in paramilitary gear. Nestler's opening described the \"stack\" formations the defendants allegedly used to enter the Capitol. He played a video of defendant Jessica Watkins, who allegedly led the first group, pushing against a crowd outside the House chamber shouting \"push, push, push! Get in there, they can't hold us.\" The second group positioned themselves outside of a suite of offices belonging to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Nestler said. Nestler said that Meggs had a \"keen interest in Speaker Pelosi,\" and later told associates that \"we looked for her.\" At first, the defendants saw the breach as a success, Nestler said, describing them as \"elated,\" \"boastful\" and \"proud.\" But, according to DOJ's account, the defendants quickly realized they were in legal jeopardy, and instructed one another to flee town, delete messages and keep quiet. \"Let me put it in infantry speak: SHUT THE F**K UP,\" Rhodes said in one Signal message, as presented by prosecutors. Even with their criminal exposure, Nestler said, Rhodes continued to plot. On January 10, Rhodes met with someone in Texas to try and get a message to former President Trump. The meeting, which had not previously been reported, was secretly recorded by an attendee. \"My only regret is that they should have brought rifles... we could have fixed it right then and there.\" Rhodes said of January 6, according to the Justice Department's opening. Oath Keepers attorney: Defendants \"had no part in the bulk of\" January 6 violence  Rhodes attorney Linder told the jurors that they will see evidence that will show that defendants \"had no part in the bulk\" of the violence that occurred on January 6.  He suggested that there will be gaps in the evidence, such as video, that the Justice Department will show the jury. He said that, once the prosecutors put on their case, the defense will fill in those gaps.  \"You may not like what you see and hear our defendants did, but the evidence will show that they didn't do anything illegal that day,\" Linder said. As the defense attorney delivered his opening, he was told by the judge to avoid topics that had been deemed out of bounds for the trial -- with at one point, Judge Amit Mehta bringing him up to the bench for a private discussion. Among the off-limits topics brought up by Linder that prompted the interventions were comments about the amount prison time the charges bring, the congressional narrative around January 6, remarks about defendants sitting in jail, and certain details about the Insurrection Act. Mehta told Linder to keep his opening within the parameters of the relevant subject matter that has been established before the trial.  Linder went on to preview other aspects of the Oath Keepers' defense. \"The real evidence is going to show you that our clients were there to do security for events for the 5th and the 6th,\" Linder said, while calling his client a \"extremely patriotic\" and a \"constitutional expert.\" \"Stewart Rhodes meant no harm to the Capitol that day,\" Linder said, as he described some of the rhetoric among the defendants \"free speech and bravado.\" The attorney said that the evidence will show that there was no plan like the one that the Justice Department is alleging. Linder said that Rhodes is planning to testify in his own defense to explain what he believed would happen on January 6. At least one cooperating Oath Keeper, William Todd Wilson, is also scheduled to testify during the trial, Linder said Monday. Linder said that he intends to ask Wilson about his plea agreement, including an allegation that Wilson witnessed Rhodes attempt to contact Trump on the evening of January 6. Linder suggested that allegation, which was sworn in Wilson's plea agreement, was untrue. Specific DOJ accusa"

  "title": "Virginia's 2nd district: Candidates spar over abortion, rising costs in one of the nation's most competitive House races",
  "date": "2022-10-03T13:30:17Z",
  "text": "Helen Anoia puts gas in her truck but does not fill up the tank. \"I'm only going to get a few cents right now,\" she said, explaining that she has a dollar-off coupon that she's waiting to use. \"I'll be able to have a little bit more savings by the end of the month,\" she said. \"The prices are outrageous.\" Anoia is one of many voters here in Virginia Beach who are feeling financially squeezed by inflation and the higher gas costs. She's undecided about how she will vote in this critical midterm election but says that she's exhausted by life's challenges right now. \"I just want to be able to feel like I don't have to think about every little detail,\" she said as she monitored the numbers rapidly flipping upward on the gas pump beside her. It is this kind of discontent that Republicans are banking on to help them flip the House in November, and Virginia's 2nd Congressional District is one of their biggest targets. Incumbent Democrat Elaine Luria was a so-called majority maker in 2018. She turned what was a red district blue, giving Democrats control of the House. Now, the two-term Democrat is trying to hold on to her seat, not just for her own viability but for that of her party and its agenda in Washington. \"If you look across the spectrum of the country, this is number 218, statistically,\" Luria told CNN, meaning that she sees her seat as the one likely to decide which party has 218 votes -- the minimum number needed for majority control of the 435-member House of Representatives. During an interview at her campaign office in Suffolk, Luria brushed off the pressure that comes with being a candidate in such a key House race. \"I spent 20 years in the Navy,\" she quipped. \"I'm used to the pressure.\" Luria is a retired naval commander who served on six warships as a nuclear trained surface warfare officer. This year, her Republican challenger, state Sen. Jen Kiggans, is also a Navy veteran. Kiggans was a helicopter pilot in the Navy and is now a nurse. The two women are competing for a seat in the commonwealth's Tidewater area that has swung between parties four times since 2000 -- a rare remaining political battleground in a largely gerrymandered House where most district lines are drawn to protect seats of both parties. In Kiggans' paid ads, her main focus is economic issues, showing herself putting groceries in her car and lamenting the high cost of food. Those concerns were echoed by Virginia Beach voter Jason Feteke outside a grocery store as he recently pushed a cart full of food for his family.  \"This was $127. A year and a half ago, it would've been $75, $80,\" he said, gesturing to his cart. \"The price of groceries, the price of gas, the price of everything that's going up.\" Feteke said he is fiercely independent politically. He has voted for both Democrats and Republicans, but this November he intends to support the GOP. \"I'm going to vote for Kiggans. She's the most likely to make changes. Right now, Elaine Luria is just voting with everybody else for the Inflation Reduction Act, which doesn't reduce inflation. Since she's not really concerned about my family and what we're trying to do, it's a no brainer, it's not even close right now,\" Feteke said. But not all voters in this battleground district blame Democrats for high prices. Across the parking lot, Ryan Farmer was quietly cursing the cost of the gas he was putting in his car but said he will still vote for Luria. \"I don't care who's president. Gas prices are going to be expensive. It is what it is right now,\" he told CNN. \"I don't think that anyone who goes out and says, 'Oh, this is because of whoever's in charge,' I don't think that's just true.\" Early voting is underway On the first day of early voting in Virginia, Luria campaigned in a conservative area in Suffolk. Supporters were waiting outside the polling place to meet the congresswoman. \"I'm going to put this sign in my yard,\" one voter told her. \"First time I've put a sign out.\" The Kiggans campaign declined to share information with CNN about any events with voters. She's been communicating with voters via paid advertisements and videos on social media. Her campaign declined a request for an interview with the candidate but did suggest a surrogate -- Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares -- who blamed Democrats' policies in Washington for Virginians' economic woes. \"She's voted with (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi over 98% of the time, and so much of this is being driven by the spending in Washington,\" Miyares, a Republican, said about Luria. \"We know Washington has a spending problem. They're spending too much money. They flooded too much money into our economy, and now everything is costing more.\" Luria said in an interview that she understands that \"this is very difficult for people.\" \"Prices have gone up. Gas prices were very high, and they're coming down rapidly now, so I understand that's been a big strain on people in the community. And the policies we voted on are things that are meant to help people, such as cutting prescription drug costs,\" she said.  \"When I first ran, that was one of the things that I was talking about. It was important to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs, to cap the price of drugs for seniors, to cap the price of insulin, and we passed legislation like that. It's been signed into law by the President.\" But she also walks the finest of lines when asked about President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have gone up in recent weeks but are still relatively low. \"As far as the President's agenda, I don't support everything. I honestly think that he's not doing enough for defense. That's the reason that I basically criticized the budget that was going to shrink the size of the Navy,\" Luria said. January 6th Committee Luria is one of nine members of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. She admits that when she was first appointed, she worried it could hurt her at home politically. But, she said, it turns out that when people come up to talk to her in her district, \"90%\" of the time it is to thank her for her work on the January 6 insurrection probe. \"People really do understand what a threat this is to our democracy. ... My opponent is somebody who won't say Joe Biden won the election -- she's like, 'Well, he lives in the White House, but I wish he didn't,'\" Luria said. Luria also points out that in the state Senate, Kiggans was one of four Republicans who voted to approve $70 million to audit the 2020 election in Virginia. \"Joe Biden won the election,\" said Miyares, the Virginia attorney general and Kiggans campaign surrogate. \"I knew a lot of voters personally that voted Republicans for Congress and other offices, but voted for a change in the White House.\"  When asked about Kiggans' position, Miyares said: \"Every time I've ever talked to Jen, she thinks Joe Biden won the election as President.\" But the 2020 election is over, and voters are now focusing on \"spending in Washington and the fact there's no check and balance,\" he added. To be sure, it's not as if \"election integrity\" as a political issue has gone away among Virginia Republicans. In fact, Miyares recently announced an Election Integrity Unit in the commonwealth that opponents have criticized as unnecessary and a drain on resources from other state agencies. \"One of our roles is we both advise state agencies, including the Department of Elections. The other, we have original jurisdiction on enforcing violations of election law. I wanted everybody to be on the same sheet of music, and I think it's an important role,\" Miyares said. \"It's one role of many that we carry in our office, but we already have existing election laws, so no new lawyers. It's people already in our office all being basically in the same division.\" Abortion Like other Democrats in tough races across the country, Luria is hoping that outrage over the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade will help drive her voters to the polls. Much of her well-funded campaign has been focused on paid advertisements that point out that Kiggans applauded Roe's reversal and argue that Kiggans' anti-abortion views would put women's health in danger. That prompted Kiggans to release a carefully scripted video through social media insisting that she does support abortion in the cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. Luria said flatly that Kiggins \"couldn't tell you what the hell she believes.\" \"I mean, she goes back and forth. She's unapologetically pro-life. She'll say, 'life begins at conception,'\" Luria said. \"You know, I don't believe anything this woman says. She, in my mind, has no spine. She really just says whatever she thinks she needs to say to get elected, and that changes every other week.\"\nMiyares said Kiggans has indicated she would support a 15-week ban. \"Most of Europe has some levels of abortion limits after 12 weeks,\" he said. \"That's very different than her opponent's position, which is abortion anytime, anywhere, for any reason up until the moment of birth, paid for by taxpayers.\" When asked if she supports any restrictions on abortion, Luria said she supports the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established a federal constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability. Luria voted twice in the House to codify the Roe decision into law. Extremist Whether it is abortion rights or the 2020 election, Luria's main argument against her GOP opponent has been that Kiggans is an extremist whose policy positions are not representative of a swing district. That prompted Kiggans to release an ad pushing back, announcing straight to camera that she's been called a lot of things, but \"extremist? That's a new one.\" Kiggans is leaning hard into the fact that she is a geriatric nurse and mom -- relatable parts of her resume. Whether Kiggans can pull that off, and whether she can ride the anti-Washington sentiment that is traditionally a factor in a president's first midterm election, will help determine which party controls Congress next year.

  "title": "Biden goes after House GOP's 'thin' midterm agenda",
  "date": "2022-09-23T19:17:30Z",
  "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday criticized Republicans and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy's proposed midterm agenda, describing the plan as a \"thin series of policy goals\" in his latest campaign speech. Biden's speech is part of a broader, ramped up effort by the President and the Democratic Party to capitalize on recent political wins and illustrate their differences with Republicans ahead of the November midterm elections. The President's remarks came within hours of McCarthy's event in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, where he unveiled the House GOP platform, dubbed the \"Commitment to America.\"  \"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went to Pennsylvania and unveiled what he calls a 'Commitment to America.' Now that's a thin series of policy goals with little or no detail that he says Republicans are going to pursue if they regain control of the Congress,\" Biden told a packed auditorium on Friday at a Democratic National Committee event at the National Education Association's headquarters in Washington.  He added: \"In the course of nearly an hour, here's a few of the things we didn't hear: We didn't hear him mention the right to choose, we didn't hear him mention Medicare, we didn't hear him mention Social Security.\" McCarthy's plan focused on four main planks -- the economy, crime and border security, education and government accountability. There is also a nod to the culture wars, with Republicans vowing to ensure \"only women can compete in women's sports.\" But the document is generally light on specific policy details, making vague promises like protecting \"the lives of unborn children and their mothers,\" without articulating how they plan to do so.  During his remarks on Friday, the President touted policy wins since he took office, as well as promised to codify Roe v. Wade, protect Social Security and pass an assault weapons ban -- if the Democrats keep control of Congress. Biden specifically called out Republicans for supporting the false claim that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election -- which he argued has become a litmus test to \"pledge loyalty to Donald Trump.\" The President said that while not all Republicans are \"MAGA Republicans,\" it's \"self-evident\" that \"MAGA Republicans\" control the party. He also criticized Republicans who have failed to condemn the insurrection and called out GOP members for supporting calls to defund the FBI.  \"Don't tell me you support law enforcement if you can't condemn what happened on January the 6th,\" Biden said, referring to the riot at the Capitol in 2021, adding: \"You can't be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can't claim to be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 patriots.\"  The President railed against Republicans' attempts to ban abortions, the GOP's past tax cuts -- which he argued \"benefited the top 1%\" and the party's opposition to efforts he said would make communities safer. Democrats have seized on a proposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, that would implement a federal ban abortion in most cases at 15 weeks of pregnancy. And in Friday's speech, Biden specifically leaned into criticizing Republican attempts to restrict abortion access -- despite it being an issue he had previously been wary of discussing at length publicly. \"In 46 days, America is going to choose,\" the President said. \"If Republicans win control (of) the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned. But if they win Congress, I will veto it.\"  The White House continues to target Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott's proposed GOP agenda, which includes a requirement that federal legislation would sunset every five years unless reauthorized by Congress. Biden on Friday criticized the House GOP's \"longer, healthier lives for Americans\" goal, saying it \"sounds great\" but argued that it isn't what the GOP stands for.   \"Already, 158 House Republicans have signed onto Republican budget that will cut Medicare and Social Security,\" Biden said.   Biden's speech on Friday was a part of a flurry of political appearances in the remaining weeks leading up to the midterms. Democrats hope a string of legislative victories and outcry from their base in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to strike down Roe v. Wade have added momentum to their candidates. Earlier this week while in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, Biden attended multiple political fundraisers. Next Tuesday, the President is scheduled to attend a DNC rally in Florida.

  "title": "Marcy Kaptur's competitive race in Ohio's 9th speaks volumes about the Democratic Party's place in the Rust Belt",
  "date": "2022-09-21T15:40:39Z",
  "text": "It was not yet 5 p.m. on a Thursday, but the 818 Club restaurant was already packed as Rep. Marcy Kaptur walked around, greeting locals and introducing herself. For a congresswoman in office for nearly 40 years, you would think she would know more patrons in this popular restaurant. But this business is in a new part of her northern Ohio district, which changed dramatically after the latest round of redistricting, and whether Kaptur has served long enough is one of the most hotly debated questions among potential voters. With Democrats holding a razor thin majority in the House, Kaptur's race will help determine whether her party will keep control or face steep losses in November's midterm elections. And even here, where economic struggles are deeply rooted, voters say they will have another issue on their mind as they go to the polls this year -- abortion. Previously, Ohio's 9th District was so safely Democrat that even though President Joe Biden lost the state in 2020, he carried the district -- which stretched along the coast of Lake Erie from Cleveland to Toledo -- by more than 15 points. Kaptur herself easily won reelection that year. But redistricting shifted the lines, encompassing counties in the northwest part of the state, stretching to the Indiana border - creating a much more conservative 9th district that Donald Trump would have won-- and making Kaptur's 19th run for office much more competitive. Not since redistricting forced her into a primary against fellow incumbent Dennis Kucinich in 2012 has Kaptur faced such odds. \"A lot of shoe leather, a lot of personal visits, a lot of public events,\" Kaptur told CNN in an interview between events doing just that. The race also features another dynamic with national implications: Kaptur's Republican opponent, J.R. Majewski, is an election denier who was at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. He has said he went to protest peacefully and left when \"it got ugly.\" The contest is a head-on collision between a long-time Rust Belt Democrat and an unabashed Trump Republican.  A midwestern Democrat Being a brand name in northern Ohio helps Kaptur a lot. She's been a recognizable and present figure here for four decades.  But she says being a midwestern Democrat in a party increasingly run with big city sensibilities on both coasts is a growing challenge for her. \"What coastal people, God bless them, don't understand, is that we lost our middle class,\" Kaptur said.  \"We lost so many people who've worked hard all their lives, including in many of these small towns. I understand that. We feel their pain. We went through it together.\" Kaptur is relying on voters like Joe Stallbaum, a member of the sheet metal workers Local 33 Toledo district, a union that endorsed both Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and Kaptur this year.  Stallbaum has been working on a massive renovation of Toledo's convention center for nearly two years and says helping revitalize his hometown fills him with pride. But he also says a lot of his friends and colleagues still feel forgotten. \"I think there should be a lot more focus on working class people and what we do,\" he explained. \"It just seems like we always get left behind.\" A second-generation construction worker, Stallbaum says he watched a lot of his fellow union members abandon the Democratic Party in favor of Trump in 2016 and other Republicans since then. With union households making up close to 20% of the vote, it helps explain Democrats' struggles in Ohio and other parts of the Rust Belt. But Stallbaum believes that Kaptur is different than the national Democratic Party -- she's someone who appreciates and understands blue collar workers. \"I always felt that Marcy listened to working class people. That's one of the things I like about her. I think she's very approachable. She doesn't seem distant to me. I feel I could have reached out to her anytime I had wanted to.\" A longtime Kaptur supporter, he plans to vote for her again.  \"She's never given me a reason not to support her. Everything she's always done is for Toledo and for our region,\" he said. \"I trust her.\" Support for Trump remains But that kind of support for Kaptur is harder to find in the new, conservative parts of the district -- especially at Bud's Restaurant in Defiance, Ohio, where the coffee is always hot and the conversation is always lively - especially early in the mornings when a regular group of men fill the booths.  CNN asked the seven men stretching across two tables if anyone planned to vote for Kaptur. Only one said yes. Trump won Defiance County by more than 35 points in 2020. He endorsed Kaptur's challenger Majewski in June.  For Joe Clements, Trump's endorsement alone is enough.  \"It means a lot. I like Trump,\" he said. But that's controversial, even here. \"The man wants to be a dictator,\" said Steve Santo, the lone Kaptur supporter at the table. \"You don't understand that. He tried to overthrow our government. And that's the bottom line and you guys can't see it. I'm sorry. That's what happened on January 6. You can't tell me any different.\" Majewski's presence at the Capitol on the day of the insurrection is a deal breaker for Santo. \"I would never vote for him. For any of those people who were there on January 6th. They actually tried to overtake our government.\" His friend Scott Brown disagreed. \"I think there were a lot of people who were there that didn't go in - just were there to be part of it. So I don't think that would influence my vote against him.\" Brown, now retired, says his party allegiance has changed in recent years. \"I always considered myself a Democrat. Since the way Democrats have been coming down on everything, I changed my feelings about that, and now I have signed up to be a Republican.\"  Terry Howarth was also down on Democrats in Washington. \"Biden's got this country - you know Afghanistan, the border, inflation, this student loan thing.\" he said, pausing on his list of grievances with the Biden administration to emphasize how upset he is about the president's plan for student loan forgiveness. \"I paid for my kids' education, I paid for my own education. If you go to college, you expect the guy who's like who just barely get by here. Expect them to pay for somebody's college education?\" Still, not all voters at Bud's are sold on Majewski, an Air Force veteran who became known in this area for turning his lawn into a 19,000-foot Trump 2020 sign. CNN's KFILE unearthed evidence Majewski repeatedly promoted QAnon conspiracies,  though he's since denied being a follower. He's also spread the baseless theory that the January 6 attack was \"driven by the F.B.I. and it was a stage show.\" Seth Peters, a Republican, hasn't decided who he's going to vote for, because he doesn't know enough about Majewski's platform. \"I want to see how he would improve the area. How he would do in Congress, what his plans are. Because I'm 30, almost 31, my wife and I are probably going to have kids and what are they going to do for our kids, for our grandkids, our future?\" Peters asked. Through a spokesman, Majewski declined CNN's request for an interview to answer such questions, or provide any information about public events where he might be explaining his positions. The abortion issue prevails Even amidst a struggling economy, many of the voters CNN talked to across the district said abortion was a top concern. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, many voters have become energized by the issue that was once considered settled law.  In Toledo, Stallbaum, the union member and sheet metal worker, said women's rights was the number one issue driving his vote. \"I may not agree with it, somebody else may not agree with it. That doesn't matter to me,\" he said of abortion. \"What matters to me is that it's your decision to make. That person's, that woman's decision to make, nobody else's. And I think that was absolutely wrong to take that away. He attributes some of that to his union values. \"In the trades, it doesn't matter what your race, your religion, your political affiliation, your gender, we all get paid the same. Men and women side by side get paid exactly the same in hourly rate. Exactly the same in benefits. It should be like that across the board.\" Back at Bud's, Republican-leaning voter Terry Howarth is also concerned. \"I realize as a medic retired from the medical field, that to overturn Roe vs. Wade, there's gonna be a lot of women who die,\" he said, but also made clear the issue is not driving his vote and still intended to support Republicans here in November. Across the table from Howarth, Greg Steyer says it is his top issue. He's Catholic, firmly against abortion, and though his son once worked for Kaptur, he says he will vote against her because she supports abortion rights. \"Obviously the Democratic Party supports abortion. Probably the biggest question I have is, how [...] Catholic leadership can say that they are strong Catholics and still support abortion?\"  said Steyer. \"Greg and I disagree on the abortion issue,\" Howarth shot back. \"We need to do something to change that we're not having 700,000 abortions a year. But we cannot make it illegal.\" Following the Supreme Court striking down Roe, a law passed by the Ohio state legislature in 2019 went into effect, prohibiting abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That law was temporarily blocked last week, so abortions in the state currently can be obtained up to 20 weeks post-fertilization. Majewski has not been outspoken on the issue. Kaptur supports a woman's right to choose -- and told CNN that she hears about it from voters across the state. \"I had a young woman come up to me in Defiance, and she said, 'Marcy, if something happens, what am I supposed to do?' She was in tears,\" Kaptur said. She acknowledged that the right to an abortion is tenuous in her state. \"Ohio is a state where that 10-year-old girl, who was a victim of incest, was made to go out of state. Her adult relatives had to take her out of state to make a decision, a consequential decision,\" Kaptur said, referring to the young girl who traveled to Indiana earlier this year for an abortion. \"I think people want that decision to be made freely, within the confines of their own family, and they don't want politicians or Washington taking away their freedom.\" Poised to break another record Kaptur is currently the longest serving female member in the history of the House of Representatives. If she wins in November and is sworn in for a 20th term, she will break another record, surpassing former Sen. Barbara Mikulski as the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress.   That fact that she's been in office so long sparks strong feelings among voters, especially at Buds. \"If the guy from Toledo wins, we're back to base one agai"

  "title": "'Welcome to fascism': Top Arizona Republican blasts Trump-backed candidates who might try to overturn future elections",
  "date": "2022-09-18T12:04:38Z",
  "text": "The outgoing Republican speaker of the Arizona House says Trump-backed GOP candidates might send the country \"back into the dark ages\" if they win key midterm races and help enact laws to make it easier to overturn elections -- which he said was tantamount to \"fascism.\"  Rusty Bowers made the comments in an interview for an upcoming CNN special report by Jake Tapper, \"American Coup: The January 6th Investigation.\" The documentary, which details the major bombshells from Congress' exhaustive inquiry into the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, premieres on CNN on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. Bowers was a key witness at one of the public hearings this summer of the US House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Speaking about an unsuccessful Republican proposal to change how elections are run in Arizona, Bowers expressed alarm over provisions in the bill that would've created a pathway for the state legislature to cast aside the popular vote after an election and essentially anoint a winner. \"The legislature, after the election, could dismiss the election,\" Bowers said in describing the proposal that he ordered all 12 state House committees to consider, virtually ensuring it would never get a vote. \"And I said, welcome to fascism.\" Overturning or undermining election results is what former President Donald Trump pressured state officials to do in battleground states after he lost the 2020 election, including in Arizona, where Bowers was personally cajoled by Trump himself. Trump failed in his efforts to subvert the election results, but he and his allies have pushed for new voting laws in key states that give partisans more control over elections. Bowers' use of the \"fascism\" term is notable, considering the Republican backlash to President Joe Biden's recent remark that Trump's political movement resembles \"semi-fascism.\" Last month, Bowers lost a Republican primary for an Arizona state Senate seat. His opponent: former state Sen. David Farnsworth, who said that he had \"no doubt\" that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and that there was a \"conspiracy headed up by the devil himself.\" This helped earn him an endorsement from Trump, who posted online that \"Bowers must be defeated.\" Enough Arizona voters agreed, and Bowers lost by 30 points. Bowers admitted to CNN that he \"lost big,\" adding that the outcome doesn't bode well for democracy in the Grand Canyon State. \"It is very possible that the bill that I assigned liberally to my committees will be back\" if election deniers win in November, Bowers said. \"The possibility of that getting a governor signature would just be a disaster. I call it the possibility of going back into the dark ages in Arizona.\" The House January 6 committee is expected to resume its public hearings this month, and lawmakers are now also preparing their final report.  Bowers testified before the panel in June on Trump's pressure campaign to get the legislature to reject the Arizona election results. Bowers was formally censured by the Arizona Republican Party executive committee following his appearance.  The CNN documentary, \"American Coup: The January 6th Investigation,\" re-examines the major revelations from the committee's inquiry, through new interviews with key players and highlights from previous hearings. The major moments include the shocking testimony from former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson and admissions from Trump's inner circle that he knew he had lost. With the midterms looming, the Democratic-run select committee only has a few months before the GOP potentially retakes the House. If Republicans win back control of the chamber, they're expected to shut down the panel and to investigate the select committee itself."

  "title": "Family of fallen U.S. Marine re-files defamation lawsuit against Alec Baldwin in New York",
  "date": "2022-08-31T17:23:15Z",
  "text": "The family of fallen U.S. Marine Rylee J. McCollum has re-filed their lawsuit against actor Alec Baldwin for defamation in New York, according to a complaint filed Friday.   Rylee's widow, Jiennah McCollum, and Rylee's sisters, Roice McCollum and Cheyenne McCollum, are seeking $25 million in damages. They accuse Baldwin of making false allegations against the family, including allegedly calling Roice McCollum an \"insurrectionist\" in January 2022 after she posted a photo of a crowd of protesters in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 to social media.   \"While she was present at the [January 6th] demonstration, Roice did not take part in, nor did she support or condone the rioting that erupted,\" the lawsuit states. \"Baldwin plainly ignored Roice's denial of rioting and the assertion that she was cleared by the FBI for participating in any of the conduct Baldwin chose to falsely attribute to her via his massive following.\" The sisters and widow filed a similar lawsuit against Baldwin in Wyoming in January. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in May, finding that it did not have jurisdiction over Baldwin there since he lives in New York. At the time, Baldwin's attorney Luke Nikas, welcomed the decision. He said the lawsuit sought to \"punish Mr. Baldwin for expressing his political opinion.\" The re-filed lawsuit also claims that Baldwin's comments resulted in severe emotional distress for the plaintiffs. \"Mr. Baldwin donated several thousand dollars to Ms. McCollum to honor her husband, and now she's suing him for more because she disagrees with his political opinion about the insurrection that occurred on January 6th at the U.S. Capitol Building. We expect to prevail in this lawsuit, as we did the last time they filed it,\" Nikas told CNN Wednesday. Rylee McCollum, 20, was one of 13 U.S. service members who were killed in an attack outside the Kabul airport last August as the US and other Western countries raced to evacuate their citizens and allies out of Afghanistan. After Rylee's death, an online fundraiser was started on behalf of his widow, Jiennah, and her child. Baldwin sent Roice a check for $5000 to share with Jiennah as \"a tribute to a fallen soldier,\" the lawsuit states. However, the lawsuit states that after Roice posted the photos of protesters in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 to her Instagram account on January 3, \"in anticipation of the January 6, 2022, one-year anniversary of her attendance\" at the protest, Baldwin commented on Roice's post, \"Are you the same woman that I sent the $ to for your sister's husband who was killed during the Afghanistan exit?\" Roice \"was never detained, arrested, charged with or convicted of any crime associated with her attendance at the January 6, 2021, event in Washington, DC,\" the lawsuit said. She responded to Baldwin, according to the suit, that, \"Protesting is perfectly legal in the country and I've already had my sit down with the FBI. Thanks, have a nice day!\" Baldwin responded, the lawsuit states, with, \"I don't think so. Your activities resulted in the unlawful destruction of government property, the death of a law enforcement officer, an assault on the certification of the presidential election. I reposted your photo. Good luck.\" Approximately 20 minutes after Baldwin posted to Roice's \"Instagram feed,\" she \"began to get hostile, aggressive, hateful messages from Baldwin's followers,\" the suit alleges. Baldwin also posted a message to his own Instagram feed, which he later deleted, stating, \"Lots of Trumpsters chiming in here with the current cry that the attack on the Capitol was a protest, (a more peaceful form of which got a lot of other protestors imprisoned) and an exercise in democracy. That's bulls---.\" His post continued, according to screenshots included in the suit, \"I did some research. I found, on IG, that this woman [Roice McCollum] is the brother (sic) of one of the men who was killed\" killed,\" in Kabul, Afghanistan. \"I offered to send her sister-in-law [Jiennah McCollum] some $ as a tribute to her late brother, his widow and their child. Which I did. As a tribute to a fallen soldier. Then I find this. Truth is stranger than fiction,\" his post added. The suit states Baldwin, \"unequivocally understood that by forwarding Roice's Instagram feed to 2.4 million like-minded followers and posting his commentary would result in the onslaught of threats and hatred that it did.\" Hours after Baldwin's post, Lance's other sister, Cheyenne, and his widow, Jiennah, began receiving \"hateful messages and even death threats,\" according to the suit. \"Neither Cheyenne nor Jiennah\" were in Washington, DC on January 6, 2021,\" the suit claims."

  "title": "US Secret Service assistant director leaves agency after aide's explosive Jan. 6 testimony about him",
  "date": "2022-08-31T02:47:27Z",
  "text": "US Secret Service Assistant Director Tony Ornato left the Secret Service on Monday, a significant departure two months after explosive testimony by a former White House aide, who alleged Ornato had told her then-President Donald Trump was irate upon learning his security detail wouldn't take him to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Ornato on Monday confirmed his departure, which CNN had previously reported citing two sources familiar. He said he left the agency to pursue a career in the private sector. \"I did retire today to pursue a career in the private sector. I retired from the U.S. Secret Service after more than 25 years of faithful service to my country, including serving the past five presidents. I long-planned to retire and have been planning this transition for more than a year,\" Ornato said in a statement to CNN. Ornato told CNN he has not taken a role with the former President or any of his companies. He declined to name his new employer. He told CNN on Tuesday that his legal counsel have been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General to arrange an interview.   \"I plan to continue cooperating with the DHS OIG's investigation,\" Ornato said. \"My counsel have been in touch with the OIG, and they discussed but have not yet settled on a mutually convenient date for us to speak.\" The DHS IG has launched an investigation into the Secret Service preparation and response to the January 6 insurrection.  \"To preserve the integrity of our work and consistent with federal guidelines, DHS OIG does not comment about ongoing reviews. Similarly, we do not confirm the existence of, or comment about, criminal investigations,\" a spokesperson from the DHS OIG told CNN on Tuesday when asked for comment.  The House select committee investigating the insurrection has made clear it believes Ornato was a central figure who could provide valuable information about Trump's movements and intentions leading up to and on January 6. Not only did Ornato once run Trump's detail, but he also made the unprecedented move of joining White House staff as the deputy chief of staff in December 2019 on a temporary assignment and eventually returned to the Secret Service to run its training program.  \"I plan to continue cooperating with the January 6th committee and all other related investigations,\" Ornato said later Tuesday. \"At this point, I am not prepared to make any other comments.\" According to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who serves on the panel, committee members have stressed their desire to speak with Ornato and he has retained private counsel. It's not clear whether Ornato will end up testifying related to the claims from Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. To this point, Ornato has met with the panel on two occasions -- in January and March -- as part of its investigation, according to a source familiar with his testimony. Among the topics Ornato discussed with the committee, the source said, were Trump's knowledge of then-Vice President Mike Pence's whereabouts during the attack on the US Capitol and whether Trump could have done more to encourage the rioters to calm down and leave the building. Ornato's answers to those questions and more have not been revealed by the committee, and members of the panel have expressed frustration with aspects of his testimony, with some suggesting he lacks credibility. Hutchinson specifically testified that Ornato had told her about Trump lashing out in anger and lunging at a member of his protective detail as he demanded to be taken to the Capitol on January 6. A Secret Service official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, previously told CNN that Ornato denies telling Hutchinson that the former President grabbed the steering wheel of his presidential SUV or an agent on his detail. Sources told CNN that Ornato had been eligible for retirement since earlier this summer, and he had been discussing leaving the Secret Service since before Hutchinson's testimony.  This story has been updated with additional developments."

  "title": "Carolyn Maloney's loss sets off Democratic scramble for key committee post",
  "date": "2022-08-24T21:47:07Z",
  "text": "Rep. Carolyn Maloney's resounding loss in her New York primary set off an immediate scramble for her powerful position running the House Oversight Committee, with a bevy of Democrats jockeying for a spot central to their party's investigative priorities. Maloney, who was forced into a member-versus-member primary because of the congressional redistricting process and suffered a stinging defeat to Rep. Jerry Nadler, now will give up her gavel atop the committee at the end of this Congress. Even though an election for the plum spot is months away and won't take effect until next year, several Democrats immediately expressed interest in the position, launching just one of what could be several key leadership battles after the November midterms. Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, a Democrat who lost to Maloney in a race for the chairmanship in 2019, immediately announced a run -- as did Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts. Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who currently serves on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, told CNN he is also mulling a run. And other Democrats may throw their hats in as well. \"We need a tested leader who will not be timid in the face of Republican insurrectionists,\" Connolly said in a statement. Depending on the outcome of the November elections, Democrats could find themselves watching Republicans drive the committee's investigations. If Republicans win the House, as they are currently favored, then the top Democrat on the panel will lack subpoena power and instead serve as their party's top messenger in an attempt to counter the GOP agenda. But if Democrats keep the House, the new chairman will inherit crucial investigations currently being conducted by the panel.  The House Oversight Committee was one of the first entities to raise questions about the documents former President Donald Trump brought with him to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago, and probe whether classified material existed there. The panel recently opened an investigation into the potentially deleted text messages of Secret Service agents from around the dates of the Capitol attack, while also investigating the country's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Connolly currently chairs the House government operations subcommittee and has served on the full committee for 14 years. When announcing his bid, he highlighted his focus on postal reform, defending federal employees and battling the Trump administration. Lynch, who is more senior to Connolly on the committee and serves as chair of the subcommittee on national security, wrote in a letter to colleagues announcing his candidacy, \"I believe that the role of the Oversight Committee is more important now than ever.\" \"As the most senior Democrat running to lead the Committee, I am well prepared to serve at this pivotal moment in our history when it is clear that some Republican members have actively chosen to disregard the truth and their sworn oaths of office in favor of political gamesmanship, divisive rhetoric, and disinformation regarding the 2020 election, the January 6th insurrection, misconduct by former President Trump and other issues of critical concern to the American people.\" The leadership elections are conducted by secret ballot, so it's anyone's guess how the race could turn out. After the midterms, there will be much jockeying for key posts, especially if Speaker Nancy Pelosi steps aside from leading the caucus she has dominated for the better part of the past two decades."
