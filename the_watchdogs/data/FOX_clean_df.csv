https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-committee-primetime-hearing-attack-capitol,FOX,Jan. 6 Committee holds first public hearing investigating attack on the US Capitol,"Lawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee Thursday night plan to present information and testimony to the American people in an effort to show the country, during a primetime congressional hearing, that former President Donald Trump was the key to a plot to overturn the 2020 presidential election.","June 9, 2022 7:15pm EDT","fox news congressional correspondent chad pergram joins 'special report' with the latest on what the american public can expect to find out about the jan. 6 capitol riot on thursday's primetime hearing.  'ultimately, donald trump, the president of the united states, spurred a mob of domestic enemies..to march down the capitol and subvert american democracy,' thompson said. committee vice chair liz cheney, r-wyo., during her opening statement, said americans thursday evening would see 'never-before-seen footage of the brutal attack on our capitol.' 'an attack that unfolded while a few blocks away, president trump sat watching television in the dining room next to the oval office,' cheney said. 'you will hear audio from the brave police officers battling for their lives and fighting to defend our democracy against a violent mob donald trump refused to call off.' 'there is no room for debate. those who invaded our capital and battled law enforcement for hours were motivated by what president trump had told them--that the election was stolen and that he was the rightful president,' cheney said. cheney added: 'president trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.' the select committee is played a never-before-seen video of graphic events that transpired during the jan. 6, 2021 attack on the capitol. thompson, before playing the tape, warned that it 'is hard to watch.' lawmakers on the jan. 6 committee also presented videos of interviews and depositions with former top trump officials before the select committee. during his opening statement, thompson referred to former attorney general bill barr's deposition before the committee. barr said he had three discussions with trump between election day 2020 and his early resignation from the trump administration in december 2020. 'i made it clear i did not agree with the idea that the election was stolen, which, i told the president, was bulls--t,' barr said during his deposition. 'and you know, i didn't want to be a part of it, and that's one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when i did.' barr added that: 'you can't live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election--that there was fraud in the election.' cheney, one of only two republican members on the committee, also played a clip from barr's deposition during her opening statement, again undercutting trump's claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen. cheney presented video testimony from ivanka trump on barr's statement that the justice department found 'no fraud sufficient to overturn the election.' during the video, ivanka trump was asked how barr's statement affected her perspective of the election. 'it affected my perspective,' she testified. 'i respect attorney general barr, so, i accepted what he was saying.' the committee also played video of the testimony of ivanka trump's husband, jared kushner. both were members of the trump administration. meanwhile, cheney said that there is 'no doubt that president trump was well aware of the violence as it developed.' 'white house staff urged president trump to intervene and call off the mob,' cheney said, presenting a document written by a member of the white house staff 'advising what the president needed to say' while the attack was underway at the capitol. 'anyone who entered the capitol without proper authority should leave immediately,' the note cheney presented read. 'this is exactly what his supporters on capitol hill and nationwide were urging the president to do. he would not.' cheney also pointed to congressional leaders who 'begged' trump for help, including republican leader kevin mccarthy, who was ''scared' and called multiple members of president trump's family after he could not persuade the president himself.' 'not only did president trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the capitol, he placed no call to any element of the united states government to instruct that the capitol be defended,' cheney said. 'trump did not call his secretary of defense on january 6th. he did not talk to his attorney general. he did not talk to the department of homeland security.' 'president trump gave no order to deploy the national guard that day, and he made no effort to work with the department of justice to coordinate and display and deploy law enforcement assets,' cheney said. cheney, though, said then-vice president mike pence did contact the pentagon for assets to protect the capitol. cheney played audio of testimony from chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley, who said pence 'was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders--there was no question about that.' milley said pence urged then-defense secretary christopher miller to 'get military down here, get the guard down here, put down this situation.' in contrast, milley shared details of his conversation with then-white house chief of staff mark meadows. 'he said, we have, we have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions,' milley testified meadows said. 'we need to establish the narrative that, you know, that the president is still in charge and that things are steady or stable.' milley added: 'that's something-- i immediately interpret that as politics, politics, politics. red flag for me personally.' the hearing will also feature testimony from two live witnesses — capitol police officer caroline edwards and filmmaker nick quested. but a select committee aide said wednesday the hearing in general will emphasize 'ongoing threats to our democracy' related to trump and jan. 6. 'the vast majority of the material you will see … is previously unseen,' a select committee aide said wednesday. 'whether it is recording video or audio of witnesses we've interviewed, whether it is records that we've obtained over the course of our investigation. republicans are largely not involved in the committee hearings, as just two sit on the panel: cheney and rep. adam kinzinger. republicans have also argued that the committee is ignoring the physical security of the capitol to focus on the trump-related storyline. 'we should study the events that led up to it. why the capitol was left unsecured on jan. 6 when there was intelligence dating back before jan. 6 something was going to happen,' gop rep. jim banks said in an interview with fox news digital. but those supportive of the committee say it is taking capitol security into account. it has a separate investigative team dedicated to security failures. republicans are just using that point to deflect from trump's false claims the election was stolen and alleged culpability in the attack, committee supporters say. thursday's hearing is expected to be just one of several televised hearings from the jan. 6 committee, with the next already announced for monday and wednesday next week. the committee is expected to use their series of hearings to attempt to capture americans’ attention before the november midterm elections—as they compete with inflation, rising gas prices, shortages in baby formula and more for political attention. a select committee aide said the thursday event will serve as an 'opening statement' to grab americans' attention and to preview subsequent hearings. thursday’s hearing comes after months of interviews, depositions and the committee subpoenaing more than 1,000 people and gathering more than 140,000 documents. former president trump on thursday, hours before the hearing, posted on his own truth social, slamming the 'corrupt politicians' on the panel, and blasting them as 'political thugs.' brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trump-says-fulfilling-official-duties-first-lady-jan-6-always-condemn-violence,FOX,Melania Trump says she was 'fulfilling' official duties as first lady on Jan. 6: 'I always condemn violence',"EXCLUSIVE: Former First Lady Melania Trump told Fox News Thursday that she was ""fulfilling"" her duties as first lady of the United States of America on Jan. 6, 2021.","July 21, 2022 3:21pm EDT","check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. 'on january 6, 2021, i was fulfilling one of my duties as first lady of the united states of america, and accordingly, i was unaware of what was simultaneously transpiring at the u.s. capitol building,' trump told fox news digital. 'as with all first ladies who preceded me, it was my obligation to record the contents of the white house’s historic rooms, including taking archival photographs of all the renovations. several months in advance, i organized a qualified team of photographers, archivists, and designers to work with me in the white house to ensure perfect execution,' she continued. 'as required, we scheduled january 6, 2021, to complete the work on behalf of our nation.' the former first lady added that 'this is a very significant undertaking and requires great care, attention to detail, and concentration — both in the planning and execution.' trump went on to say that she has 'always been very supportive of my former chief of staff, stephanie grisham.' 'i stood behind ms. grisham after her failed stint as white house press secretary and welcomed her back to the east wing,' trump said. grisham started her white house tenure in the first lady’s office, and later served as white house press secretary following sarah sanders’ departure during the summer of 2019. she returned to the east wing when kayleigh mcenany was tapped for the role in april 2020. 'ms. grisham was not in the white house on january 6, and her behavior in her role as chief of staff ultimately amounts to dereliction of duty,' trump said, noting that 'traditionally, the first lady’s chief of staff provides detailed briefings surrounding our nation’s important issues.' 'in fact, ms. grisham failed to provide insight and information into the events surrounding january 6 as she had abandoned her post in washington, d.c.,' she continued. 'shamefully, this behavior has only partially become public knowledge; yet was consistent for ms. grisham.' trump added: 'it is evident that grisham’s recent betrayals are a last-ditch attempt to resuscitate her ruined career and reputation.' grisham last month tweeted out a screenshot of a text message conversation she allegedly had with the former first lady on jan. 6, 2021. 'do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every american, but there is no place for lawlessness & violence?' grisham purportedly texted trump. 'no,' trump purportedly replied. grisham’s screenshot shows the two text messages occurred with a contact saved as 'mt.' grisham shared the screenshot a day after former trump aide cassidy hutchinson testified before the jan. 6 committee. 'knowing her as well as i did at that point, it was so unlike her to not have condemned it, that that was the moment it all kind of broke me,' grisham said in an interview last month with cnn. 'yesterday, hearing cassidy’s testimony, i felt compelled to show that text because it was a lot of context i thought, and again, knowing melania like i did, i was so disappointed and discouraged and sickened that she wouldn’t stand up and just say simply, ‘there should be no violence.’' but trump told fox news on thursday: 'i always condemn violence.' 'had i been fully informed of all the details, naturally, i would have immediately denounced the violence that occurred at the capitol building,' trump said. 'and while ms. grisham’s behavior is disappointing, it is not surprising or an isolated incident.' she added: 'this is not the first time a former staffer has tried to maintain relevancy and profit by using my name to create a false narrative.' pro-trump rioters breached the u.s. capitol on jan. 6, 2021, during a joint session of congress to certify the electoral college results in favor of president biden. several people died in connection with the riot. the jan. 6 committee is now holding a series of hearings to attempt to capture americans’ attention before the november midterm elections — as they compete with inflation, rising gas prices and more for political attention. former president donald trump, posting on his truth social before the committee’s first hearing, slammed the 'corrupt politicians' on the panel, and blasted them as 'political thugs.' brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",2022-07-21,-0.9676,Very Negative,"['check', 'clicking', 'january', 'fulfilling', 'duties', 'lady', 'united', 'states', 'america', 'accordingly', 'unaware', 'simultaneously', 'transpiring', 'capitol', 'building', 'trump', 'news', 'digital', 'ladies', 'preceded', 'obligation', 'record', 'contents', 'white', 'house', 'historic', 'rooms', 'including', 'taking', 'archival', 'photographs', 'renovations', 'several', 'months', 'advance', 'organized', 'qualified', 'team', 'photographers', 'archivists', 'designers', 'work', 'white', 'house', 'ensure', 'perfect', 'execution', 'continued', 'required', 'scheduled', 'january', 'complete', 'work', 'behalf', 'nation', 'former', 'lady', 'added', 'significant', 'undertaking', 'requires', 'great', 'care', 'attention', 'detail', 'concentration', 'planning', 'execution', 'trump', 'went', 'say', 'supportive', 'former', 'chief', 'staff', 'stephanie', 'grisham', 'stood', 'behind', 'grisham', 'failed', 'stint', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', 'welcomed', 'back', 'east', 'wing', 'trump', 'grisham', 'started', 'white', 'house', 'tenure', 'lady', 'office', 'later', 'served', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', 'following', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'departure', 'summer', 'returned', 'east', 'wing', 'kayleigh', 'mcenany', 'tapped', 'role', 'april', 'grisham', 'white', 'house', 'january', 'behavior', 'role', 'chief', 'staff', 'ultimately', 'amounts', 'dereliction', 'duty', 'trump', 'noting', 'lady', 'chief', 'staff', 'provides', 'detailed', 'briefings', 'surrounding', 'nation', 'important', 'issues', 'fact', 'grisham', 'failed', 'provide', 'insight', 'information', 'events', 'surrounding', 'january', 'abandoned', 'post', 'washington', 'continued', 'behavior', 'partially', 'become', 'public', 'knowledge', 'yet', 'consistent', 'ms', 'grisham', 'trump', 'added', 'evident', 'grisham', 'recent', 'betrayals', 'attempt', 'resuscitate', 'ruined', 'career', 'reputation', 'grisham', 'last', 'month', 'tweeted', 'screenshot', 'text', 'message', 'conversation', 'allegedly', 'former', 'lady', 'want', 'tweet', 'peaceful', 'protests', 'right', 'every', 'american', 'place', 'lawlessness', 'violence', 'grisham', 'purportedly', 'texted', 'trump', 'trump', 'purportedly', 'replied', 'grisham', 'screenshot', 'shows', 'text', 'messages', 'occurred', 'contact', 'saved', 'grisham', 'shared', 'screenshot', 'day', 'former', 'trump', 'aide', 'cassidy', 'hutchinson', 'testified', 'committee', 'well', 'point', 'unlike', 'condemned', 'moment', 'kind', 'broke', 'grisham', 'interview', 'last', 'month', 'hearing', 'cassidy', 'testimony', 'felt', 'compelled', 'show', 'text', 'lot', 'context', 'thought', 'knowing', 'melania', 'like', 'disappointed', 'discouraged', 'sickened', 'stand', 'say', 'simply', 'trump', 'news', 'thursday', 'always', 'condemn', 'violence', 'fully', 'informed', 'details', 'naturally', 'immediately', 'denounced', 'violence', 'occurred', 'capitol', 'building', 'trump', 'grisham', 'behavior', 'disappointing', 'surprising', 'isolated', 'incident', 'added', 'former', 'staffer', 'tried', 'maintain', 'relevancy', 'profit', 'using', 'name', 'create', 'false', 'narrative', 'rioters', 'breached', 'capitol', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'certify', 'electoral', 'college', 'results', 'favor', 'president', 'biden', 'several', 'people', 'died', 'connection', 'riot', 'committee', 'holding', 'series', 'hearings', 'attempt', 'capture', 'americans', 'attention', 'november', 'midterm', 'elections', 'compete', 'inflation', 'rising', 'gas', 'prices', 'political', 'attention', 'former', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'posting', 'truth', 'social', 'committee', 'hearing', 'slammed', 'politicians', 'panel', 'blasted', 'thugs', 'brooke', 'singman', 'news', 'digital', 'politics', 'reporter', 'reach', 'brookesingman', 'twitter']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-wednesdays-capitol-riot-come-to-fruition,FOX,How Wednesday's Capitol riot came to fruition and who made it happen,"The congressional endeavor of certifying the Presidential winner in the Electoral College is typically a banal ritual. Only this year – following weeks of mounting emotions, filed lawsuits to overturn the results and insistence from President Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen – it became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by thousands storming the Capitol building, shots ringing out, tear gas deployed, and lives lost. So what happened? How did should a showdown come to be?","January 8, 2021 6:59pm EST","<br> so what happened? according to one u.s. military veteran heavily involved in the planning of wednesday's protests, attendees came from across thecountry. 'whether it was veterans for trump or bikers for trump or latinos for trump, we were all there together. we came together by action and the call of our president,' the source, who spoke on background, told fox news. 'our commander-in-chief had requested our assistance, and any veteran with honor listens to the commander-in-chief. that is the spirit in which we live.' in the days leading up to wednesday, trump supporters started 'pouring in,' the source said. 'everything was booked; you couldn't get a room. people were camping out in the cold,' the organizer said, explaining that buses brought supporters from out-of-state. 'it was a call to action. we knew this was going to be a big day and an important point in time.' jan. 6,the date for certification of the electoral college, began with small crowds of trump supporters filtering into designated areas around the ellipse for permit-approved rallies. around 10 a.m., in bone-chilling cold, trump's sons and his longtime lawyer spoke to the growing crowds, and after the president's speech, in which he said he would never concede, thousands marched toward the capitol after he suggested that they should. 'we’re going to walk down to the capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,' trump said. meanwhile, many more protesters accumulated by the white house lawn. within another 40 minutes, the barricades ruptured and thousands headed into the chambers with anger, exhilaration, determinationand confusion. after the initial scuffle and breach,word spread quickly through social media forumsand scores followed each others'footsteps inside. from the one insider's point-of-view, the 'doors were already open to them, and the barricades had been pulled down already.' people simply 'wanted to be heard in the chambers,' they 'wanted their voices heard,' and were 'sick and tired of what had been going on.' trump eventually urged backers to protest 'peacefully and patriotically,' but the chaos continued. but whether or not detailed plans to overrun the federal building had been set in motion earlier was subject to debate. one washington security employee connected to the white house told fox news that it's likely 95%of the attendees were there to protest non-violently. still, there was likely a sub-section of attendees with more violent intentions. 'many of the attackers appeared dressed for a riot – suggesting some element of planning,'said jordan strauss, managing director ofbusiness intelligence and investigations atkroll, a division of new york-based risk consultancy duff & phelps.'but i suspect that it was a combination, with some individuals having announced themselves as having come to storm the capitol or incite some sort of revolution. it would surprise me if some otherwise peaceful protesters were not swept up in the fever of the moment and decided to cross the threshold from peaceful protesters to criminals on the spot.' nonetheless, the drawing in of maga devotees and trump loyalists for the coveted date had long been in the works, mostly through facebook pages and online groups – many of which are above-board, registered non-profit 501c3s. according to a number of those who attended wednesday's events, the big push beganafter trump tweeted on dec. 19: 'big protest in d.c. on january 6. be there, be wild!' 'there's often little sophistication to how these events are planned,'said ryan schonfeld, founder & ceo, ras security group.'the ability to respond in a coordinated manner is possible with the right combination of people and technology making sense of the available data. an exacerbating factor is misinformation, often spread through the use of fake social media and online accounts and profiles.' momentum, augmented heavily by trump's rhetoric, continued to gatheras the reckoning day to 'stop the steal' neared. several already well-established contingencies supporting the president continued to encourage backers to show up, and new facebook groups echoing the rallying cry surfaced. while less-regulated social media sites such as gab and parler have become common platforms for protest discussions, several of those involved told fox news that most communication was not underground or via encryption, but open-source. 'we augment and push out our events through social media messaging, and we have direct coordinators and influencers (with large followings) who help in letting our supporters know event times and locations,' the source continued. 'the point was to be there for the president. all of these patriot groups wanted to be there. we don't want to see the theft of america or a banana republic.' last friday, the first day of 2021, after a surprise early departure from his florida's mar-a-lago residence before ringing in the new year with his most ardent donors, trump tweeted that the 'big protest rally' would begin at 11 a.m. on jan. 6. but how and why the capitol was so easily breached remains a sore point many security experts are piecing together. officials have contended that despite weeks of planning between federal and local law enforcement agencies, which also entailed social media monitoring, there was no intelligence to indicate the historic chaos. the 'lack of intel' linesparked further conspiracies by those at the rally. some involved in wednesday's breach still maintain that it was never their intention --and rather, that anti-trump agitators initiated it. another pro-trump activist vowed that there were 'different anarchists involved,' some of whom took advantage of 'trying to get patriotic, emotionally charged people to do something stupid' --like following the leader into the capitol. nonetheless, the whole episode shookthe washington security apparatus to the core. spending on the police forceincreased from $115 million in 2000 to an estimated $516 million for 2021,he said. and yet, for many americans who still stand by the unfounded notion of a fraudulent 2020 election, in the aftermath of wednesday's bloodshed and with biden's inauguration just 12 days away,they are still firmly committed to the pro-trump cause. one on-the-ground, pro-trump leader who is in the process of gathering video and content to dispel the 'false narratives that (they) are the terrorists or insurgents.' 'people were being funneled into one direction; how do we know it wasn't a deliberate tactic to target us?' the supporter said. 'an unarmed combat veteran was shot. police could have easily used a non-lethal tactic. 'we will always honor our fallen, and we are not going to go away. we want to follow our commander-in-chief, and we are watching and waiting for his next action.'",2021-01-08,-0.9737,Very

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-capitol-riot-one-year-later,FOX,"Jan. 6 Capitol riot – one year later, DC remains on edge","Capitol Police say they’re prepared for what is expected to be an emotional day today, marking one year since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of President Biden’s presidential win.","January 6, 2022 8:48am EST","capitol police say they’re prepared for what is expected to be an emotional day, with multiple vigils, commemorations and demonstrations planned in the nation’s capital. on jan. 6, 2021, after weeks of then-president trump claiming the 2020 election had been stolen from him, thousands of his supporters broke off from his rally at freedom plaza near the white house and headed toward the capitol complex. lawmakers were forced to evacuate the complex and temporarily suspend the certification of the electoral college results as rioters plowed through police perimeters, breached the building and occupied it for several hours. brian sicknick, a 42-year-capitol police officer, was pepper-sprayed during the chaos and died the next day after suffering from two thromboembolic strokes. four other officers who responded to the riot committed suicide in the months following. the counting of the electoral votes resumed hours after the riot, and then-vice president mike pence declared biden the winner. mccarthy, who spoke to trump on jan. 6, told local cbs affiliate kbak that he didn't 'have anything to add' regarding the house committee's investigation and maintained that he has been very public about that day and has nothing to hide. about 275 capitol riot defendants have been charged with a felony offense of attempting to 'corruptly obstruct, influence, or impede' the electoral college certification, the report said. most of those sentenced so far were convicted of misdemeanors, such as illegally entering the capitol building, andfewer than half of those sentenced have received prison time. the median prison sentence for the capitol rioters to date is 45 days, politico reported. palmer’s prison sentence is more than a year and a half longer than any other defendant, politico reported. more than 530 defendants have yet to stand trial, but a handful of trials are tentatively scheduled to begin in april, cbs news reported. nearly a year after the capitol attack, more than 130 capitol police officers have left the department. the capitol police, at this point, is nearly 400 officers short of its authorized level. u.s. capitol police chief j. thomas manger, who took over the force in july, told the senate rules committee in written testimony on wednesday that of the 103recommendations issued by thecapitol police inspector general to strengthen security at the capitol, 'we have implementedand/or addressedover90 of them.' 'the one thing that we have not been able to fix, so to speak, are the staffing issues, and we've lost over 130 officers that have left through either retirements or resignations after january 6,' he said. 'we're aware of several events that are planned for thursday, most of them aren't of much concern to us,' he said. 'there's no intelligence that indicates that there would be any problems.' the police chief did, however, point to one event that authorities are keeping their eye on, a planned demonstration by look ahead america, a conservative group demanding justice for those still jailed after last year's riot. 'there's one event that is occurring, i think down at the d.c. jail that we're paying attention to, but again, really nothing that is of great concern to us at this point,' manger said. the top republican on the committee on house administration, rep. rodney davis, penned a memo to gop colleagues monday titled: 'one year later, little has changed.' davis wrote that there are 'important facts that cannot be ignored about what occurred before, during, and after that day,' saying that democrats on the jan. 6 committee are 'no closer to finding out what led to the catastrophic security failure,' and instead are hellbent to 'attack president trump and punish anyone associated with him.' 'the events of january 6, 2021 exposed serious security vulnerabilities at the capitol complex,' davis wrote. 'unfortunately, over the past twelve months, house democrats have been more interested in exploiting the events of january 6th for political purposes than in conducting basic oversight of the security vulnerabilities exposed that day.' at 2:30 p.m., lawmakers will begin sharing testimonials of the attack in a session led by rep. jason crow, d-colo., which will then be capped off with a bicameral prayer vigil on the capitol center steps at 5:30 p.m. meanwhile, a coalition of more than 130 liberal organizations will hold a candlelight vigil at the national mall starting at 4:45 p.m., and the right-wing look ahead america will hold a vigil outside the d.c. jail. jessica chasmar is a digital writer on the politics team for fox news and fox business. story tips can be sent to jessica.chasmar@fox.com.",2022-01-06,-0.9816,Very Negative,"['capitol', 'police', 'say', 'prepared', 'expected', 'emotional', 'day', 'multiple', 'vigils', 'commemorations', 'demonstrations', 'planned', 'nation', 'capital', 'weeks', 'trump', 'claiming', 'election', 'stolen', 'thousands', 'supporters', 'broke', 'rally', 'freedom', 'plaza', 'near', 'white', 'house', 'headed', 'toward', 'capitol', 'complex', 'lawmakers', 'forced', 'evacuate', 'complex', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'certification', 'electoral', 'college', 'results', 'rioters', 'plowed', 'police', 'perimeters', 'breached', 'building', 'occupied', 'several', 'hours', 'brian', 'sicknick', 'police', 'officer', 'chaos', 'died', 'next', 'day', 'suffering', 'thromboembolic', 'strokes', 'four', 'officers', 'responded', 'riot', 'committed', 'suicide', 'months', 'following', 'counting', 'electoral', 'votes', 'resumed', 'hours', 'riot', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'declared', 'biden', 'winner', 'mccarthy', 'spoke', 'trump', 'local', 'cbs', 'affiliate', 'kbak', 'anything', 'add', 'regarding', 'house', 'committee', 'investigation', 'maintained', 'public', 'day', 'nothing', 'hide', 'capitol', 'riot', 'defendants', 'charged', 'felony', 'offense', 'attempting', 'obstruct', 'influence', 'impede', 'electoral', 'college', 'certification', 'report', 'sentenced', 'far', 'convicted', 'misdemeanors', 'illegally', 'entering', 'capitol', 'building', 'andfewer', 'half', 'sentenced', 'received', 'prison', 'median', 'prison', 'sentence', 'capitol', 'rioters', 'date', 'days', 'politico', 'reported', 'palmer', 'prison', 'sentence', 'year', 'half', 'longer', 'defendant', 'politico', 'reported', 'defendants', 'yet', 'stand', 'trial', 'handful', 'trials', 'tentatively', 'scheduled', 'begin', 'april', 'cbs', 'news', 'reported', 'nearly', 'year', 'capitol', 'attack', 'capitol', 'police', 'officers', 'left', 'department', 'capitol', 'police', 'point', 'nearly', 'officers', 'short', 'authorized', 'level', 'capitol', 'police', 'chief', 'thomas', 'manger', 'took', 'force', 'july', 'senate', 'rules', 'committee', 'written', 'testimony', 'wednesday', 'issued', 'thecapitol', 'police', 'inspector', 'general', 'strengthen', 'security', 'capitol', 'thing', 'able', 'fix', 'speak', 'staffing', 'issues', 'lost', 'officers', 'left', 'either', 'retirements', 'resignations', 'january', 'aware', 'several', 'events', 'planned', 'thursday', 'much', 'concern', 'us', 'intelligence', 'indicates', 'problems', 'police', 'chief', 'however', 'point', 'event', 'authorities', 'keeping', 'eye', 'planned', 'demonstration', 'look', 'ahead', 'america', 'conservative', 'group', 'demanding', 'justice', 'still', 'jailed', 'last', 'year', 'riot', 'event', 'occurring', 'think', 'jail', 'paying', 'attention', 'really', 'nothing', 'great', 'concern', 'us', 'point', 'manger', 'top', 'republican', 'committee', 'house', 'administration', 'rodney', 'davis', 'penned', 'memo', 'gop', 'colleagues', 'monday', 'titled', 'year', 'later', 'little', 'changed', 'davis', 'wrote', 'facts', 'ignored', 'occurred', 'day', 'saying', 'democrats', 'committee', 'closer', 'finding', 'led', 'catastrophic', 'security', 'failure', 'instead', 'hellbent', 'president', 'trump', 'punish', 'anyone', 'associated', 'events', 'january', 'exposed', 'serious', 'security', 'vulnerabilities', 'capitol', 'complex', 'davis', 'wrote', 'past', 'twelve', 'months', 'house', 'democrats', 'interested', 'exploiting', 'events', 'january', 'political', 'purposes', 'conducting', 'basic', 'oversight', 'security', 'vulnerabilities', 'exposed', 'day', 'lawmakers', 'begin', 'sharing', 'testimonials', 'attack', 'session', 'led', 'jason', 'crow', 'capped', 'bicameral', 'prayer', 'vigil', 'capitol', 'center', 'steps', 'meanwhile', 'coalition', 'liberal', 'organizations', 'hold', 'candlelight', 'vigil', 'national', 'mall', 'starting', 'look', 'ahead', 'america', 'hold', 'vigil', 'outside', 'jail', 'jessica', 'chasmar', 'digital', 'writer', 'politics', 'team', 'news', 'business', 'story', 'tips', 'sent']"
https://www.foxnews.com/us/capitol-police-officers-sue-trump-allies-over-jan-6-riot,FOX,"Capitol Police officers sue Trump, allies over Jan. 6 riot","U.S. Capitol Police officers who were attacked and beaten during the Capitol riot filed a lawsuit Thursday against former President Donald Trump, his allies and members of far-right extremist groups, accusing them of intentionally sending a violent mob on Jan. 6 to disrupt the congressional certification of the election.","August 26, 2021 1:12pm EDT","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. the suit was filed on behalf of the seven officers by the lawyers’ committee for civil rights under law. it names the former president, the trump campaign, trump ally roger stone and members of the extremist groups the proud boys and oath keepers who were present at the capitol and in washington on jan. 6. two other similar cases have been filed in recent months by democratic members of congress. the suits allege the actions of trump and his allies led to the violence siege of the capitol that injured dozens of police officers, halted the certification of democrat joe biden’s electoral victory and sent lawmakers running for their lives as rioters stormed into the seat of american democracy wielding bats, poles and other weapons. a house committee has started in earnest to investigate what happened that day, sending out requests wednesday for documents from intelligence, law enforcement and other government agencies. their largest request so far was made to the national archive for information on trump and his former team. trump accused the committee of violating 'long-standing legal principles of privilege' but his team had no immediate comment on thursday's lawsuit. 'executive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of my administration and the patriots who worked beside me, but on behalf of the office of the president of the united states and the future of our nation,' trump said. the suit names as defendants several people who have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. they are alleged to have 'conspired to use force, intimidation, and threats to prevent joe biden and kamala harris from taking office, to prevent congress from counting the electoral votes, and to prevent the capitol police from carrying out their lawful duties.' the filing provides vivid accounts of the injuries the officers sustained while trying to fend off the mob as rioters pushed past lines of overwhelmed law enforcers and barged into the capitol. one officer, jason deroche, was hit with batteries and sprayed with mace and bear spray until his eyes were swollen shut. a second officer, governor latson, was inside the senate chamber when the rioters broke through the doors and beat him as they shouted racial slurs, according to the suit. 'we joined the capitol police to uphold the law and protect the capitol community,' the group of officers said in a statement released by their lawyers. 'on jan. 6 we tried to stop people from breaking the law and destroying our democracy. since then our jobs and those of our colleagues have become infinitely more dangerous. we want to do what we can to make sure the people who did this are held accountable and that no one can do this again.' the documents requested by the house committee this week are just the beginning of what is expected to be lengthy, partisan and rancorous congressional investigation into how the mob was able to infiltrate the capitol and disrupt the certification of democrat joe biden’s presidential victory, inflicting the most serious assault on congress in two centuries. committee members are also considering asking telecommunications companies to preserve phone records of several people, including members of congress, to try to determine who knew what about the unfolding riot and when they knew it. with chants of 'hang mike pence,' the rioters sent the then-vice president and members of congress running for their lives and did more than $1 million in damage, and wounded dozens of police officers. the demands were made for white house records from the national archives, along with material from the departments of defense, justice, homeland security and interior, as well as the fbi and the office of the director of national intelligence. the committee so far has heard from police officers who were at the capitol on jan. 6. in emotional testimony, those officers spoke of how afraid and frustrated they were by the failure of law enforcement leaders to foresee the potential for violence and understand the scope of planning by the trump backers. a capitol police officer who fatally shot protester ashli babbitt was cleared months ago of criminal wrongdoing and was cleared internally by the department this week, and was planning to reveal his identity in an nbc interview to air thursday.",2021-08-26,-0.9944,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'suit',

'i have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,'trump said. 'while this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to make america great again!' house democrats on monday introduced an article of impeachment against the president, saying he incited 'insurrection.' democratic reps. ted lieu, david cicilline, jamie raskinand jerrold nadler introduced the article of impeachment, charging the president with violating his oath of office. house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., said monday that the house 'will move forward with bringing impeachment legislation to the floor.' 'the president’s threat to america is urgent, and so too will be our action,' pelosi said. house majority leader stenyhoyer, later,said the house would meet at 9 a.m. on wednesday to consider thearticleof impeachment. 'in his conduct while president of the united states—and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the united states, and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, donald john trump engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the government of the united states,' the article reads. the article alleges that before jan. 6, the joint session of congress to certify the presidential election results, trump 'repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the american people or certified by state or federal officials.' the article claims that before the jan. 6 joint sessionthe president addressed a crowd in washington where he 'reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide,' and 'willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged--and forseeably resulted in--lawless action at the capitol.' the article refers to trump's statement: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.' 'thus incited by president trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere with the joint session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, unlawfully breached and vandalized the capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced members of congress, the vice president and congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,' the article states. the article adds that trump's conduct 'followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election,' referring to his phone call earlier this month with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, where he pressured him to 'find' enough votes to overturn the state's election results. 'in all this, president trump gravely endangered the security of the united states and its institutions of government,' the article states. 'he threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government.' the article adds that he 'betrayed his trust as president, to the manifest injury of the people of the united states.' 'donald john trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the united states,' it said. brooke

'the vast majority of the material you will see … is previously unseen,' a select committee aide said wednesday. 'whether it is recording video or audio of witnesses we've interviewed, whether it is records that we've obtained over the course of our investigation. thursday's hearing is expected to be just one of several televised hearings from the jan. 6 committee, with the next already announced for monday. a select committee aide said the thursday event will serve as an 'opening statement' to grab americans' attention and to preview subsequent hearings. house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., will lead a press conference thursday morning about the committee. that event follows several national media interviews, media calls and other events at which house gop conference chair elise stefanik, r-n.y.; republican study committee chair jim banks, r-ind.; and others attacked the committee throughout the week. 'i am working closely with president trump, leader kevin mccarthy, jim jordan and my colleaguesto help lead house republicans in pushing back against lame-duck speaker pelosi's shampolitical witch hunt,' stefanik told fox news digital. she and other republicans are making a variety of arguments in opposition to the committee. 'we should study the events that led up to it. why the capitol was left unsecured on jan. 6 when there was intelligence dating back before jan. 6 something was going to happen,' banks said in an interview with fox news digital. but those supportive of the committee say it is taking capitol security into account. it has a separate investigative team dedicated to security failures. republicans are just using that point to deflect from trump's false claims the election was stolen and alleged culpability in the attack, committee supporters say. thursday's hearing will come after months of the committee conducting interviews, depositions and subpoenaing more than 1,000 people and gathering more than 140,000 documents. while much of the grisly footage of smoke filling capitol hallways and trump supporters beating police officers is familiar to americans, the interview and deposition footage may be the newest look for most viewers.

'but this was a tremendous crowd.' trump blamed the sustained occupation of the capitol building on d.c. mayor muriel bowser and house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif, who he said he believed were 'taking care of it.' 'i thought it was a shame, and i kept asking why isn’t she doing something about it? why isn’t nancy pelosi doing something about it? and the mayor of d.c. also. the mayor of d.c. and nancy pelosi are in charge. i hated seeing it. i hated seeing it. and i said, ‘it’s got to be taken care of,’ and i assumed they were taking care of it.' at least 14 officers were wounded during the demonstrations, according to authorities. two officers werehospitalized, including one who sustained serious injuries after he was pulled into a crowd and assaulted, police said. one person was killed in the immediate violence – protester ashley babbitt. babbitt, an air force veteran, was shot and killed during the storming of the capitol by a bullet fired by capitol police officer ​​lt. michael byrd. the documents from the d.c. metropolitan police department show that witnesses did not see babbitt holding a weapon prior to her being shot, and reveal conflicting accounts of whether byrd verbally warned babbitt before shooting her. two other protesters died of heart attacks, and one other died of 'acute amphetamine intoxication,' according to medical examiners. uscp officer brian sicknick died days later of 'natural causes' after being sprayed with a chemical spray. during his speech in the capitol's statuary hall marking the one-year anniversary of the riot, biden said that capitol police officer william evans died 'in the wake of jan. 6,' even though he was killed nearly three months later. evans was killed on april 2, 2021, when noah green rammed two u.s. capitol police officers with his car and emerged wielding a knife. trump communicated with at least some lawmakers during the riot. he spoke, for example, with house republican leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., who asked him to call off the mob, according to republican rep. jaime lynn herrera beutler of washington state, who said mccarthy told her about the call. she said in a statement, 'that’s when, according to mccarthy, the president said, ‘well, kevin, i guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.’' timothy nerozzi is a writer for fox news digital. you can follow him on twitter @timothynerozzi and can email him at timothy.nerozzi@fox.com",2022-04-08,-0.9987,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'service', 'go', 'gone', 'minute', 'trump', 'washington', 'post', 'crowd', 'far', 'bigger', 'even', 'thought', 'believe', 'largest', 'crowd', 'ever', 'spoken', 'means', 'see', 'pictures', 'want', 'show', 'pictures', 'fake', 'news', 'want', 'show', 'pictures', 'trump', 'continued', 'tremendous', 'crowd', 'trump', 'blamed', 'sustained', 'occupation', 'capitol', 'building', 'mayor', 'muriel', 'bowser', 'house', 'speaker', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'believed', 'care', 'thought', 'shame', 'kept', 'asking', 'something', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'something', 'mayor', 'mayor', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'charge', 'hated', 'seeing', 'hated', 'seeing', 'got', 'taken', 'care', 'assumed', 'taking', 'care', 'least', 'officers', 'wounded', 'demonstrations', 'according', 'authorities', 'officers', 'werehospitalized', 'including', 'sustained', 'serious', 'injuries', 'pulled', 'crowd', 'assaulted', 'police', 'person', 'killed', 'immediate', 'violence', 'protester', 'ashley', 'babbitt', 'babbitt', 'air', 'force', 'veteran', 'shot', 'killed', 'storming', 'capitol', 'bullet', 'fired', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'michael', 'byrd', 'documents', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'department', 'show', 'witnesses', 'see', 'babbitt', 'holding', 'weapon', 'prior', 'shot', 'reveal', 'conflicting', 'accounts', 'whether', 'byrd', 'verbally', 'warned', 'babbitt', 'shooting', 'protesters', 'died', 'heart', 'attacks', 'died', 'amphetamine', 'intoxication', 'according', 'medical', 'examiners', 'uscp', 'officer', 'brian', 'sicknick', 'died', 'days', 'later', 'causes', 'sprayed', 'chemical', 'spray', 'speech', 'capitol', 'statuary', 'hall', 'marking', 'anniversary', 'riot', 'biden', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'william', 'evans', 'died', 'wake', 'even', 'though', 'killed', 'nearly', 'three', 'months', 'later', 'evans', 'killed', 'april', 'noah', 'green', 'rammed', 'capitol', 'police', 'officers', 'car', 'emerged', 'wielding', 'knife', 'trump', 'communicated', 'least', 'lawmakers', 'riot', 'spoke', 'example', 'house', 'republican', 'leader', 'kevin', 'mccarthy', 'asked', 'call', 'mob', 'according', 'republican', 'jaime', 'lynn', 'herrera', 'beutler', 'washington', 'state', 'mccarthy', 'call', 'statement', 'according', 'mccarthy', 'president', 'well', 'kevin', 'guess', 'people', 'upset', 'election', 'timothy', 'nerozzi', 'writer', 'news', 'digital', 'follow', 'twitter', 'timothynerozzi', 'email']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-acquitted-in-second-impeachment-trial-for-inciting-jan-6-capitol-riot,FOX,Trump acquitted in second impeachment trial on charge of inciting Jan. 6 Capitol riot,"Former President Trump was acquitted in an unprecedented second impeachment trial on the charge of inciting an insurrection for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, making him the first and only president to be impeached and acquitted twice in history.","February 13, 2021 3:50pm EST","university of baltimore law professor kimberly wehle and former deputy dependent counsel sol wisenberg react on 'america's news hq' sen. patrick leahy, d-vt., who presided over the trial announced the vote fell short of the two-thirds majorityneededand therefore trump is 'herebyacquitted of the charge.' the acquittal means that as ofnow trump can leave the door open to another white house bid in 2024, though senators have hinted they may still try to bar him from office in a separate 14th amendment measure. trump praised the victory, thanked his supportersand promised he'd soon emerge with a 'vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless american future.' the former president, who has largely stayed silent since his impeachment, also took aim at his opponents. the trial surrounded the jan. 6 riot when pro-trump supporters stormed the capitol, beat police officers, chanted 'hang mike pence' and forced lawmakers to take shelter. themayhem temporarily stopped congress' certification of president biden's electoral college win. house impeachment managers accused trump of inciting the insurrection by spreading a 'big lie' the election was stolen from him, summoning his supporters to washington on jan. 6, telling them to 'fight like hell' and then refusing to call off the attack once the mob violently took over the capitol. 'he named the date. henamed the time. hebrought them here, and now he must pay the price,' lead impeachment manager rep. jamie raskin, d-md., said in his closing remarks to the senate. trump legal's team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional 'sham impeachment' against a private citizen, driven by democrats''hatred' for trump and desire to silence a political opponent. trump lawyers also argued theformer president's political speech is protected by the first amendment andhis words on jan. 6 to his supporters to 'fight like hell' were not meantliterally. to drive home that point during the trial, trump's defense played an 11-minute video of nearly every democrat in the chamber using the words 'fight' in their past speeches and interviews. in a curveball move, the senate saturday morning voted 55-45 to allow witnesses at the trial afterraskinsaid they wanted to hear from gop rep.jaime herrera beutler. raskincited the 'breaking news' overnight about details beutler revealed of a heated phone call that trump had with house gop leader kevinmccarthy during the middle of the capitol attack. 'when mccarthy finally reached the president on january 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the capitol,'beutler said in her statement. 'mccarthy refuted that and told the president that these were trump supporters. that's when, according to mccarthy, the president said, 'well, kevin, i guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'' trump's legal team blasted the decision to call witnesses and threatened to depose 100 people if the door is open. a visibly angry and animatedmichaelvan der veen said that house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and vice president kamala harris would 'absolutely' need to be deposed, too, but not by zoom. 'these depositions should be done in person in my office in philadelphia,'van der veen told the senators, which drew audible laughter from the senate chamber. van deer veen shot back: 'i haven't laughed at any of you. and there's nothing laughable here.' the surprise vote on witnesses shook washington and seemed to even catch senators off guard. sen. ted cruz, r-texas, said the move set off 'chaos' in the chamber. he speculated the trial could last until april with witnesses. 'at this point, it's pandemonium,' cruz told pool reporters. but just as quickly as the senate went down the path of witnesses, lawyers then reversed course on saturday. after a recess where lawyers huddled,trump's legal team agreed to allow thedamaging statement from beutler to be entered into the trial as evidence. armed with her statement, house prosecutors thenabandoned theirdemand for witnessesaltogether and moved to closing arguments. house managers said the revelations about mccarthy's call with trump show that trumpabdicated hisoath of office by showing support for the rioters anddisregard for the security of members of congress and pence, who was targeted by the mob for assassination. 'hechose retaining his own power over the safety of americans,' said rep. david cicilline, d-r.i. 'i can't imagine more damning evidence of his state of mind.' the arguments, however, weren't enough to sway the 17 gop senators needed for conviction. gop leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., was very critical of trump's conduct surrounding the jan. 6 riot and his wife--former transportation secretary elaine chao -- even resigned from the administration in the aftermath of the attack that left at least five people dead, including a capitol police officer. 'there's no question... that president trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,' mcconnell said in a speech after the vote saturday. still, mcconnell found trump 'not guilty,' saying he believes convicting theformer president is unconstitutional. rep. joaquin castro, d-texas, one of the impeachment managers, said mcconnell all but admitted the house proved its case but resorted to aprocedural excuse against conviction. 'trump was let off on a technicality and that's essentially what you heard mitch mcconnell say,' castro said. in a news conference after the vote, democratic managers pointed out that the presidentialimpeachment process was the most bipartisan in history, with 10 house republicans and now seven gop senators backing the effort. 'even though we didn't get 67 votes, this has been the most bipartisan vote for impeachment and conviction ever,' castro said. 'and we know that we spoke the truth and the american people by and large have agreed with us.'",2021-02-13,-0.9382,Very Negative,"['university', 'baltimore', 'law', 'professor', 'kimberly', 'wehle',

'that tweet on dec. 19 is when he told people to come to washington on jan. 6 – be there, it will be wild,' was a key moment, a committee aide said. the far-right proud boys and oath keepers groups will be central to the hearing, a committee aide said. the hearing will connect those groups to people in trump's orbit, the aide said, including roger stone and retired gen. mike flynn. the aide said it will also highlight trump's knowledge that the crowd in d.c. could get violent. multiple outlets, including cbs news, are reporting that former oath keepers spokesman jason van tatenhove will testify tuesday. but van totenhove left the group. he told fox31 that he 'purged my life of that world years ago.' his presence during the hearing, he said, is 'to give a historical precedence to this group and how they have radicalized.' the committee says it continues to gather information on jan. 6, its lead-up and its aftermath. this includes a recent interview with former white house counsel pat cipollone. a committee aide did not specify whether video from cipollone's interview will be played during the tuesday hearing. meanwhile, the committee is also considering a recent offer to testify from former trump adviser steve bannon, who faces an upcoming trial on contempt of congress charges. bannon recently said that he will publicly testify before the committee after trump penned a letter purporting to release bannon from any claim of executive privilege. committee members have argued bannon has no real claim to executive privilege because he was not in the administration during or after the 2020 election. bannon did not respond to a request for comment for this story. house minority leader kevin mccarthy picked five republicans for the committee, but pelosi refused to seat two of his choices. that prompted mccarthy to pull all of his picks for the committee, refusing any participation. tuesday's hearing will be the only one for the committee this week. another hearing is expected next week, though the details on that one are not yet clear. tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington, d.c.",2022-07-12,-0.9205,Very Negative,"['senior', 'political', 'analyst', 'brit', 'hume', 'january', 'hearings', 'impact', 'races', 'jamie', 'raskin', 'stephanie', 'murphy', 'lead', 'tuesday', 'hearing', 'according', 'committee', 'aides', 'seventh', 'month', 'tweet', 'people', 'come', 'washington', 'wild', 'key', 'moment', 'committee', 'aide', 'proud', 'boys', 'oath', 'keepers', 'groups', 'central', 'hearing', 'committee', 'aide', 'hearing', 'connect', 'groups', 'people', 'trump', 'orbit', 'aide', 'including', 'roger', 'stone', 'retired', 'mike', 'flynn', 'aide', 'highlight', 'trump', 'knowledge', 'crowd', 'get', 'violent', 'multiple', 'outlets', 'including', 'cbs', 'news', 'reporting', 'former', 'oath', 'keepers', 'spokesman', 'jason', 'van', 'tatenhove', 'testify', 'tuesday', 'van', 'totenhove', 'left', 'group', 'life', 'world', 'years', 'ago', 'presence', 'hearing', 'give', 'historical', 'precedence', 'group', 'radicalized', 'committee', 'says', 'continues', 'gather', 'information', 'aftermath', 'includes', 'recent', 'interview', 'former', 'white', 'house', 'counsel', 'pat', 'cipollone', 'committee', 'aide', 'specify', 'whether', 'video', 'cipollone', 'interview', 'played', 'tuesday', 'hearing', 'meanwhile', 'committee', 'considering', 'recent', 'offer', 'testify', 'former', 'trump', 'adviser', 'steve', 'bannon', 'faces', 'upcoming', 'trial', 'contempt', 'congress', 'charges', 'bannon', 'recently', 'publicly', 'testify', 'committee', 'trump', 'penned', 'letter', 'purporting', 'release', 'bannon', 'claim', 'executive', 'privilege', 'committee', 'members', 'argued', 'bannon', 'real', 'claim', 'executive', 'privilege', 'administration', 'election', 'bannon', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'story', 'house', 'minority', 'leader', 'kevin', 'mccarthy', 'picked', 'five', 'republicans', 'committee', 'pelosi', 'refused', 'seat', 'choices', 'prompted', 'mccarthy', 'pull', 'picks', 'committee', 'refusing', 'participation', 'tuesday', 'hearing', 'committee', 'week', 'another', 'hearing', 'expected', 'next', 'week', 'though', 'details', 'yet', 'clear', 'tyler', 'olson', 'capitol', 'hill', 'producer', 'news', 'washington']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-loves-the-idea-of-testifying-before-jan-6-committee-source-says-as-trump-slams-investigation,FOX,Trump 'loves the idea of testifying' before Jan. 6 committee: source close to the former president,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Donald Trump “loves the idea of testifying” before the House select committee investigating January 6th, a source close to Trump told Fox News Digital just after the panel unanimously voted to subpoena him.","October 13, 2022 5:10pm EDT","andy mccarthy, byron york and marc thiessen react to the jan. 6 committee's surprise subpoena vote on 'the story.' the source told fox news digital that it is unclear at this point if trump actually will testify before the committee, but stressed that trump 'loves the idea.' the committee — which consists of seven democrats and two anti-trump republicans — voted thursday to compel trump to testify about his conduct leading up to and during the capitol riot on jan. 6, 2021. in an exclusive interview with fox news digital on thursday, trump slammed the committee and its investigation as a 'witch hunt.' 'the committee is a hoax, a sham, a partisan witch hunt which is a continuation of the witch hunt that has gone on since the great day for our country that i came down the golden escalator with our future first lady,' trump said. 'they have no case, they have no ratings, so they have to try to do this to get publicity.' trump did not comment on whether he would testify before the committee. trump told fox news digital that the investigation has been 'a partisan witch hunt, together with two republicans that have been thrown out of the party — one not wanting to run because he couldn’t win; and another losing by a record number of more than 40 points.' trump was referring to rep. liz cheney, r-wyo., who lost her primary earlier this year, and rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., who decided not to run for re-election. trump told fox news digital that the committee 'never covered the important subject of election fraud, or why pelosi and the mayor of d.c. did not call up the national guard — which i strongly recommended.' 'they didn’t cover the reason for january 6 — the largest crowd — it wasn’t set up by me,' trump said. 'the committee didn’t cover election fraud, which was massive, and they didn't cover why pelosi didn’t call the national guard.' he added: 'they were derelict in their duty. i gave them the authorization and the recommendation to call up the national guard.' lawmakers on the house committee on jan. 6 have been investigating the attack on the capitol on jan. 6, 2021, and allege that trump’s insistence that the 2020 election was stolen stoked the violence as congress convened to certify the electoral college votes. hours before the riot, trump held a rally in washington, d.c., in which he encouraged his supporters to protest president biden's electoral college certification. trump told his followers during that speechto protest 'peacefully and patriotically,' but, in the weeks leading up to the certification, suggested the rally would be 'wild.' trump's spokesman taylor budowich tweeted after the vote thursday that just 26 days before the midterm elections, 'instead of using their final days in power to make life for americans any better, democrats are doubling and tripling down on their partisan theatrics. democrats have no solutions and they have no interest in leading our great nation.' 'they are simply bitter, power hungry & desperate,' budowich tweeted. 'pres trump will not be intimidated by their meritless rhetoric or un-american actions.' he added: 'trump-endorsed candidates will sweep the midterms, and america first leadership & solutions will be restored. make america great again!' the vote to subpoena trump came during the committee’s 10th and likely final public hearing before the november midterm elections. originally, the televised hearing was meant to only showcase new evidence and summarize findings from the committee’s nearly 16-month-long investigation. 'this is a question about accountability to the american people,' said committee chairman rep. bennie thompson, d-miss. 'he's required to answer to those millions of americans whose votes he tried to throw out as part of his scheme to remain in power.' members of the committee said they had garnered sufficient evidence showing that the former president was the lead instigator of the attack on the u.s. capitol. 'we must seek the testimony under oath of jan. 6th's key player,' said cheney. trump could fight the subpoena, which likely would tip off a legal fight with just over two months left in the current congress — a very short time frame for such a major legal dispute. if republicans take over the house in the midterms, it's not expected they will continue the work of the jan. 6 committee. there was an effort by congress in the 1840s to subpoena former presidents john tyler and john quincy adams over clandestine intelligence issues. they never provided information. there was also an effort by the committee on un-american activities to subpoena former president harry truman after he was out of office. he ultimately did not comply. brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",2022-10-13,-0.9708,Very Negative,"['andy', 'mccarthy', 'byron', 'york', 'marc', 'thiessen', 'react', 'committee', 'surprise', 'subpoena', 'vote', 'story', 'source', 'news', 'digital', 'unclear', 'point', 'trump', 'actually', 'testify', 'committee', 'stressed', 'trump', 'idea', 'committee', 'consists', 'seven', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'voted', 'thursday', 'compel', 'trump', 'testify', 'conduct', 'leading', 'capitol', 'riot', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'news', 'digital', 'thursday', 'trump', 'slammed', 'committee', 'investigation', 'hunt', 'committee', 'hoax', 'sham', 'partisan', 'witch', 'hunt', 'continuation', 'witch', 'hunt', 'gone', 'since', 'great', 'day', 'country', 'came', 'golden', 'escalator', 'future', 'lady', 'trump', 'case', 'ratings', 'try', 'get', 'publicity', 'trump', 'comment', 'whether', 'testify', 'committee', 'trump', 'news', 'digital', 'investigation', 'partisan', 'witch', 'hunt', 'together', 'republicans', 'thrown', 'party', 'wanting', 'run', 'win', 'another', 'losing', 'record', 'number', 'points', 'trump', 'referring', 'liz', 'cheney', 'lost', 'primary', 'earlier', 'year', 'adam', 'kinzinger', 'decided', 'run', 'trump', 'news', 'digital', 'committee', 'covered', 'important', 'subject', 'election', 'fraud', 'pelosi', 'mayor', 'call', 'national', 'guard', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'cover', 'reason', 'january', 'largest', 'crowd', 'set', 'trump', 'committee', 'cover', 'election', 'fraud', 'massive', 'cover', 'pelosi', 'call', 'national', 'guard', 'added', 'derelict', 'duty', 'gave', 'authorization', 'recommendation', 'call', 'national', 'guard', 'lawmakers', 'house', 'committee', 'investigating', 'attack', 'capitol', 'allege', 'trump', 'insistence', 'election', 'stolen', 'stoked', 'violence', 'congress', 'convened', 'certify', 'electoral', 'college', 'votes', 'hours', 'riot', 'trump', 'held', 'rally', 'washington', 'encouraged', 'supporters', 'protest', 'president', 'biden', 'electoral', 'college', 'certification', 'trump', 'followers', 'speechto', 'protest', 'patriotically', 'weeks', 'leading', 'certification', 'suggested', 'rally', 'trump', 'spokesman', 'taylor', 'budowich', 'tweeted', 'vote', 'thursday', 'days', 'midterm', 'elections', 'using', 'final', 'days', 'power', 'make', 'life', 'americans', 'better', 'democrats', 'doubling', 'tripling', 'partisan', 'theatrics', 'democrats', 'solutions', 'interest', 'leading', 'great', 'nation', 'simply', 'bitter', 'power', 'hungry', 'desperate', 'budowich', 'tweeted', 'trump', 'intimidated', 'meritless', 'rhetoric', 'actions', 'added', 'candidates', 'sweep', 'midterms', 'america', 'leadership', 'solutions', 'restored', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'vote', 'subpoena', 'trump', 'came', 'committee', 'likely', 'final', 'public', 'hearing', 'november', 'midterm', 'elections', 'originally', 'televised', 'hearing', 'meant', 'showcase', 'new', 'evidence', 'summarize', 'findings', 'committee', 'nearly', 'investigation', 'question', 'accountability', 'american', 'people', 'committee', 'chairman', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'required', 'answer', 'millions', 'americans', 'whose', 'votes', 'tried', 'throw', 'part', 'scheme', 'remain', 'power', 'members', 'committee', 'garnered', 'sufficient', 'evidence', 'showing', 'former', 'president', 'lead', 'instigator', 'attack', 'capitol', 'must', 'seek', 'testimony', 'oath', 'key', 'player', 'cheney', 'trump', 'fight', 'subpoena', 'likely', 'tip', 'legal', 'fight', 'months', 'left', 'current', 'congress', 'short', 'frame', 'major', 'legal', 'dispute', 'republicans', 'house', 'midterms', 'expected', 'continue', 'work', 'committee', 'effort', 'congress', 'subpoena', 'former', 'presidents', 'john', 'tyler', 'john', 'quincy', 'adams', 'clandestine', 'intelligence', 'issues', 'never', 'provided', 'information', 'effort', 'committee', 'activities', 'subpoena', 'former', 'president', 'harry', 'truman', 'office', 'ultimately', 'comply', 'brooke', 'singman', 'news', 'digital', 'politics', 'reporter', 'reach', 'brookesingman', 'twitter']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-hearing-recreate-trumps-state-mind-during-riot-without-testimony-former-president-top-allies,FOX,"Jan. 6 hearing to recreate Trump's state of mind during riot without testimony by former president, top allies",The House Jan. 6 committee is planning to wind down public hearings without receiving testimony from former President Donald Trump or his top associates.,"October 13, 2022 2:00am EDT","fox news state department correspondent rich edson covers potential criminal charges against former president trump in the wake of the jan. 6 committee and doj investigations on 'special report.' 'we're going to bring a particular focus on the former president's state of mind and his involvement in these events as they unfolded,' said the aide. 'what you're going to see is a synthesis of some evidence we've already presented with new, never-before-seen information to illustrate donald trump's centrality was key.' the committee will try to recreate the former president's state of mind leading up to and during the riot, despite his refusal to cooperate with the committee. trump has not only rejected overtures to testify before the panel, but he has called on allies and former staffs to do likewise. members of the committee, however, say their findings will speak for themselves. the hearing comes after the committee's interview with ginni thomas, the wife of supreme court justice clarence thomas, two weeks ago. thomas voluntarily appeared before the committee after reports emerged she was allegedly in contact with the white house and lawmakers in arizona and wisconsin ahead of jan. 6. the committee's members, seven democrats and two anti-trump republicans, will each present a portion of their findings. some will summarize the 15-month investigation, while others will focus on the alleged ties between trump staffers and extremist groups that breach the capitol on jan. 6, 2021. while some evidence presented is likely to be new, few believe the committee has anything close to a smoking gun implicating trump. that reality is something the panel is wrestling with as it holds what is likely its final hearing before the midterm election. complicating the push for a clear resolution is that the panel has not heard testimony from trump and other key players that were in the white house or congress on jan. 6. not only has trump refused to cooperate with the panel but so have the former president's top congressional allies. rep. andy biggs, r-ariz., has defied a congressional subpoena by the committee to sit for a deposition. 'the committee operates with the same kind of bias present at the salem witch trials,' said biggs, who the committee alleges pressured state leaders in arizona to decertify president biden's 2020 election victory. 'everyone is guilty and must demonstrate their innocence.' perry is alleged by the committee to have been a key link between trump and assistant attorney general jeffrey clark, who pushed for the doj to back the former president's claim of electoral fraud in 2020. mccarthy, meanwhile, had a phone call with trump as protesters stormed the capitol on jan. 6. the committee has similarly had little luck in getting senior trump administration staff to talk. senior trump white house official peter navarro, in particular, was indicted for contempt for congress for defying the committee's subpoena to testify. according to the committee, navarro was responsible for spearheading trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. 'he has written a book boasting about his role in planning and coordinating the activity of jan. 6. we have many questions for mr. navarro,' said rep. liz cheney of wyoming, one of two republicans on the jan. 6 panel. navarro, for his part, has cited executive privilege as the reason for his decision to not cooperate. also likely missing from the committee's hearing on thursday will be former vice president mike pence. the indiana republican, according to the committee, was the target of heavy pressure from trump and allies to reject electoral college votes from certain states while presiding over the tally on jan. 6. pence has said he would be open to testifying in front of the panel. the former vice president's staff told fox news digital the committee had been in touch with the pence legal team but that no progress has been made about him testifying. while key players in the jan. 6 drama have been left out or refused to comply, the panel has found some success. apart from gaining access to tens of thousands of documents, the committee has conducted nearly 1,000 interviews during its 15-month tenure. apart from thomas, those interviews were with high-profile white house figures, including ivanka trump and her husband, jared kushner, as well former attorney general bill barr. although the committee still could hold further hearings in preparation for the release of its final report later this year, the panel is quickly approaching its end date. the committee is set to disband at the end of this congress unless lawmakers vote to reauthorize it next year. that likelihood is slim given that republicans, who have refused to take part in the panel's deliberations, are expected to win control of the house. 'it’s the most political and least legitimate committee in american history,' said mccarthy 'it has used congressional subpoenas to attack republicans, violate due process and infringe on the political speech of private citizens.' haris alic is a politics reporter for fox news digital covering congress.",2022-10-13,-0.6681,Very Negative,"['news', 'state', 'department', 'correspondent', 'rich', 'edson', 'covers', 'potential', 'criminal', 'charges', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'wake', 'committee', 'doj', 'investigations', 'report', 'bring', 'particular', 'focus', 'former', 'president', 'state', 'mind', 'involvement', 'events', 'unfolded', 'aide', 'see', 'synthesis', 'evidence', 'already', 'presented', 'new', 'information', 'illustrate', 'donald', 'trump', 'centrality', 'key', 'committee', 'try', 'recreate', 'former', 'president', 'state', 'mind', 'leading', 'riot', 'despite', 'refusal', 'cooperate', 'committee', 'trump', 'rejected', 'overtures', 'testify', 'panel', 'called', 'allies', 'former', 'staffs', 'likewise', 'members', 'committee', 'however', 'say', 'findings', 'speak', 'hearing', 'comes', 'committee', 'interview', 'ginni', 'thomas', 'wife', 'supreme', 'court', 'justice', 'clarence', 'thomas', 'weeks', 'ago', 'thomas', 'voluntarily', 'appeared', 'committee', 'reports', 'emerged', 'allegedly', 'contact', 'white', 'house', 'lawmakers', 'arizona', 'wisconsin', 'ahead', 'committee', 'members', 'seven', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'present', 'portion', 'findings', 'summarize', 'investigation', 'others', 'focus', 'alleged', 'ties', 'trump', 'staffers', 'extremist', 'groups', 'breach', 'capitol', 'evidence', 'presented', 'likely', 'new', 'believe', 'committee', 'anything', 'close', 'smoking', 'gun', 'implicating', 'trump', 'reality', 'something', 'panel', 'wrestling', 'holds', 'likely', 'final', 'hearing', 'midterm', 'election', 'complicating', 'push', 'clear', 'resolution', 'panel', 'heard', 'testimony', 'trump', 'key', 'players', 'white', 'house', 'congress', 'trump', 'refused', 'cooperate', 'panel', 'former', 'president', 'top', 'congressional', 'allies', 'andy', 'biggs', 'defied', 'congressional', 'subpoena', 'committee', 'sit', 'deposition', 'committee', 'operates', 'kind', 'bias', 'present', 'salem', 'witch', 'trials', 'biggs', 'committee', 'alleges', 'pressured', 'state', 'leaders', 'arizona', 'decertify', 'president', 'biden', 'election', 'victory', 'guilty', 'must', 'demonstrate', 'innocence', 'perry', 'alleged', 'committee', 'key', 'link', 'trump', 'assistant', 'attorney', 'general', 'jeffrey', 'clark', 'pushed', 'doj', 'back', 'former', 'president', 'claim', 'electoral', 'fraud', 'mccarthy', 'meanwhile', 'phone', 'call', 'trump', 'protesters', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'committee', 'similarly', 'little', 'luck', 'getting', 'senior', 'trump', 'administration', 'staff', 'talk', 'senior', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'official', 'peter', 'navarro', 'particular', 'indicted', 'contempt', 'congress', 'defying', 'committee', 'subpoena', 'testify', 'according', 'committee', 'navarro', 'responsible', 'spearheading', 'trump', 'efforts', 'overturn', 'election', 'written', 'book', 'boasting', 'role', 'planning', 'coordinating', 'activity', 'many', 'questions', 'navarro', 'liz', 'cheney', 'wyoming', 'republicans', 'panel', 'navarro', 'part', 'cited', 'executive', 'privilege', 'reason', 'decision', 'cooperate', 'likely', 'missing', 'committee', 'hearing', 'thursday', 'former', 'vice', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'indiana', 'republican', 'according', 'committee', 'target', 'heavy', 'pressure', 'trump', 'allies', 'reject', 'electoral', 'college', 'votes', 'certain', 'states', 'presiding', 'tally', 'pence', 'open', 'testifying', 'front', 'panel', 'former', 'vice', 'president', 'staff', 'news', 'digital', 'committee', 'touch', 'pence', 'legal', 'team', 'progress', 'made', 'testifying', 'key', 'players', 'drama', 'left', 'refused', 'comply', 'panel', 'found', 'success', 'apart', 'gaining', 'access', 'tens', 'thousands', 'documents', 'committee', 'conducted', 'nearly', 'interviews', 'tenure', 'apart', 'thomas', 'interviews', 'white', 'house', 'figures', 'including', 'ivanka', 'trump', 'husband', 'jared', 'kushner', 'well', 'former', 'attorney', 'general', 'bill', 'barr', 'although', 'committee', 'still', 'hold', 'hearings', 'preparation', 'release', 'final', 'report', 'later', 'year', 'panel', 'quickly', 'approaching', 'end', 'date', 'committee', 'set', 'disband', 'end', 'congress', 'unless', 'lawmakers', 'vote', 'reauthorize', 'next', 'year', 'likelihood', 'slim', 'given', 'republicans', 'refused', 'part', 'panel', 'deliberations', 'expected', 'win', 'control', 'house', 'political', 'least', 'legitimate', 'committee', 'american', 'history', 'mccarthy', 'used', 'congressional', 'subpoenas', 'attack', 'republicans', 'violate', 'due', 'process', 'infringe', 'political', 'speech', 'private', 'citizens', 'haris', 'alic', 'politics', 'reporter', 'news', 'digital', 'covering', 'congress']"

They were arrested after fellow Marines helped investigators identify the suspects in a recorded video.,"January 20, 2023 4:51pm EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. no defense lawyers for the men were listed in the court docket, so it was not immediately clear whether they have attorneys to comment on their behalf. their service records show they are all active-duty marines. maj. kevin stephensen, a spokesman for the marine corps, said it is aware of the allegations and 'is fully cooperating with appropriate authorities in support of the investigation.' the men spent about 52 minutes inside the capitol, authorities say. at one point while in the rotunda, they put a red 'make american great again' hat on a statue to take pictures with it, according to court papers. hellonen was carrying a 'don’t tread on me' flag, authorities said. coomer posted photos on instagram that appeared to be taken inside the capitol with the caption 'glad to be apart of history,' according to court documents. days after the 2020 election, he and another person discussed over instagram message how he believed the election was rigged. and in late january 2021, he told another person in a message that 'everything in this country is corrupt.' 'we honestly need a fresh restart. i’m waiting for the boogaloo,' coomer wrote in a message detailed in court documents. when asked by the person what's 'a boogaloo,' coomer responded 'civil war 2,' authorities said. the boogaloo is an anti-government, pro-gun extremist movement. its name is a reference to a slang term for a sequel — in this case, a second u.s. civil war. the movement is named after 'breakin’ 2: electric boogaloo,' a 1984 sequel to a movie about breakdancing. supporters have shown up at protests over covid-19 lockdown orders and protests over racial injustice, carrying rifles and wearing tactical gear over hawaiian shirts. the shirts are a reference to 'big luau,' a riff on the term 'boogaloo' sometimes favored by group members. during an interview related to his security clearance in june, abate acknowledged walking through the capitol with two 'buddies,' investigators said. abate said they 'walked around and tried not to get hit with tear gas.' the pentagon said abate was assigned to the marine cryptologic support battalion, which supports the national security agency. one of the largest u.s. intelligence agencies, the nsa spies on electronic communications around the world and has a critical role in deterring cyberattacks and foreign influence operations. a spokesperson for the nsa declined to answer questions about when the agency learned of abate’s statement that he had entered the capitol or if it took action prior to his arrest to restrict his access to classified information. the trio face charges including illegal entry and disorderly conduct. and a former u.s. army reservist described by prosecutors as a nazi sympathizer was convicted of storming the capitol to obstruct congress from certifying president joe biden’s electoral victory. timothy hale-cusanelli, who was employed as a security contractor at a navy base, was sentenced to four years in prison in september. nearly 1,000 people have been charged so far in the riot and the tally increases by the week. almost 500 people have pleaded guilty to riot-related charges and more than three dozen have been convicted at trial.",2023-01-20,-0.8513,Very

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-trump-capitol-riot-senate-weighs-another-impeachment-trial,FOX,McConnell says Trump 'provoked' the Capitol riot as Senate weighs another impeachment trial,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., placed blame on President Trump for the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer.","January 19, 2021 1:53pm EST","senate majority leader mitch mcconnell discusses the capitol riots and biden's inauguration during senate address. 'the mob was fed lies,' mcconnell said. 'they were provoked by the president and other powerful people.' '...but we pressed on. we stood together and said an angry mob would not get veto power over the rule of law in our nation, not even for one night.' the culmination of his efforts to stop biden from taking office came when hecalledhis supporters to washington on jan. 6 and whippedup the crowd before they marched to the capitol to try tostop congress from certifying biden's win. the insurrection forced congress to abruptly recess and take shelter. yet thelawmakers later reconvened and certified biden's victory -- despite some gop objections, led by sens. ted cruz of texasand josh hawley of missouri. 'we certified the people's choice for their 46th president,' mcconnell said. 'tomorrow president-elect biden and vice president-elect [kamala] harris will be sworn in. we'll have a safe and successful inaugural.' mcconnell is seen as the lynchpin to any chance trump would be convicted in the senate. unlike some of his gop colleagues, mcconnell has not rejectedimpeachment outright and said he'd carefully weigh the evidence during a trial. if mcconnell joins with democrats in convicting trump, he may clear the way for 16 other republicans to join him toreach the two-thirds vote threshold. mcconnell and gop senate leadership have not been whipping their colleagues to hold the line and protect trump. sen. john cornyn, r-texas, told reporters tuesday that impeachment will be a 'vote of conscience' for the senators. once house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., sends over the article of impeachment to the senate, it would trigger a trial that would likely slow down the senate's business of confirming biden's incoming cabinet. some gop senators -- including sens. tom cotton of arkansasand joni ernst of iowa-- have argued it could be unconstitutional to even hold a trial for trump when he's out of office, though other legal scholars disagree. sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., the incoming majority leader, met with mcconnell later tuesday afternoon for about 30 minutesto discuss anew power-sharing agreement, biden cabinet nominationsand how to proceed on impeachment. 'all i’m going to say is we discussed a whole lot of issues,' schumer said as he departed mcconnell'soffice. democrats will hold a tie-breaking majoritywednesday afternoon when the biden administration takes over and three new democratic senators are set to besworn-in: georgia democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock and california's alex padilla, who will succeed harris. schumer said tuesday there will be a senate impeachment trial. and if trump is convicted, the senate will take a vote to bar him from running for office ever again. 'once he leaves office, do we really expect him to change his tune and accept the truth?' schumer said. 'of course not. he will continue spreading lies about the election and stoking the grievances of his most radical supporters. using the prospect of a future presidential run to poison the public arena.' 'donald trump should not be eligible to run for office ever again,' schumer added. 'all of us want to put this awful chapter in our nation's history behind us.'",2021-01-19,0.8658,Very Positive,"['senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'discusses', 'capitol', 'riots', 'biden', 'inauguration', 'senate', 'address', 'mob', 'fed', 'lies', 'mcconnell', 'provoked', 'president', 'powerful', 'people', 'pressed', 'stood', 'together', 'angry', 'mob', 'get', 'veto', 'power', 'rule', 'law', 'nation', 'even', 'night', 'culmination', 'efforts', 'stop', 'biden', 'taking', 'office', 'came', 'hecalledhis', 'supporters', 'washington', 'whippedup', 'crowd', 'marched', 'capitol', 'try', 'tostop', 'congress', 'certifying', 'biden', 'win', 'insurrection', 'forced', 'congress', 'abruptly', 'recess', 'shelter', 'yet', 'thelawmakers', 'later', 'reconvened', 'certified', 'biden', 'victory', 'despite', 'gop', 'objections', 'led', 'sens', 'ted', 'cruz', 'texasand', 'josh', 'hawley', 'missouri', 'certified', 'people', 'choice', 'president', 'mcconnell', 'biden', 'vice', 'kamala', 'harris', 'sworn', 'safe', 'successful', 'inaugural', 'mcconnell', 'seen', 'lynchpin', 'chance', 'trump', 'convicted', 'senate', 'unlike', 'gop', 'colleagues', 'mcconnell', 'rejectedimpeachment', 'outright', 'carefully', 'weigh', 'evidence', 'trial', 'mcconnell', 'joins', 'democrats', 'convicting', 'trump', 'may', 'clear', 'way', 'republicans', 'join', 'toreach', 'vote', 'threshold', 'mcconnell', 'gop', 'senate', 'leadership', 'whipping', 'colleagues', 'hold', 'line', 'protect', 'trump', 'john', 'cornyn', 'reporters', 'tuesday', 'impeachment', 'conscience', 'senators', 'house', 'speaker', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'sends', 'article', 'impeachment', 'senate', 'trigger', 'trial', 'likely', 'slow', 'senate', 'business', 'confirming', 'biden', 'incoming', 'cabinet', 'gop', 'senators', 'including', 'sens', 'tom', 'cotton', 'arkansasand', 'joni', 'ernst', 'iowa', 'argued', 'unconstitutional', 'even', 'hold', 'trial', 'trump', 'office', 'though', 'legal', 'scholars', 'disagree', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'incoming', 'majority', 'leader', 'met', 'mcconnell', 'later', 'tuesday', 'afternoon', 'minutesto', 'discuss', 'anew', 'agreement', 'biden', 'cabinet', 'nominationsand', 'proceed', 'impeachment', 'say', 'discussed', 'whole', 'lot', 'issues', 'schumer', 'departed', 'democrats', 'hold', 'majoritywednesday', 'afternoon', 'biden', 'administration', 'takes', 'three', 'new', 'democratic', 'senators', 'set', 'georgia', 'democrats', 'jon', 'ossoff', 'raphael', 'warnock', 'california', 'alex', 'padilla', 'succeed', 'harris', 'schumer', 'tuesday', 'senate', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'trump', 'convicted', 'senate', 'vote', 'bar', 'running', 'office', 'ever', 'leaves', 'office', 'really', 'expect', 'change', 'tune', 'accept', 'truth', 'schumer', 'course', 'continue', 'spreading', 'lies', 'election', 'stoking', 'grievances', 'radical', 'supporters', 'using', 'prospect', 'future', 'presidential', 'run', 'poison', 'public', 'arena', 'trump', 'eligible', 'run', 'office', 'ever', 'schumer', 'added', 'us', 'want', 'put', 'awful', 'chapter', 'nation', 'history', 'behind', 'us']"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-truth-happened-jan-6-unknown,FOX,Tucker Carlson: The truth of what happened on Jan. 6 is still unknown,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson analyzes what really happened at the Capitol riots and gives his take on the January 6 Committee on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""","June 9, 2022 10:09pm EDT","fox news host tucker carlson gives his take on the capitol riots and the january 6 committee's primetime hearing on 'tucker carlson tonight.' yet the other networks can't be bothered to cover any of that tonight. instead, they've interrupted their regularly scheduled programing to bring you yet another extended primetime harangue from nancy pelosi and liz cheney about donald trump and qanon. the whole thing is insulting.  in fact, it's deranged and we're not playing along. this is the only hour on an american news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live. they are lying, and we are not going to help them do it. what we will do instead is to try to tell you the truth. we've attempted to do that since the day this happened. we hated seeing vandalism at the u.s. capitol a year and a half ago, and we said so at the time, but we did not think it was an insurrection because it was not an insurrection. it was not even close to an insurrection. not a single person in the crowd that day was found to be carrying a firearm – some insurrection. in fact, the only person who wound up shot to death was a protester.  she was a 36-year-old military veteran called ashli babbitt. babbitt was just over 5 feet tall. she was unarmed. she posed no conceivable threat to anyone, but capitol hill police shot her in the neck and never explained why that was justified. those are the facts of january 6, but since the very first hours, they have been distorted beyond recognition, relentlessly culminating with last night.  last night, cbs nightly news told its viewers that insurrectionists at the capitol on january 6 'caused the deaths of five police officers.' that is a pure lie. there is nothing true about it, and they know that perfectly well. here's reporter bob costa, who should be deeply ashamed to say something this dishonest.  it's hard to believe he said that. rioters cause the deaths of five police officers. you just heard cbs news tell its viewers that. this must be the big lie theory. the more bewilderingly false a claim is, the more likely you will be to believe it. apparently, that's what they're betting on. in fact, precisely zero police officers were killed by rioters on january 6, not five, none. not a single one. so, how'd they get to five? well, cbs is counting the suicides of local police officers that took place after january 6, in some cases, long after january 6.  suicide, unfortunately, is pretty common among cops. policing is a tough job, as we've noted. but in these specific cases, the ones cbs is referring to, the chief of washington dc's police department told the new york times that actually he had no idea if his officers were driven to kill themselves by january 6. cbs just made that up. the fifth death that cbs news is referring to is of capitol hill police officer brian sicknick. you will remember his name. sicknick's body lay in state at the capitol after the media told us he'd been beaten to death by trump voters with a fire extinguisher. here's what they told you.  once again, that's not true. everything you just heard was completely fabricated. the d.c. medical examiner performed an autopsy and the autopsy report showed that officer brian sicknick had not suffered any kind of blunt force trauma. he was not beaten to death. he died of a stroke in his office later. no one has been charged in officer sicknick's death because officer sicknick wasn't murdered.  they are lying to you. that is provable. not a single person you just saw has apologized for lying. not a single one. and it's not just the news media. here's congressman pete aguilar of california claiming that officers lost their lives on january 6.  let's rally around the truth, he says, as he lies to you. may those words burn your tongue, liar. but what did happen exactly on january 6? what's the truth of that day? well, that's still unknown. from the extensive video we have of january 6, it's clear that some in the crowd, more than a few, were encouraging protesters to breach the capitol, to commit felonies. we're not guessing at that, we've showed you the tape.  we have pictures of their faces. in the case of a man called ray epps, we know his name, but they've never been charged. ray epps was standing in exactly the same place that a lot of people who went to jail were standing, but he wasn't charged. his name was taken off the fbi's most wanted list. why is that? it doesn't make any sense at all. the january 6 committee will not explain that after a year, millions of dollars and a thousand interviews. they won't tell us, nor will they tell us how many fbi agents and assets were in the crowd that day and what were they doing there. why can't we know that? and why are they still hiding thousands of hours of surveillance footage from within the capitol? if the point of the committee was to get the truth out there, why can't we see the tape?  why did authorities open the doors of the capitol to rioters and let them walk in, usher them in the doors? that's utterly bizarre. you saw that live. no one's ever explained it. what's the explanation for that? and by the way, whatever happened to the mysterious pipe bomber whose bombs we later learned many months later, kamala harris' bodyguards discovered. kamala harris told us she was at the capitol that day, but she wasn't. she was at the dnc with a pipe bomb outside. her bodyguards found that bomb, but she lied about that. she hid that. why?  that's got to be one of the weirdest stories ever. what does it mean, liz cheney? silence. and of course, above all, they lied about the reason that january 6 happened in the first place and you know what it is. the entire country watched joe biden get what they claim was 10 million more votes than barack obama himself got. joe biden got 10 million more votes than barack obama got, and a lot of those votes arrived after the election.  in a lot of places, voting was stopped in the middle of the night. why? in the biggest states in the country, voter id was optional. why is that okay? a lot of the protesters on january 6 were very upset about that and they should have been. all of us should be, but the january 6 committee ignored all of that completely. instead, on the basis of zero evidence, no evidence whatsoever, they blamed the entire riot on white supremacy. here's joe biden.  what? there's no evidence for that – none. the people at the capitol, including the ones who broke the law by entering the capitol, which is a crime, those people to a person said they were upset because they believed their democracy had been stolen from them and whether all of their claims are true or not, that's a valid reason to be upset. but rather than reassure the rest of us that actually our democracy is sound, elections are fair and transparent, there's no cheating and we can prove it, rather than do that, they call half the country names and not just names, the worst thing you can be called, a white supremacist. and then, most bewilderingly of all, virtually no republican in washington pushed back against any of that.  in fact, lindsey graham, violence worshiper to the end, said that his only regret was that the capitol police didn't shoot more trump voters in the neck and kill them. 'you've got guns, use them,' graham said. so here you have a sitting u.s. senator, a republican, urging police officers to shoot unarmed americans, many of whom were ushered into the capitol building by law enforcement.  how can people talk like that? for more than a year, they justified rhetoric like lindsey graham 'shoot more' by claiming that january 6 was an insurrection. that's not a word they were used to describe, say, the monthslong siege of a courthouse in portland, or the ongoing coordinated effort to intimidate supreme court justices at their homes with guns, a story they ignored today. but january 6 was different, they reminded us. it was unique because it was their offices and because it bothered nancy pelosi.  we are not defending and would never defend vandalism, violence, rioting. we disapproved of it when it happened. we disapprove of it now, all riots, not just this one. but this was not an insurrection. but, you know what will get you to insurrection? if you ignore the legitimate concerns of a population, if you brush them aside as if they don't matter when gas goes to $5 and you say 'buy an electric car.' when cities become so filthy and so dangerous that you can't live there, when the economy becomes so distorted that your own children have no hope of getting married and giving you grandchildren, when you don't care at all about any of that and all you do is talk about yourself, nonstop – you might get an insurrection if you behave like that, speaking of insurrection.",2022-06-09,-0.9996,Very Negative,"['news', 'host', 'tucker', 'carlson', 'gives',

'his gleeful support of violent white supremacists led to a breach of the capitol that put my life, and that of my colleagues, in grave danger. it is by the slimmest of luck that the outcome was not deadlier.

'the committee’s subpoena is invalid because, as explained below, the committee did not issue the subpoena to further a valid legislative purpose; the subpoena is unwarranted because other sources can provide the information the subpoena seeks; the subpoena is broader than reasonably necessary; the subpoena infringes on executive privilege; the subpoena infringes president trump’s first amendment rights; the committee is not duly authorized; and the committee lacks the authority to issue subpoenas,' the lawsuit said. brianna herlihy is a politics writer for fox news digital.",2022-11-14,-0.8221,Very Negative,"['panelists', 'weigh', 'january', 'committee', 'voting', 'subpoena', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'alleged', 'role', 'attack', 'capitol', 'staff', 'committee', 'declined', 'comment', 'say', 'nothing', 'friday', 'days', 'committee', 'wanted', 'appear', 'trump', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'members', 'committee', 'house', 'speaker', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'attempt', 'block', 'subpoena', 'called', 'lawsuit', 'trump', 'subpoena', 'loosely', 'worded', 'purpose', 'testimony', 'president', 'trump', 'necessary', 'purported', 'purpose', 'committee', 'subpoena', 'invalid', 'explained', 'committee', 'issue', 'subpoena', 'valid', 'legislative', 'purpose', 'subpoena', 'unwarranted', 'sources', 'provide', 'information', 'subpoena', 'seeks', 'subpoena', 'broader', 'reasonably', 'necessary', 'subpoena', 'infringes', 'executive', 'privilege', 'subpoena', 'infringes', 'president', 'trump', 'amendment', 'rights', 'committee', 'duly', 'authorized', 'committee', 'lacks', 'authority', 'issue', 'subpoenas', 'lawsuit', 'brianna', 'herlihy', 'politics', 'writer', 'news', 'digital']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-committee-white-house-phone-log-gap-hours,FOX,Jan. 6 committee probing 7.5 hour gap in White House phone logs,The House Jan. 6 committee is investigating more than seven-and-a-half hours of missing White House phone logs during the Capitol riot last year. ,"March 29, 2022 1:47pm EDT","fox news' capitol hill correspondent chad pergram provides updates on the house select committee's investigative hearings. the gap runs between 11:17 a.m. et and 6:54 p.m. et on jan. 6 during the heart of the capitol riot. the log issue was first reported by the washington post and cbs news. the department of justice declined to comment to fox news on the specific phone log gap. when asked monday about the overall jan. 6 investigation, deputy attorney general lisa monaco promised it would continue. 'let’s be very clear, we are going to continue to do those cases,' monaco said monday. 'we are going to hold those perpetrators accountable, no matter where the facts lead us at as the attorney general has said, no matter what level we will do those cases.' during the missing hours, trump attended a rally and spoke at the ellipse, a 52-acre park south of the white house fence. a crowd of people then moved to the u.s. capitol, overwhelming police and marauding through the building for hours before they were finally kicked out and the building was declared secure at about 5:30 p.m. more than 700 people have been arrested. the news comes a day after the jan. 6 committee adopted a report monday recommending that the house of representatives cite daniel scavino, jr., and peter navarro for criminal contempt of congress. both men worked in the white house as advisers to former president trump leading up to the jan. 6 riot and have dodged subpoenas for records and testimony, arguing that information is protected under executive privilege, a principle that normally applies to a president and his closest aides to make sure sensitive conversations stay private to protect the presidency and u.s. national security. at a select business meeting monday, jan. 6 committee chairman rep. bennie thompson, d-mass., argued that trump's former trade adviser, navarro, specifically has 'stonewalled' the committee's work by rejecting subpoenas despite sharing relevant details on tv and podcasts and in his own book and that president biden said executive privilege shouldn't prevent either man from cooperating with the select committee. 'they’re not fooling anybody. they are obligated to comply with our investigation. they have refused to do so. and that’s a crime,' thompson said. the meeting came after u.s. district court judge david carter said monday that trump 'likely' violated a federal obstruction statute as part of a ruling in the case of john eastman, former law school dean at chapman university, whose emails are being sought by the select committee. the committee subpoenaed scavino, trump’s former deputy chief of staff for communications, for information on his proximity to trump on the day of the riot, conversations about challenging the election results and any role in planning the rally at the ellipse. navarro is accused of promoting election fraud claims by working with former white house strategist stephen bannon to delay congress in certifying joe biden's victory. it’s unclear if the justice department will pursue charges if the house does act on the censure.the doj hasn’t acted on a contempt report from december for former white house chief of staff mark meadows, but bannon is scheduled to stand trial this summer and could be sentenced to up to two years in prison or fined up to $200,000 if convicted. last week, politico reported that a federal judge ordered the doj to produce internal records related to the decision to prosecute bannon, who maintained that he was legally not required to respond to subpoenas by the jan. 6 select committee. 'like mr. meadows, mr. navarro insists that he is above the law and is categorically and absolutely immune from any congressional subpoena regarding january 6th. we are aware of no court, anywhere in america, that has ever agreed with this proposition,' select committee vice chair, rep. liz cheney, r-wy., said. 'in this context, mr. navarro was not acting as a white house aide advising the president on official matters of policy.' 'he was acting as a trump campaign operative planning a political effort to obstruct or impede congress’s constitutional proceeding to count electoral votes,' she added. 'the department of justice is entrusted with the defense of our constitution. department leadership should not apply any doctrine of immunity that might block congress from fully uncovering and addressing the causes of the january 6th attack.' cheney also invoked the russian invasion of ukraine in relation to the work of the jan. 6 committee, saying 'democracy only survives if citizens are willing to defend it.' trump communicated with at least some lawmakers during the riot. he spoke, for example, with house republican leader kevin mccarthy, who asked him to call off the mob, according to republican rep. jaime lynn herrera beutler of washington state, who said mccarthy told her about the call. she said in a statement, 'that’s when, according to mccarthy, the president said, ‘well, kevin, i guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.’' republican sen. tommy tuberville of alabama also said he spoke with the president in that time period, telling reporters: 'i said, ’mr. president, they’ve taken the vice president out. they want me to get off the phone. i gotta go'.' that call by trump apparently first went to republican sen. mike lee of utah, who then handed the phone to tuberville. the committee has interviewed more than 500 witnesses, including more than a dozen former trump white house staff members, though many have refused to answer some questions by citing executive privilege. 'it’s important to note that even if a president has formally invoked executive privilege regarding testimony of a witness—which is not the case here—that witness has the obligation to sit down under oath and assert the privilege question by question,' thompson said monday of navarro and scavino. 'but these witnesses didn’t even bother to show up.' chad pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for fox news channel (fnc). he joined the network in september 2007 and is

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-counter-report-jan-6-security-failures-capitol,FOX,House Republicans release counter report on Jan. 6 security failures at Capitol,House Republicans have released a counter-report to the Jan. 6 committee's findings identifying security failures at the U.S. Capitol before the riot began.,"December 22, 2022 8:11am EST","rep. jim jordan discusses how the jan. 6 committee refers house republicans for ethics violations on ‘hannity.’ 'when speaker pelosi made the unprecedented decision to reject jim banks and jim jordan from sitting on thejanuary 6select committee — we knew she intended to play politics instead of addressing the massive security failures that lead to that day,' the lawmakers said in a statement. 'we said then that we would investigate and get to thebottom of why the capitol was left so unprepared that day, and what needs to be done to make sure our security apparatus is never left so unprepared again,' they added.'unsurprisingly, the select committee appears to have spent almost no time on this issue.we release the following report to answer these questions, and to lay groundwork for security reforms as we prepare to lead a safer and more secure campus in the 118thcongress and beyond.' 'to make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. uscp line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the capitol complex,' the report said. 'one officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on january 6, 2021 with nothing but his uscp-issued baseball cap. even if every uscp officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. the uscp was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.' republicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and uscp sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. additionally, the house investigators interviewed uscp chief tom manger, house sergeant at arms william walker, and the assistant director of the intelligence and interagency coordination division julie farnam. the investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings. 'the intelligence failures, coupled with the capitol police board’s failure to request national guard assistance prior to january 6th, meant the district of columbia national guard (dcng) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the capitol,' the senate report found. the committee released a 154-page executive summary of their findings on monday and referred criminal charges against trump to the justice department. 'what donald trump proceeded to do after the 2020 election is something no president had done before in our country,' said chairman bennie thompson, d-miss. 'in a staggering betrayal of his oath, donald trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy.' the panel argued during the committee's final meeting that trump's conduct before and after jan. 6 was 'unlawful.' lawmakers say they have sufficient evidence that trump obstructed an official proceeding of congress, conspired to defraud the federal government, made a false statement, and incited, assisted or aided an insurrection. over its 18-month tenure, the committee obtained access to tens of thousands of documents and conducted nearly 1,000 interviews related to the capitol protests. chris pandolfo is a writer for fox news digital. send tips to chris.pandolfo@fox.com and follow him on twitter @chriscpandolfo.",2022-12-22,-0.9775,Very Negative,"['jim', 'jordan', 'discusses', 'committee', 'refers', 'house', 'republicans', 'ethics', 'violations', 'speaker', 'pelosi', 'made', 'unprecedented', 'decision', 'reject', 'jim', 'banks', 'jim', 'jordan', 'sitting', 'thejanuary', 'committee', 'knew', 'intended', 'play', 'politics', 'instead', 'addressing', 'massive', 'security', 'failures', 'lead', 'day', 'lawmakers', 'statement', 'investigate', 'get', 'thebottom', 'capitol', 'left', 'unprepared', 'day', 'needs', 'done', 'make', 'sure', 'security', 'apparatus', 'never', 'left', 'unprepared', 'added', 'select', 'committee', 'appears', 'spent', 'almost', 'release', 'following', 'report', 'answer', 'questions', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'security', 'reforms', 'prepare', 'lead', 'safer', 'secure', 'campus', 'beyond', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'systemic', 'issues', 'crippled', 'security', 'apparatus', 'years', 'uscp', 'line', 'officers', 'protect', 'capitol', 'complex', 'report', 'officer', 'testified', 'investigators', 'went', 'fight', 'january', 'nothing', 'baseball', 'cap', 'even', 'every', 'uscp', 'officer', 'work', 'day', 'numbers', 'still', 'insufficient', 'hold', 'rioters', 'due', 'lack', 'training', 'equipment', 'uscp', 'set', 'fail', 'scant', 'signs', 'progress', 'toward', 'addressing', 'weaknesses', 'republicans', 'evidence', 'gathered', 'report', 'came', 'witnesses', 'uscp', 'sources', 'whose', 'identities', 'protected', 'fear', 'retaliation', 'additionally', 'house', 'investigators', 'interviewed', 'uscp', 'chief', 'tom', 'manger', 'house', 'sergeant', 'arms', 'william', 'walker', 'assistant', 'director', 'intelligence', 'interagency', 'coordination', 'division', 'julie', 'farnam', 'investigation', 'relied', 'public', 'documents', 'news', 'reports', 'supplement', 'findings', 'intelligence', 'failures', 'coupled', 'capitol', 'police', 'board', 'failure', 'request', 'national', 'guard', 'assistance', 'prior', 'january', 'meant', 'district', 'columbia', 'national', 'guard', 'dcng', 'activated', 'staged', 'prepared', 'quickly', 'respond', 'attack', 'capitol', 'senate', 'report', 'found', 'committee', 'released', 'executive', 'summary', 'findings', 'monday', 'referred', 'criminal', 'charges', 'trump', 'justice', 'department', 'donald', 'trump', 'proceeded', 'election', 'something', 'president', 'done', 'country', 'chairman', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'staggering', 'betrayal', 'oath', 'donald', 'trump', 'attempted', 'plan', 'led', 'attack', 'pillar', 'democracy', 'panel', 'argued', 'committee', 'final', 'meeting', 'trump', 'conduct', 'lawmakers', 'say', 'sufficient', 'evidence', 'trump', 'obstructed', 'official', 'proceeding', 'congress', 'conspired', 'defraud', 'federal', 'government', 'made', 'false', 'statement', 'incited', 'assisted', 'aided', 'insurrection', 'tenure', 'committee', 'obtained', 'access', 'tens', 'thousands', 'documents', 'conducted', 'nearly', 'interviews', 'related', 'capitol', 'protests', 'chris', 'pandolfo', 'writer', 'news', 'digital', 'send', 'tips', 'follow', 'twitter', 'chriscpandolfo']"

'i’m going to go to jail, and i’m going to be happy,' the speaker added. the new footage, recorded by filmmaker alexandra pelosi, the speaker’s daughter, was released during the house jan. 6 committee hearing on thursday afternoon. cnn later released more context to the clip during a segment on cnn’s 'anderson cooper 360.' at the time of pelosi’s remarks, trump was holding a rally at the ellipse, about two miles away from the capitol. during the rally, trump said he would join his supporters at the capitol, where lawmakers were officializing the presidential election results. trump ultimately did not join those who marched on the capitol, which swiftly turned into a riot. 'what donald trump proceeded to do after the 2020 election is something no president has done before in our country,' thompson said during his opening statements at the hearing. 'in a staggering betrayal of his oath, donald trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy. it’s still hard to believe. 'but the facts and testimony are clear, consistent, and undisputed,' he contended. witnesses who appeared before the committee were not cross-examined. in a surprising move, the committee also unanimously voted to subpoena trump to testify. taking to truth social, trump — who has been routinely critical of the committee and its investigation — called it a 'total bust' and said the committee’s purpose was only 'to further divide' the country. the president teased this same information in another social media post. 'why didn’t crazy nancy pelosi call out the ‘troops’ before january 6th, which i strongly recommended that she do. it was her responsibility, but she ‘didn’t like the look.’ crazy nancy failed the american people!' he wrote thursday afternoon. in an exclusive interview with fox news digital on thursday, trump slammed the committee and its investigation as a 'witch hunt.'

'no,' one responded swiftly, while another explained, 'he died of a heart attack.' another voter said, 'it was a stroke.' she added, 'that’s not on-site,' referencing the death of capitol police officer brian sicknick, who died from a stroke one day after allegedly being pepper-sprayed by rioters at the capitol building. switching gears, jordan asked the group what they thought of the riot in general, which she called 'pretty disturbing.' she also mentioned the vandalism and 'people throwing excrement at the walls.' the voter added, 'anybody who harms anybody, anybody who caused property destruction, that needs to be dealt with. but if you’re there making your voice heard at the people’s house no less, that’s again, it’s a fundamental constitutional right of an american citizen. and people should not be being held political prisoner because of it.' the female voter chimed it, 'for misdemeanors. that’s east germany tactics.' the male voter then said, 'our administration, i feel like, is using it as their reichstag fire. that’s exactly what they’re using it as.' jordan also asked about trump’s involvement in the riot, asking, 'do you think that president trump could have quelled the violence that day?' the collection of responses included, 'no,' and 'i don’t think so.' another female voter noted, 'it started when he was still speaking.' that voter noted she attended trump’s speech that day to see him speak one last time, prompting another female to ask her, 'so did he tell everybody to go and start rioting?' 'no,' the first lady replied, to which the second said, 'i didn’t think so.' they both stressed that trump asked the crowds to protest at the capitol 'peacefully.' others repeated the charge from some voices on the right that speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., bore some responsibility for the melee for not beefing up security more at the capitol. reacting to the focus group on monday, msnbc's joe scarborough said the voters had been 'lied to' or 'duped' into believing the day was mostly peaceful. on the right, the federalist's mollie hemingway called the voters 'legitimately impressive,' saying they had not fallen for a 'propaganda press narrative,' in response to a clip of the segment. the committee did not ask trump to appear for an open hearing. trump was impeached in the house of representatives on a count of inciting an insurrection in 2021 but acquitted in the u.s. senate for his actions around jan. 6. gabriel hays is an associate editor for fox news digital.",2022-10-25,-0.9873,Very Negative,"['group', 'trump', 'voters', 'debated', 'msnbc', 'analyst', 'elise', 'jordan', 'january', 'narrative', 'joe', 'segment', 'aired', 'monday', 'january', 'narrative', 'aired', 'monday', 'msnbc', 'began', 'jordan', 'asking', 'group', 'whether', 'republican', 'pennsylvania', 'gubernatorial', 'candidate', 'doug', 'mastriano', 'restricted', 'areas', 'capitol', 'grounds', 'male', 'voter', 'questioned', 'claim', 'immediately', 'asking', 'area', 'saw', 'video', 'capitol', 'officers', 'taking', 'away', 'barriers', 'unlocking', 'doors', 'people', 'several', 'others', 'seated', 'agreed', 'another', 'man', 'added', 'opened', 'gates', 'jordan', 'disqualifying', 'elected', 'official', 'participate', 'january', 'either', 'shook', 'heads', 'audibly', 'responded', 'died', 'protestor', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'another', 'voter', 'elaborated', 'unarmed', 'female', 'shot', 'police', 'female', 'voter', 'declared', 'died', 'jordan', 'rebutted', 'claim', 'stating', 'police', 'officer', 'die', 'received', 'pushback', 'responded', 'swiftly', 'another', 'explained', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'another', 'voter', 'stroke', 'added', 'referencing', 'death', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'brian', 'sicknick', 'died', 'stroke', 'day', 'allegedly', 'rioters', 'capitol', 'building', 'switching', 'gears', 'jordan', 'asked', 'group', 'thought', 'riot', 'general', 'called', 'disturbing', 'mentioned', 'vandalism', 'throwing', 'excrement', 'walls', 'voter', 'added', 'harms', 'anybody', 'anybody', 'caused', 'property', 'destruction', 'needs', 'dealt', 'making', 'voice', 'heard', 'people', 'house', 'less', 'fundamental', 'constitutional', 'right', 'american', 'citizen', 'people', 'held', 'political', 'prisoner', 'female', 'voter', 'chimed', 'misdemeanors', 'east', 'germany', 'tactics', 'male', 'voter', 'administration', 'feel', 'like', 'using', 'reichstag', 'fire', 'exactly', 'using', 'jordan', 'asked', 'trump', 'involvement', 'riot', 'asking', 'think', 'president', 'trump', 'quelled', 'violence', 'day', 'collection', 'responses', 'included', 'think', 'another', 'female', 'voter', 'noted', 'started', 'still', 'speaking', 'voter', 'noted', 'attended', 'trump', 'speech', 'day', 'see', 'speak', 'last', 'prompting', 'another', 'female', 'ask', 'tell', 'everybody', 'go', 'start', 'rioting', 'lady', 'replied', 'second', 'think', 'stressed', 'trump', 'asked', 'crowds', 'protest', 'capitol', 'others', 'repeated', 'charge', 'voices', 'right', 'speaker', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'bore', 'responsibility', 'melee', 'beefing', 'security', 'capitol', 'reacting', 'focus', 'group', 'monday', 'msnbc', 'joe', 'scarborough', 'voters', 'believing', 'day', 'mostly', 'peaceful', 'right', 'federalist', 'mollie', 'hemingway', 'called', 'voters', 'impressive', 'saying', 'fallen', 'press', 'narrative', 'response', 'clip', 'segment', 'committee', 'ask', 'trump', 'appear', 'open', 'hearing', 'trump', 'impeached', 'house', 'representatives', 'count', 'inciting', 'insurrection', 'acquitted', 'senate', 'actions', 'around', 'gabriel', 'hays', 'associate', 'editor', 'news', 'digital']"

'it was clear he had decided to be a part of the problem,' pence said. 'i was determined to be part of the solution.' pence did make a point to say that the following day, trump pulled back and moved toward the peaceful transfer of power. he then noted a shift in trump's attitude during a private meeting the two had five days after the riot. 'i walked into that back room and the president looked up at me and i sensed he was deeply remorseful about what had happened,' pence recalled. he said trump immediately asked how pence's family was doing. 'i responded sternly, ‘they’re fine mr. president,'' pence said. the former vice president said trump asked him if he had been scared on january 6. 'i said no, iwas angry. i was angry about our differences andi was infuriated at what i saw that day,' pence said. 'in that moment he seemed genuinely remorseful.' besides being remorseful about what pence went through, trump appeared to also harbor regrets over the events of that day in general. 'the president lamented what had happened,' pence recalled. 'he said what if we hadn’t had the rally. it’s so terrible to end like this.' looking ahead, pence said republicans need to keep their eyes on the future and not get bogged down in the past. he said candidates in the midterm elections who did this performed well, and those who focused on re-litigating the 2020 election performed poorly.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/capitol-riot-history-battle-january-legacy,FOX,The Capitol riot and revisionist history: the battle over the Jan. 6 legacy,Donald Trump sued Congress and the National Archives to block the release of any documents related to January 6th on grounds of executive privilege. A Democratic-led committee argues this is obstructionism and that nothing could be more important than investigating an attack on American democracy.,"October 20, 2021 3:26am EDT","mediabuzz host howard kurtz discusses president biden's stance on doj prosecutions of former trump officials that was then. trump, obviously, has been leading the effort at revisionist history battle. so it’s easy to ascribe the current stance of many republican politicians as just not wanting the cross the party’s de facto leader and possible 2024 nominee. but what’s happening is deeper than that, underlining the two clashing realities that dominate american politics today. the belief that jan. 6 was a righteous cause that somehow went awry requires an equally strong belief that the 2020 election was in fact stolen from trump—as he argues virtually every day, despite the investigations and lawsuits to the contrary. more than half the country, and the vast majority of the media, see that as ridiculous, but polls indicate that for many republicans it has become an article of faith. the atlantic likens trump’s crusade to the confederacy, which of course mounted an armed rebellion against the united states largely to uphold the evils of slavery. and yet the politicians and generals who led that effort in secession have been venerated in the south for generations—until recent years, when the tide shifted and the statues started to come down. 'the new lost cause, like the old one, seeks to convert a shameful catastrophe into a celebration of the valor and honor of the culprits and portray those who attacked the country as the true patriots,' the piece says. 'but lost causes have a pernicious tendency to be less lost than we might hope. just as neo-confederate revisionism shaped racial violence and oppression after the war, trump’s new lost cause poses a continuing peril to the hope of ‘one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’' author david graham allows that it was awful for ashli babbitt to have been fatally shot by a police officer as she tried to break into the house chamber. trump has been celebrating her and recently mentioned her birthday. but while lost causes may have their martyrs, says the magazine, ticking off historical examples, the problem is that 'they emphasize the valor of the people involved while whitewashing what they were doing.' the soldiers of the confederacy 'might well have been brave, and they might well have been good fathers, brothers, and sons, but they died in service of a treasonous war to preserve the institution of slavery, and that is why their actions do not deserve celebration. the january 6 insurrection was an attempt to subvert the constitution and steal an election.' politico examines the situation more at the ground-game level.  weeks after the riot, the democratic legislative campaign committee ran digital ads in three states with this narration of the images of destruction: 'republican legislators fanned the flames. some were even there.' 'his street cred went up,' the senate’s democratic leader admitted. 'there’s no question.' the dlcc went after 21 lawmakers who were either at the trump rally or with the capitol protesters, and 600 others who signed letters or otherwise promoted 'stop the steal' rhetoric. but the democratic group misread the mood of the gop: 'rather than shaming republican state lawmakers out of office, democrats found that many of the names on the list avoided pushback from party leaders in their state, grew their political platform and online following, and in at least three cases are now running for statewide office.' history, it is said, is written by the winners. but in this case, those who lost the campaign to overturn the election, and have minimized jan. 6, have convinced a whole lot of americans of their version.",2021-10-20,-0.9969,Very Negative,"['mediabuzz', 'host', 'howard', 'kurtz', 'discusses', 'president', 'biden', 'stance', 'doj', 'prosecutions', 'former', 'trump', 'officials', 'trump', 'obviously', 'leading', 'effort', 'revisionist', 'history', 'battle', 'easy', 'ascribe', 'current', 'stance', 'many', 'republican', 'politicians', 'wanting', 'cross', 'party', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'possible', 'nominee', 'happening', 'deeper', 'underlining', 'clashing', 'realities', 'dominate', 'american', 'politics', 'today', 'belief', 'righteous', 'cause', 'somehow', 'went', 'awry', 'requires', 'equally', 'strong', 'belief', 'election', 'fact', 'stolen', 'argues', 'virtually', 'every', 'day', 'despite', 'investigations', 'lawsuits', 'contrary', 'half', 'country', 'vast', 'majority', 'media', 'see', 'ridiculous', 'polls', 'indicate', 'many', 'republicans', 'become', 'article', 'faith', 'atlantic', 'likens', 'trump', 'crusade', 'confederacy', 'course', 'mounted', 'armed', 'rebellion', 'united', 'states', 'largely', 'uphold', 'evils', 'slavery', 'yet', 'politicians', 'generals', 'led', 'effort', 'secession', 'venerated', 'south', 'recent', 'years', 'tide', 'shifted', 'statues', 'started', 'come', 'new', 'lost', 'cause', 'like', 'old', 'seeks', 'convert', 'shameful', 'catastrophe', 'celebration', 'valor', 'honor', 'culprits', 'portray', 'attacked', 'country', 'true', 'patriots', 'piece', 'says', 'lost', 'causes', 'pernicious', 'tendency', 'less', 'lost', 'might', 'hope', 'revisionism', 'shaped', 'racial', 'violence', 'oppression', 'war', 'trump', 'new', 'lost', 'cause', 'poses', 'continuing', 'peril', 'hope', 'nation', 'god', 'indivisible', 'liberty', 'justice', 'author', 'david', 'graham', 'allows', 'awful', 'ashli', 'babbitt', 'fatally', 'shot', 'police', 'officer', 'tried', 'break', 'house', 'chamber', 'trump', 'celebrating', 'recently', 'mentioned', 'birthday', 'lost', 'causes', 'may', 'martyrs', 'says', 'magazine', 'ticking', 'historical', 'examples', 'problem', 'emphasize', 'valor', 'people', 'involved', 'whitewashing', 'soldiers', 'confederacy', 'well', 'brave', 'might', 'well', 'good', 'fathers', 'brothers', 'sons', 'died', 'service', 'treasonous', 'war', 'preserve', 'institution', 'slavery', 'actions', 'deserve', 'celebration', 'january', 'insurrection', 'attempt', 'subvert', 'constitution', 'steal', 'election', 'politico', 'examines', 'situation', 'level', 'weeks', 'riot', 'democratic', 'legislative', 'campaign', 'committee', 'ran', 'digital', 'ads', 'three', 'states', 'narration', 'images', 'destruction', 'legislators', 'fanned', 'flames', 'even', 'street', 'cred', 'went', 'senate', 'democratic', 'leader', 'admitted', 'question', 'dlcc', 'went', 'lawmakers', 'either', 'trump', 'rally', 'capitol', 'protesters', 'others', 'signed', 'letters', 'otherwise', 'promoted', 'steal', 'rhetoric', 'democratic', 'group', 'misread', 'mood', 'gop', 'shaming', 'republican', 'state', 'lawmakers', 'office', 'democrats', 'found', 'many', 'names', 'list', 'avoided', 'pushback', 'party', 'leaders', 'state', 'grew', 'political', 'platform', 'online', 'following', 'least', 'three', 'cases', 'running', 'statewide', 'office', 'history', 'written', 'winners', 'case', 'lost', 'campaign', 'overturn', 'election', 'minimized', 'convinced', 'whole', 'lot', 'americans', 'version']"

'nothing like this has happened. what that ‘unselect committee’ is doing and what the people are doing who are running those prisons is a disgrace. it's a disgrace. we will treat them fairly.' a little over a year ago, lawmakers were forced to evacuate the u.s. capitol and temporarily suspend the certification of the electoral college results as rioters plowed through police perimeters and breached the building and occupied it for several hours. 'everyone in washington is obsessing over how to protect ukraine’s border—but the most important border in the world is not ukraine’s border, it’s america’s border but let people come in and we have no idea who they are,' trump said. 'the first duty of the american president is to defend the american border.' 'before joe biden sends any troops to defend a border in eastern europe he should be sending troops to defend our border right here in texas,' he continued. cameron cawthorne is a politics editor for fox news digital. story tips can be sent to cameron.cawthorne@fox.com and on twitter: @cam_cawthorne",2022-01-30,0.1385,Neutral,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'thing', 'many', 'people', 'asking', 'run', 'win', 'treat', 'people', 'fairly', 'trump', 'eliciting', 'applause', 'treat', 'fairly', 'requires', 'pardons', 'give', 'pardons', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'happened', 'atrocities', 'took', 'place', 'recently', 'trump', 'continued', 'appearing', 'talk', 'crime', 'across', 'united', 'states', 'like', 'happened', 'unselect', 'committee', 'people', 'running', 'prisons', 'disgrace', 'disgrace', 'treat', 'fairly', 'little', 'year', 'ago', 'lawmakers', 'forced', 'evacuate', 'capitol', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'certification', 'electoral', 'college', 'results', 'rioters', 'plowed', 'police', 'perimeters', 'breached', 'building', 'occupied', 'several', 'hours', 'washington', 'obsessing', 'protect', 'ukraine', 'important', 'border', 'world', 'ukraine', 'border', 'america', 'border', 'people', 'come', 'idea', 'trump', 'duty', 'american', 'president', 'defend', 'american', 'border', 'joe', 'biden', 'sends', 'troops', 'defend', 'border', 'eastern', 'europe', 'sending', 'troops', 'defend', 'border', 'right', 'texas', 'continued', 'cameron', 'cawthorne', 'politics', 'editor', 'news', 'digital', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-prime-time-jan-6-committee-hearing,FOX,What’s at stake for Democrats in the primetime Capitol riot committee hearing,"Riveting new information on the Capitol protests aside, the Jan. 6 committee's strategic scheduling for Thursday's Congressional hearings aims to draw in voters.","June 8, 2022 1:14pm EDT","fox news congressional correspondent chad pergram discusses text messages allegedly from former white house chief of staff mark meadows on ‘special report.’ everyone piled on board a luxurious, massive, tricked-out, nuclear-fueled, passenger locomotive. passengers rolled across the country on board a train complete with swimming pools, a disco and a shopping mall. 'snowpiercer,' this wasn’t. the elaborate sets were costly. the ratings were anemic. nbc canceled supertrain after ten episodes. television historians generally rank supertrain as one of the most prodigious flops in network history. at a senate judiciary committee hearing on tuesday morning, robert pape of the university of chicago laid out the problem facing democrats heading into thursday’s hearing. 'donald trump is now more powerful because of january 6 than he would have been without january 6,' testified pape. political observers from both sides are keenly watching to see what impact the 1/6 committee hearings have. it’s unclear if the hearings can move the meter in the court of public opinion as democrats hope they will. so, some questions: do the hearings reveal seismic revelations which dramatically alter the course of american politics and what we understand about the riot so far? do the hearings simply confirm what opponents of former president trump suspected all along? do mr. trump’s loyalists harden their backing of him? are the hearings preaching to the converted? does anyone watch? do americans care —despite the mayhem which unfolded on capitol hill that day and the potential to upend the electoral college votes? the committee has probed the role of the former president and those close to him in the months between election day, 2020, and january 6, 2021. democrats —and the two gopers who serve on the panel, reps. liz cheney, r-wy., and adam kinzinger, r-ill. —hope the hearings will show just how much peril democracy faced that day. if they’re going to break through to skeptical voters or those still aligned with the former president, the 1/6 committee needs a game changer. this is augmented by the fact that the views of people about the riot break down along party lines. this is why the committee is exhausting a lot of time and effort on the stagecraft of thursday’s hearing. for starters, the committee is holding the hearing in primetime. that’s an effort to command as wide a tv audience as possible. 'evening' congressional hearings are rare. granted, some high-profile hearings always garner lots of coverage. tv networks cleared their schedules for the hearing with former fbi director james comey in june, 2017. but that hearing was during the day. the same with the 2013 hearing with former secretary of state hillary clinton on benghazi. but again, the hearing was during the day. tv networks also went deep into the mccarthy 'red scare' hearings of the mid-1950s, the senate watergate hearings in 1973 and the iran-contra hearings in 1987. but none were 'scheduled' for primetime. most confirmation hearings for supreme court nominees feature at least one day which bleeds into the evening. the most recent example of scheduled evening hearings came in 2014. the house veterans’ affairs committee conducted a number of evening hearings in 2014 in an effort to shed light on problems at the va and the manipulation of records. in order to help with that, the committee signed up former abc news president james goldston to help 'produce' the hearing. to be successful, the 1/6 committee needs some sort of breakthrough with the public via these hearings. it’s unclear if that will happen. the testimony of special counsel robert mueller before the house judiciary and intelligence committees in july, 2019 was one of the most anticipated congressional hearings in years. however, mueller’s testimony was sluggish. mueller repeatedly told lawmakers that his report 'speaks for itself.' or, that the report constituted his 'testimony.' at a press conference the day after mueller’s session, i asked rep. eric swalwell, d-calif., what did robert mueller 'fail to do?' swalwell argued that mueller 'didn’t fail to do anything.' yours truly followed up that democrats were privately frustrated that mueller 'failed to breathe life into that report.' 'well, if you showed up, expecting a broadway show, sure,' replied swalwell. and therein lies the rub. january 6 was a dark day. but many americans have moved on. politically, they’re concerned more about inflation, gas prices and baby formula than the riot. to change the narrative, the committee must re-animate january 6 for the public. make it a primetime blockbuster. or, at the very least, a 'broadway show.' 'we're not in the business of entertainment,' said rep. jamie raskin, d-md., a member of the 1/6 committee. 'we're in the business of trying to communicate to the american people, the gravity and the immensity of these events.' the committee may have lot of damning, harrowing information to share. but it may not matter unless the committee grabs the attention of voters. chad pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for fox news channel (fnc). he joined the network in september

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-biden-speech-trump-democracy,FOX,"Biden in Jan. 6 speech sharply criticizes Trump as spreading 'web of lies,' stoking riot","President Biden on Thursday blamed former President Donald Trump for stoking insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and spreading a ""web of lies"" in order to ""prevent"" the peaceful transfer of power.","January 6, 2022 12:10pm EST","fox news anchor bret baier reacts to the tone of the president's speech marking one year since the capitol riot. 'our constitution faced the gravest of threats,' biden said. 'outnumbered in the face of a brutal attack, the capitol police, the d.c. metropolitan police, the national guard and brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.' 'our democracy held. we the people endured. we the people prevailed,' biden said. biden, quickly, shifted to trump – never mentioning him by name, but instead, referring to him only as 'the former president.' 'for the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election. he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the capitol,' biden said. 'but they failed.' biden added that americans 'must make sure this never, never happens again.' biden pointed to clio, the statue of the muse of history, which overlooks statuary hall, noting that she documents the events of congressional history in the journal she holds. 'clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. she recorded what took place – the real history, the real facts, the real truth,' biden said. 'the bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. we shall know the truth.' 'well here is the god's truth of jan. 6, 2021,' biden continued. 'go back to that day. what do you see? rioters rampaging, waving, for the first time inside the capitol, confederate flags that symbolize the cause to destroy america – to rip us apart. even during the civil war, that never happened. but it happened here, in 2021.' 'a mob, breaking windows, kicking in doors,' biden continued, recalling individuals using 'american flags on poles' as 'weapons, as spears.' but biden went on to invoke trump again – noting that he 'had just rallied the mob to attack,' and watched the riot on television, and did 'nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives were at risk, the nation's capitol under siege.' biden said the rioters were 'not looking to uphold the will of the people,' but instead, 'looking to deny the will of the people,' and 'overturn' a 'free and fair election.' the president noted that his speech thursday was 'about making sure the past isn’t buried.' pointing again to trump, biden said he 'created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.' 'he has done so because he values power over principle; he sees his own interest as more important than america’s interest; his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our constitution,' biden said. 'he can’t accept he lost, even though that’s what 93 u.s. senators, his own attorney general, his own vice president, governors, state officials in every battleground state, have all said. he lost,' biden said. 'he has done what no president in the history of this country has ever done. he refused to accept results of an election and the will of the american people,' biden said. pointing to members of the republican party who are loyal to trump, biden said 'they seem to no longer want to be the party of lincoln, eisenhower, reagan or the bushes.' biden claimed that some republicans are working with trump to continue to tell 'the big lie, and claimed that they 'fear his wrath.' 'the big lie being told by the former president and many republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on nov. 3, 2020,' biden said. 'they want you to see election day as the day of insurrection.' he added: 'can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at america? i cannot.' 'at this moment, we must decide what kind of nation are we going to be?' biden declared. 'will we be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? are we going to be a nation wherewe allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?' biden went on to slam new election laws in republican-led states across the nation – but did not name the states to which he was referring. 'the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' biden said. 'it is wrong. it is undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-american.' again defending the results of the 2020 presidential election, biden said that 'no election in american history has been more closely scrutinized.' 'every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country was made and was rejected,' biden said, noting that, often times, republican-appointed judges rejected the challenges. biden went on to claim that 'even before the first ballot was cast,' trump 'was preemptively sowing lies about the vote,' saying they were not 'based on facts,' but instead was trump’s effort to look 'for a pre-text to cover for the truth.' 'he is not just a former president. he is a defeated president,' biden said. 'you can’t love your country only when you win. you can’t obey the law only when it is convenient. you can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies,' biden said. 'those who stormed this capitol and those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of america and american democracy.' biden, shifting back to insurrectionists, said they 'didn’t come here out of patriotism or principle.' 'they came here in rage. not in service of america, but rather, in service of one man,' biden said. 'those who incited the mob, the real plotters who were desperate to deny the certification of this election, defied the will of the voters. but their plot was foiled.' he added: 'congress finished the work, honored their oath to defend the constitution, against all enemies – foreign and domestic.' looking ahead, biden said the united states is 'at an inflection point in history both at home and abroad,' warning that america is 'engaged in a new struggle between democracy and autocracy.' the president said that 'from china, russia and beyond, they are betting that democracy’s days are numbered' and that america 'will become more like them and less like us.' 'they are betting that america is the place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman,' biden said. 'i do not believe that. that is not who we are, that is not who we have ever been, and that is not who we will ever, ever be.' the president said he is 'crystal clear' about the 'threats' america faces, urging americans to 'step up' and 'write the next chapter in american history where jan. 6 marked not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.' 'i believe the power of the presidency and purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it. to lift us up, not tear us apart,' biden said at the close of his remarks. 'to make it about us. not about me.' biden urged americans to 'remember together that we are one nation, under god, indivisible, and that today and tomorrow and forever, at our best, we are the united states of america.' days after the riot in january 2021, the house of representatives introduced an article of impeachment against trump saying he 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the government of the united states.' the article alleged that before jan. 6, the joint session of congress to certify the presidential election results, trump 'repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the american people or certified by state or federal officials.' the article claimed that before the jan. 6 joint session of congress, the president addressed a crowd and reiterated 'false claims,' claiming that his remarks 'encouraged--and forseeably resulted in--lawless action at the capitol.' the house of representatives voted on jan. 13, 2021, to impeach trump. the senate, in february 2021, voted in favor of his acquittal. trump was the first president in u.s. history to be impeached twice, and the first president out of office to go through an impeachment proceeding. meanwhile, in a statement shortly after biden concluded his remarks thursday, trump slammed biden saying he is 'working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the borders, covid, inflation, loss of energy independence, and much more.' 'everything he touches turns to failure,' trump said, repeating his unproven claims that the election was 'rigged.' brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at

'i made it clear i did not agree with the idea that the election was stolen, which, i told the president, was bulls--t,' barr said during his deposition. 'and you know, i didn't want to be a part of it, and that's one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when i did.' barr added that: 'you can't live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election--that there was fraud in the election.' committee vice chair liz cheney, r-wyo., also presented video testimony from ivanka trump on barr’s statement that the justice department found 'no fraud sufficient to overturn the election.' during the video, ivanka trump was asked how barr's statement affected her perspective of the election. 'it affected my perspective,' she testified. 'i respect attorney general barr, so, i accepted what he was saying.' trump, taking aim at his daughter on truth social friday morning, said she 'was not involved in looking at, or studying election results.' 'she had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to bill barr and his position as attorney general (he sucked!)' trump posted. trump also slammed barr as a 'coward' and as a 'weak and frightened attorney general who was always being ‘played’ and threatened by the democrats and was scared stiff of being impeached.' trump’s reaction comes after committee chairman bennie thompson, d-miss., in his opening statement, said trump 'was at the center of this conspiracy.' 'ultimately, donald trump, the president of the united states, spurred a mob of domestic enemies..to march down the capitol and subvert american democracy,' thompson said. cheney, during the hearing, said 'there is no room for debate.' 'those who invaded our capitol and battled law enforcement for hours were motivated by what president trump had told them--that the election was stolen and that he was the rightful president,' cheney said. 'president trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.' the select committee played a never-before-seen video of graphic events that transpired during the jan. 6, 2021 attack on the capitol. thompson, before playing the tape, warned that it 'is hard to watch.' meanwhile, cheney said that there is 'no doubt that president trump was well aware of the violence as it developed.' 'white house staff urged president trump to intervene and call off the mob,' cheney said, presenting a document written by a member of the white house staff 'advising what the president needed to say' while the attack was underway at the capitol. 'anyone who entered the capitol without proper authority should leave immediately,' the note cheney presented read. 'this is exactly what his supporters on capitol hill and nationwide were urging the president to do. he would not.' cheney also pointed to congressional leaders who 'begged' trump for help, including republican leader kevin mccarthy, who was ''scared' and called multiple members of president trump's family after he could not persuade the president himself.' 'not only did president trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the capitol, he placed no call to any element of the united states government to instruct that the capitol be defended,' cheney said. 'trump did not call his secretary of defense on january 6th. he did not talk to his attorney general. he did not talk to the department of homeland security.' 'president trump gave no order to deploy the national guard that day, and he made no effort to work with the department of justice to coordinate and display and deploy law enforcement assets,' cheney said. cheney, though, said then-vice president mike pence did contact the pentagon for assets to protect the capitol. cheney played audio of testimony from chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley, who said pence 'was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders--there was no question about that.' milley said pence urged then-defense secretary christopher miller to 'get military down here, get the guard down here, put down this situation.' in contrast, milley shared details of his conversation with then-white house chief of staff mark meadows. 'he said, we have, we have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions,' milley testified meadows said. 'we need to establish the narrative that, you know, that the president is still in charge and that things are steady or stable.' milley added: 'that's something-- i immediately interpret that as politics, politics, politics. red flag for me personally.' thursday's hearing was just the first of seven televised hearings expected in the coming weeks. the next hearings have already been announced for monday and wednesday of next week. brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",2022-06-10,-0.9818,Very

'i believed we were supposed to be the leaders of the country, of the right wing,' bertino said. 'the tip of the spear.' bertino is the second former proud boys member to testify at the trial. the first, matthew greene, testified in january that group members were growing increasingly angry about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and were expecting a 'civil war.' bertino pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in october 2022 and agreed to cooperate with the justice department’s investigation. he hasn't been sentenced yet. bertino wasn't in washington when the capitol riot began. he was stabbed in an altercation in downtown d.c. after a proud boys march on dec. 12, 2021, and was still recovering on jan. 6. tarrio wasn’t in washington on jan. 6, either. police arrested him in d.c. two days before the capitol riot and charged him with vandalizing a black lives matter banner at a historic black church during a december 2020 protest. tarrio heeded a judge's order to leave the city after his arrest. danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police and more. story tips can be sent to danielle.wallace@fox.com and on twitter: @danimwallace.",2023-02-23,-0.9909,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'ask', 'government', 'assistance', 'serving', 'trump', 'pattis', 'added', 'throughout', 'trial', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'suggested', 'trump', 'responsible', 'encouraging', 'clients', 'crowd', 'others', 'capitol', 'disrupt', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'certifying', 'joe', 'biden', 'election', 'victory', 'pattis', 'remarks', 'indicate', 'defense', 'directly', 'confirmed', 'plans', 'subpoena', 'trump', 'news', 'digital', 'reached', 'pattis', 'office', 'trump', 'team', 'separately', 'wednesday', 'hear', 'back', 'publication', 'jeremy', 'bertino', 'former', 'proud', 'boy', 'plead', 'guilty', 'seditious', 'conspiracy', 'charge', 'stemming', 'riot', 'testifying', 'tarrio', 'biggs', 'ethan', 'nordean', 'zachary', 'rehl', 'dominic', 'pezzola', 'trial', 'scheduled', 'resume', 'wednesday', 'testimony', 'bertino', 'trial', 'recessed', 'tuesday', 'prosecutor', 'began', 'questioning', 'bertino', 'attack', 'election', 'bertino', 'viewed', 'proud', 'boys', 'leaders', 'conservative', 'movement', 'perspective', 'fueled', 'regular', 'viewership', 'infowars', 'website', 'believed', 'supposed', 'leaders', 'country', 'right', 'wing', 'bertino', 'tip', 'spear', 'bertino', 'second', 'former', 'proud', 'boys', 'member', 'testify', 'trial', 'matthew', 'greene', 'testified', 'january', 'group', 'members', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'angry', 'outcome', 'presidential', 'election', 'expecting', 'war', 'bertino', 'pleaded', 'guilty', 'seditious', 'conspiracy', 'october', 'agreed', 'cooperate', 'justice', 'department', 'investigation', 'sentenced', 'yet', 'bertino', 'washington', 'capitol', 'riot', 'began', 'stabbed', 'altercation', 'downtown', 'proud', 'boys', 'march', 'still', 'recovering', 'tarrio', 'washington', 'either', 'police', 'arrested', 'days', 'capitol', 'riot', 'charged', 'vandalizing', 'black', 'lives', 'matter', 'banner', 'historic', 'black', 'church', 'december', 'protest', 'tarrio', 'heeded', 'judge', 'order', 'leave', 'city', 'arrest', 'danielle', 'wallace', 'reporter', 'news', 'digital', 'covering', 'politics', 'crime', 'police', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter', 'danimwallace']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-committee-thursdays-hearing-focus-trumps-pressure-pence-overturn-electoral-college-votes,FOX,Jan. 6 Committee: Thursday's hearing to focus on Trump's pressure on Pence to overturn electoral college votes,The Jan. 6 Select Committee's third public hearing will focus on Trump and his allies' pressure on Pence to overturn valid electoral votes.,"June 16, 2022 6:14am EDT","rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., describes how he sees former president donald trump's role in the capitol riot and if it looks criminal to him on 'your world.' 'the select committee will examine president trump's relentless effort on january 6 and in the days beforehand to pressure vice president pence to refuse to count lawful electoral votes,' she said in the video, saying it likely violated two federal criminal statutes. 'president trump had no factual basis for what he was doing, and he had been told it was illegal. despite this, president trump plotted with a lawyer named john eastman and others to overturn the election on january 6,' cheney alleges in the video preview. select committee aides told fox news wednesday afternoon: 'tomorrow's hearing is going to focus on former president trump's attempt to pressure the former vice president pence and unilaterally change the result of the election with a joint session of congress on january 6.' thursday's hearing comes after the first two public hearings held by the committee, which set the stage for the panel's main arguments. the committee postponed a previously scheduled hearing set for wednesday, citing 'technical issues.' during the jan. 6 committee's first public hearing, held last thursday during primetime, the lawmakers focused on trump's role in inciting the mob that attacked the capitol. the lawmakers set the stage for their hearings over the next several weeks by laying out how trump 'spurred a mob of domestic enemies' to attack the capitol in an effort to 'subvert american democracy' and overturn the 2020 presidential election. committee chairman bennie thompson, d-miss., in his opening statement, said trump 'was at the center of this conspiracy.' 'ultimately, donald trump, the president of the united states, spurred a mob of domestic enemies..to march down the capitol and subvert american democracy,' thompson said. the committee played never-before-seen footage of the events that transpired on jan. 6, 2021, with thompson, before playing the tape, warning that it 'is hard to watch.' there were two in-person witnesses in attendance during the first hearing: u.s. capitol police officer caroline edwards and filmmaker nick quested. the second public hearing featured testimony from trump 2020 campaign aides and lawyers who said the president ignored their advice on election day and proceeded to push election fraud conspiracies that had no factual basis. cheney declared during her opening statement that trump ignored the advice of his campaign team on election night to instead rely on an 'apparently inebriated' rudy giuliani, his former personal lawyer. former trump campaign spokesperson jason miller said giuliani 'was definitely intoxicated' when he advised the then-president to declare victory on election night, against the advice of his campaign team and while ballots were still being counted in multiple states. former attorney general bill barr testified in a recorded video deposition that he knew immediately following the election that trump’s claims of voter fraud were 'bulls---' saying trump’s continued promotion of a conspiracy theory ultimately led to his resignation. the second public hearing featured in-person witnesses chris stirewalt, former fox news political editor, election attorney benjamin ginsberg, former u.s. attorney for the northern district of georgia bjay pak and former city commissioner of philadelphia al schmidt. on wednesday, despite postponing its hearing for the day, the committee released a video of a tour conducted by rep. barry loudermilk, r-ga., on jan. 5, 2021 and renewed calls for information from the congressman related to the individuals in attendance. rep. zoe lofgren, d-calif., a member of the committee, said the video was revealed because 'we were getting a lot of questions.' 'one of the rioters was in the tour,' she told fox news wednesday. 'he was taking pictures of things that tourists ordinarily look at, like the tunnel between the rayburn building and the capitol, which is the tunnel that i was evacuated through that on [january] 6th, taking pictures of stairwells, he took pictures of the staff of the judiciary committee. and then, of course, the next day, he shows up [at] a riot threatening to kill nancy pelosi and chuck schumer and jerry nadler, and that we'd like to find out more about that.' loudermilk told fox news' chad pergram wednesday afternoon that he doesn't 'recognize' the man in the video who is making threats to house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., senate majority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., rep jerry nadler, d-n.y., and rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y. he also said he condemns those kinds of threats and described the language in the video as 'terrible.' rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez was also asked by fox news about the video. she replied: 'i find the juxtaposition between his statement that he released yesterday saying, i never gave a tour to anyone on january 5th. that, juxtaposed with the footage released by the committee today, shows a pretty stark contrast. and i think that it's when you see that footage, it's extremely understandable why the committee wants to speak with representative loudermilk. i'm not quite sure why he refuses to comply with an investigation into an attack that resulted in several people being dead here.'  the committee last asked loudermilk to testify on the issue in mid-may. wednesday's request remains only a request, however, and does not include a subpoena. loudermilk has called this a 'smear campaign' by the committee. biden's attorney general merrick garland said monday that both he and the jan. 6 department of justice prosecutors will be watching the hearings. 'at this point, this investigation is proceeding according to facts and the law,' he said. 'we are not obstructed from continuing our investigation in any way.' kelly laco is a politics editor for fox news digital.",2022-06-16,-0.9968,Very Negative,"['adam', 'kinzinger', 'describes',

'do you think these hearings are changing mainstream republicans, perhaps republicans like yourself about their attitudes regarding the former president?' cbs host vladimir duthiers asked. 'sure. it certainly changed my mind, yesterday’s testimony did,' mulvaney said. 'i’ve been defending the president against the charges of incitement to riot. i’ve seen the same speech he’s given dozens of times. i’ve seen him accused of trying to foment violence with no violence coming as a result, so i’ve been defending him. but after yesterday when she testified that he knew that there were guns on property and that he still encouraged people to go down to the capitol, that certainly changes my mind. whether or not it’s going to change the hard-core maga supporters on the right wing of the party, i don’t know. that remains to be seen.' asked if he'd vote for trump again, mulvaney, who was acting chief of staff and trump's budget director during his tenure, called that a good question that's come out of the hearings. he suggested that if more jan. 6 revelations do weaken trump politically, people could see a surge of interest in other republicans seeking the nomination, such as former vice president mike pence, florida gov. ron desantis, and former united nations ambassador nikki haley. 'but yes or no, sir, if he runs again, would you vote for him?' duthiers asked. 'oh, count me among one of the republicans who hopes he’s not the nominee at this point,' mulvaney said. mulvaney resigned as the trump administration's special envoy to northern ireland over the riot, along with several other officials who did so in protest. trump was impeached by the house in 2021 on a count of inciting an insurrection, but acquitted in the u.s. senate. hutchinson was a surprise witness at the jan. 6 committee this week, where she made a number of headline-making claims, including that trump was aware people at his rally on the national mall were armed, and he wanted to get rid of the 'mags,' or magnetometers, so more of his supporters could get in. she said trump didn't heed calls by his staff to call off his supporters as they stormed the capitol, and she said meadows sought a pardon before trump left office over potential concern of being implicated in criminality. she claimed trump had furious outbursts, including once throwing a dish at the wall in anger over his stolen election claims not being backed by the attorney general. she also said she heard secondhand that trump had lunged at the steering wheel of the vehicle he was in as an effort to be driven to the capitol the day of the riot, even having a physical altercation with a secret service member. multiple reports have indicated that the secret service will dispute the latter claims about trump's actions in the vehicle. hutchinson began her career as an intern for sen. ted cruz, r-texas, and rep. steve scalise, r-la., before ascending the ranks at the white house to become a trusted meadows aide.",2022-06-29,0.7124,Very Positive,"['former', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'aide', 'mick', 'mulvaney', 'longer', 'defend', 'former', 'president', 'riot', 'incitement', 'charges', 'hearing', 'cassidy', 'hutchinson', 'testimony', 'think', 'hearings', 'changing', 'mainstream', 'republicans', 'perhaps', 'republicans', 'like', 'attitudes', 'regarding', 'former', 'president', 'cbs', 'host', 'vladimir', 'duthiers', 'asked', 'certainly', 'changed', 'mind', 'yesterday', 'testimony', 'mulvaney', 'defending', 'president', 'charges', 'incitement', 'riot', 'seen', 'speech', 'given', 'dozens', 'times', 'seen', 'accused', 'trying', 'foment', 'violence', 'violence', 'coming', 'result', 'defending', 'yesterday', 'testified', 'knew', 'guns', 'property', 'still', 'encouraged', 'people', 'go', 'capitol', 'certainly', 'changes', 'mind', 'whether', 'change', 'maga', 'supporters', 'right', 'wing', 'party', 'remains', 'seen', 'asked', 'vote', 'trump', 'mulvaney', 'acting', 'chief', 'staff', 'trump', 'budget', 'director', 'tenure', 'called', 'good', 'question', 'come', 'hearings', 'suggested', 'revelations', 'weaken', 'trump', 'politically', 'people', 'see', 'surge', 'interest', 'republicans', 'seeking', 'nomination', 'former', 'vice', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'florida', 'gov', 'ron', 'desantis', 'former', 'united', 'nations', 'ambassador', 'nikki', 'haley', 'yes', 'sir', 'runs', 'vote', 'duthiers', 'asked', 'count', 'among', 'republicans', 'hopes', 'nominee', 'point', 'mulvaney', 'mulvaney', 'resigned', 'trump', 'administration', 'special', 'envoy', 'northern', 'ireland', 'riot', 'along', 'several', 'officials', 'protest', 'trump', 'impeached', 'house', 'count', 'inciting', 'insurrection', 'acquitted', 'senate', 'hutchinson', 'surprise', 'witness', 'committee', 'week', 'made', 'number', 'claims', 'including', 'trump', 'aware', 'people', 'rally', 'national', 'mall', 'armed', 'wanted', 'get', 'rid', 'magnetometers', 'supporters', 'get', 'trump', 'heed', 'calls', 'staff', 'call', 'supporters', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'meadows', 'sought', 'pardon', 'trump', 'left', 'office', 'potential', 'concern', 'implicated', 'criminality', 'claimed', 'trump', 'furious', 'outbursts', 'including', 'throwing', 'dish', 'wall', 'anger', 'stolen', 'election', 'claims', 'backed', 'attorney', 'general', 'heard', 'secondhand', 'trump', 'lunged', 'steering', 'wheel', 'vehicle', 'effort', 'driven', 'capitol', 'day', 'riot', 'even', 'physical', 'altercation', 'secret', 'service', 'member', 'multiple', 'reports', 'indicated', 'secret', 'service', 'dispute', 'latter', 'claims', 'trump', 'actions', 'vehicle', 'hutchinson', 'began', 'career', 'intern', 'ted', 'cruz', 'steve', 'scalise', 'ascending', 'ranks', 'white', 'house', 'become', 'trusted', 'meadows', 'aide']"

'it's not obvious -- this committee again promised that there would be new evidence being displayed today. there were a couple of videos that we had not seen before, but there was no direct new evidence of a criminal act by the former president,' turley said, adding trump's behavior may not have been criminal but was likely ill-advised and 'reprehensible.' instead of producing new, incontrovertible evidence, turley said, the panel rehashed a lot of what the past several hearings had covered, but this time attached a criminal referral to their presentation. 'the problem is, i don't think these convictions on this evidence would likely withstand judicial scrutiny. the biggest problem are those counts that turn on the president's speech,' turley said. 'that speech, in my view, was protected under existing supreme court cases like brandenburg [v. ohio]. it would not meet the standard the supreme court has set out for the criminalization of speech.' however, if trump were to be convicted based on the committee's case, the government may not have the same luck if he appeals. turley also looked at the future of the committee and its case against trump, as the house will flip to republican control in january – and the two republicans on the panel, liz cheney of wyoming and adam kinzinger of illinois, will no longer be in congress. 'you've got a bunch of folks that are repeating exactly what they have said now in repeated hearings. and each time they've said, we're going to be bringing in some new, powerful evidence and then they repeat it. you need more than that for a prosecution. you need more than mere repetition,' he said. some other members of the committee will also be out of congress by january: virginia democrat elaine luria was upset by rep.-elect jennifer kiggans, r-va., last month and rep. stephanie murphy of florida retired. thompson, reps. adam schiff, pete aguilar and zoe lofgren of california, along with maryland congressman jamie raskin all were re-elected. house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., has said if elected speaker, he will prevent schiff from remaining on another key panel, the house select committee on intelligence – where he is currently chairman. during the hearing, raskin said future generations will look back favorably on thompson and the committee's work. charles creitz is a reporter forfox news digital. he joined fox news in 2013 as a writer and production assistant. charles covers media, politics and breaking news, and has covered the annual cpac conference for fox news digital. charles is a pennsylvania native and graduated from temple university with a b.a. in broadcast journalism. story tips can be sent to charles.creitz@fox.com.",2022-12-19,-0.7391,Very Negative,"['news', 'contributors', 'jonathan', 'turley', 'andy', 'mccarthy', 'join', 'story', 'host', 'martha', 'maccallum', 'react', 'jan', 'committee', 'referring', 'donald', 'trump', 'criminal', 'prosecution', 'reports', 'thompson', 'committee', 'took', 'risk', 'putting', 'forward', 'referral', 'doj', 'respond', 'contradicting', 'claims', 'criminal', 'conduct', 'obvious', 'committee', 'promised', 'new', 'evidence', 'displayed', 'today', 'couple', 'videos', 'seen', 'direct', 'new', 'evidence', 'criminal', 'act', 'former', 'president', 'turley', 'adding', 'trump', 'behavior', 'may', 'criminal', 'likely', 'instead', 'producing', 'new', 'incontrovertible', 'evidence', 'turley', 'panel', 'rehashed', 'lot', 'past', 'several', 'hearings', 'covered', 'attached', 'criminal', 'referral', 'presentation', 'problem', 'think', 'convictions', 'evidence', 'likely', 'withstand', 'judicial', 'scrutiny', 'biggest', 'problem', 'counts', 'turn', 'president', 'speech', 'turley', 'speech', 'view', 'protected', 'existing', 'supreme', 'court', 'cases', 'like', 'brandenburg', 'ohio', 'meet', 'standard', 'supreme', 'court', 'set', 'criminalization', 'speech', 'however', 'trump', 'convicted', 'based', 'committee', 'case', 'government', 'may', 'luck', 'appeals', 'turley', 'looked', 'future', 'committee', 'case', 'trump', 'house', 'flip', 'republican', 'control', 'january', 'republicans', 'panel', 'liz', 'cheney', 'wyoming', 'adam', 'kinzinger', 'illinois', 'longer', 'congress', 'got', 'bunch', 'folks', 'repeating', 'exactly', 'repeated', 'hearings', 'bringing', 'new', 'powerful', 'evidence', 'repeat', 'need', 'prosecution', 'need', 'mere', 'repetition', 'members', 'committee', 'congress', 'january', 'virginia', 'democrat', 'elaine', 'luria', 'upset', 'jennifer', 'kiggans', 'last', 'month', 'stephanie', 'murphy', 'florida', 'retired', 'thompson', 'adam', 'schiff', 'pete', 'aguilar', 'zoe', 'lofgren', 'california', 'along', 'maryland', 'congressman', 'jamie', 'raskin', 'house', 'minority', 'leader', 'kevin', 'mccarthy', 'elected', 'speaker', 'prevent', 'schiff', 'remaining', 'another', 'key', 'panel', 'house', 'select', 'committee', 'intelligence', 'currently', 'chairman', 'hearing', 'raskin', 'future', 'generations', 'look', 'back', 'favorably', 'thompson', 'committee', 'work', 'charles', 'creitz', 'reporter', 'forfox', 'news', 'digital', 'joined', 'news', 'writer', 'production', 'assistant', 'charles', 'covers', 'media', 'politics', 'breaking', 'news', 'covered', 'annual', 'cpac', 'conference', 'news', 'digital', 'charles', 'pennsylvania', 'native', 'graduated', 'temple', 'university', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'story', 'tips', 'sent']"

'well, i don’t want to comment on that now,' trump said. still, trump did endorse mccarthy for reelection to congress, calling him a 'a tireless advocate for the people of bakersfield and the central valley.' ronn blitzer is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics and breaking news.",2022-06-22,0.825,Very Positive,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'think', 'retrospect', 'think', 'smart', 'put', 'republicans', 'committee', 'involved', 'standpoint', 'never', 'looked', 'closely', 'think', 'good', 'representation', 'trump', 'punchbowl', 'news', 'republicans', 'voice', 'even', 'anything', 'say', 'added', 'former', 'president', 'recognized', 'mccarthy', 'named', 'jordan', 'banks', 'pelosi', 'say', 'rather', 'respond', 'speaker', 'actions', 'turning', 'away', 'whole', 'process', 'trump', 'believes', 'mccarthy', 'pressed', 'forward', 'republicans', 'like', 'kevin', 'much', 'trump', 'maintained', 'retrospect', 'fair', 'many', 'people', 'committee', 'total', 'whatever', 'nobody', 'give', 'opposing', 'point', 'view', 'want', 'comment', 'trump', 'still', 'trump', 'endorse', 'mccarthy', 'reelection', 'congress', 'calling', 'tireless', 'advocate', 'people', 'bakersfield', 'central', 'valley', 'ronn', 'blitzer', 'reporter', 'news', 'digital', 'covering', 'politics', 'breaking', 'news']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-still-might-face-punishment-for-capitol-riot-even-after-senate-impeachment-acquittal,FOX,Trump still might face punishment for Capitol riot even after Senate impeachment acquittal,"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday, after the Senate acquitted him of the impeachment charge against him, teased a return to the political arena in his post-presidency -- but he may still face efforts to punish him for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by his supporters.","February 15, 2021 8:16am EST","university of baltimore law professor kimberly wehle and former deputy independent counsel sol wisenberg weigh in on 'america's news hq' 'our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to make america great again has only just begun,' trump said in a statement following the vote.'in the months ahead i have much to share with you, and i look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve american greatness for all of our people.' but in the coming weeks and months, trump could also be facing continued efforts to hold him accountable for allegedly inspiring a mob of his followers to storm the u.s. capitol during the jan. 6 joint session to certify the presidential election results. the rioters defaced the building and forced hundreds of lawmakers and former vice president mike pence into hiding as they chanted 'hang mike pence,' among other things. 'there's no question ... that president trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,' senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., said after the senate vote that acquitted trump. mcconnell voted that trump was not guilty. but he said his vote was not a reflection on trump's actions and instead was an expression of his opinion that the senate did not have the authority to hold an impeachment trial for a private citizen. mcconnell added that the attack 'was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth.' 'president trump is still liable for everything he did while in office,' mcconnell continued. 'he didn't get away with anything yet. we have a criminal justice system in this country. we have civil litigation.' indeed, there's an open criminal investigation in georgia into the call trump made to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, a republican, pressuring him to 'find' enough votes to flip the result of georgia's presidential election away from president biden. and some democrats are also pushing for a separate way to bar trump from office in the future now that impeachment failed. 'i do think that we need to spend months and months unearthing all the evidence that can possibly be gotten to through a 9/11-style commission,' sen. chris coons, d-del., said on abc's 'this week' on sunday.'and a number of republicans have already come out and said there should be further accountability, whether through a criminal trial or through some other path towards being barred from office.' coons appeared to be alluding to the 14th amendment, which some democrats say could be used to bar trump from running for office again. the amendment was passed in the wake of the civil war and aimed at preventing former u.s. officeholders who defected to the confederacy from holding office in the u.s. government again. it bars people 'who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of congress, or as an officer of the united states ...shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.' the amendment gives congress the power 'by appropriate legislation' to enforce this. some democrats, therefore, interpret this as a way to ban trump from office without clearing the 67-vote hurdle of an impeachment conviction. senate majorityleader chuck schumer, d-n.y., was asked about using the 14th amendment last week and declined to rule it out. trump attorney michael van der veen dismissed the possibility that trump could face any accountability in the future in an interview with cbs news, saying that mcconnell's comments specifically were just blustering. 'no, that's just political rhetoric. and i was hopeful that something would come out of this that the political rhetoric would stop out of washington d.c. but i guess apparently it hasn't,' he said. 'i'm not surprised to hear a politician say anything at all, no.' many republicans in the past few weeks have also floated the idea of passing a censure resolution against trump -- legislation that would simply express the sense of congress that what trump did was bad. house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., dismissed the idea in a press conference saturday however as giving republicans a chance to say they condemned the former president without actually taking a tough vote with consequences. 'censure is a slap in the face of the constitution. that gives, lets everybody off the hook. it lets everybody off the hook,' she said. 'all these cowardly senators who couldn't face up to what the president did and what was at stake for our country are now going to have a chance to give a little slap on the wrist? we censure people for using stationary for the wrong purpose. we don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the capitol.' meanwhile, members of both parties are supportive of a 9/11-style commission to investigate what led up to the jan. 6 attack. this commission would not necessarily have the power to punish the former president or anyone else. but it would, according to coons on 'this week,' 'lay bare the record of just how responsible and how abjectly violating of his constitutional oath president trump really was.' sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., on 'fox news sunday'said a commission would help clear up how there was so little security at the capitol on jan. 6 despite what apparently were repeated warnings that congress could be in danger. 'did nancy pelosi know january the fifth that there was a threat to the capitol? what did president trump do after the attack? we need a 9/11 commission to find out what happened to make sure it never happens again,' he said. 'and i want to make sure that the capitol footprint, can be better defended next time so i want to look at what pelosi knew when she knew that what president trump did after the attack and on the senate side was senate leadership informed of a threat.' he added: 'i'd like to know, did the capitol hill police inform the house sergeant at arms and the senate sergeant at armsthe day before the attack that they needed more troops so i want to look at all of it.' but graham also explicitly rejected the idea that trump could face further repercussions for his actions, which included months of false claims that he won the presidential election leading up to his jan. 6 speech, which he saidahead of time would be 'wild.' during that address, trump told supporters to march 'peacefully and patriotically' toward the capitol. defenders point to that comment as areason why trump was not responsible for the ransacking of the capitol. but those who supported his impeachment said that comment did not outweigh the balance of his rhetoric after the election, which graham himself said sunday was 'over the top.' graham, however, did not go as far as mcconnell in condemning trump wholesale and alluding to potential criminal charges for the former president. 'now i think sen.mcconnell's speech he got a load off his chest, obviously, but unfortunately he put a load on the back of republicans,' graham said of mcconnell's speech. 'i would imagine if you're a republican running in arizona or georgia or new hampshire where we have a chance to take back the senate, they may be playing sen. mcconnell's speech and asking you about it as a candidate. and i imagine if you're an incumbent republican, they're going to be people asking you 'will you support sen. mcconnell in the future?' graham added: 'i think his speech is an outlier regarding how republicans feel about all this.' tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington, d.c.",2021-02-15,-0.9929,Very Negative,"['university', 'baltimore',

Josh Hawley and Rep. Jim Jordan, responded to the latest installment of the ""Twitter Files"" which were released on Friday afternoon.","December 10, 2022 12:25am EST","fox news contributors joe concha and ari fleischer react to 'twitter files' part 3 and the company's efforts to censor conservatives on 'hannity.' the worries by conservatives that they were victims of blacklists, suspensions, and shadowbanning were all true, the files showed — contrary to testimony from the company’s executives. hawley added: 'it is hard to count the number of lies twitter executives told under oath to congress.' rep jim jordan, r-ohio, echoed: 'they told us twitter didn’t shadow ban. false.' 'what’s worse,' jordan asked his 3.4 million followers, 'former twitter executives lying about shadow banning [or] the media ignoring the story or promoting those lies?' at that time, 'big tech will be held accountable for their flagrant bias,' said rep. pat fallon, r-texas. earlier on friday, 'part one' of the third 'twitter files' installment was released via substack writer matt taibbi. the internal documents, dated from october 2020-january 2021, show 'the erosion of standards within the company in months before j6, decisions by high-ranking executives to violate their own policies, and more, against the backdrop of ongoing, documented interaction with federal agencies,' taibbi told his followers. 'whatever your opinion on the decision to remove trump that day, the internal communications at twitter between january 6th-january 8th have clear historical import. even twitter’s employees understood in the moment it was a landmark moment in the annals of speech,' he added. taibbi reported that executives at twitter 'started processing new power' following their decision to ban trump, indicating they were 'prepared to ban future presidents and white houses – perhaps even joe biden. the ‘new administration,’ says one exec, ‘will not be suspended by twitter unless absolutely necessary.’' the communications also showed twitter executives and staff operating in coordination with the fbi and other federal agencies. twitter ceo elon musk, though, defended the efforts of the fbi. 'with rare exception, the fbi seems to want to do the right thing, but there is no question that twitter operated as a democratic party activist machine,' musk tweeted. the release comes the day after musk shared 'part deux' of the 'twitter files' on thursday, showing how the company would 'build blacklists' of certain users or tweets. the internal documents were shared with journalist bari weiss. 'a new #twitterfiles investigation reveals that teams of twitter employees build blacklists, prevent disfavored tweets from trending, and actively limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics—all in secret, without informing users,' weiss said in a thread. weiss then recalled twitter heads previously denying that they performed such actions. 'in 2018, twitter's vijaya gadde (then head of legal policy and trust) and kayvon beykpour (head of product) said: ‘we do not shadow ban.’ they added: ‘and we certainly don’t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology,’' he reported. 'think about visibility filtering as being a way for us to suppress what people see to different levels. it’s a very powerful tool,' weiss reported, citing a 'senior twitter employee.' musk confirmed in a later tweet that 'some accounts on the right were suspended even when twitter internally acknowledged that no rules were broken.' the major reveal comes days after the initial installment of internal documents showed a glimpse at the company’s general content moderation protocols. according to the musk-provided and taibbi-shared information, twitter’s ever-persistent content moderation was a 'decision was made at the highest levels of the company, but without the knowledge of ceo jack dorsey, with former head of legal, policy and trust vijaya gadde playing a key role.' musk has promised transparency as he moves forward with leading the company.",2022-12-10,0.936,Very Positive,"['news', 'contributors', 'joe', 'concha', 'ari', 'fleischer', 'react', 'files', 'part', 'company', 'efforts', 'censor', 'conservatives', 'worries', 'conservatives', 'victims', 'blacklists', 'suspensions', 'shadowbanning', 'true', 'files', 'showed', 'contrary', 'testimony', 'company', 'executives', 'hawley', 'added', 'hard', 'count', 'number', 'lies', 'twitter', 'executives', 'oath', 'congress', 'rep', 'jim', 'jordan', 'echoed', 'us', 'twitter', 'shadow', 'ban', 'false', 'worse', 'jordan', 'asked', 'million', 'followers', 'twitter', 'executives', 'lying', 'shadow', 'banning', 'media', 'ignoring', 'story', 'promoting', 'lies', 'tech', 'held', 'accountable', 'flagrant', 'bias', 'pat', 'fallon', 'earlier', 'friday', 'third', 'files', 'installment', 'released', 'via', 'substack', 'writer', 'matt', 'taibbi', 'internal', 'documents', 'dated', 'october', 'show', 'erosion', 'standards', 'within', 'company', 'months', 'decisions', 'executives', 'violate', 'policies', 'backdrop', 'ongoing', 'documented', 'interaction', 'federal', 'agencies', 'taibbi', 'followers', 'opinion', 'decision', 'remove', 'trump', 'day', 'internal', 'communications', 'twitter', 'january', 'clear', 'historical', 'import', 'even', 'twitter', 'employees', 'understood', 'moment', 'landmark', 'moment', 'annals', 'speech', 'added', 'taibbi', 'reported', 'executives', 'twitter', 'processing', 'new', 'power', 'following', 'decision', 'ban', 'trump', 'indicating', 'ban', 'future', 'presidents', 'white', 'houses', 'perhaps', 'even', 'joe', 'biden', 'new', 'administration', 'says', 'exec', 'suspended', 'twitter', 'unless', 'absolutely', 'communications', 'showed', 'twitter', 'executives', 'staff', 'operating', 'coordination', 'fbi', 'federal', 'agencies', 'twitter', 'ceo', 'elon', 'musk', 'though', 'defended', 'efforts', 'fbi', 'rare', 'exception', 'fbi', 'seems', 'want', 'right', 'thing', 'question', 'twitter', 'operated', 'democratic', 'party', 'activist', 'machine', 'musk', 'tweeted', 'release', 'comes', 'day', 'musk', 'shared', 'deux', 'files', 'thursday', 'showing', 'company', 'blacklists', 'certain', 'users', 'tweets', 'internal', 'documents', 'shared', 'journalist', 'bari', 'weiss', 'new', 'twitterfiles', 'investigation', 'reveals', 'teams', 'twitter', 'employees', 'build', 'blacklists', 'prevent', 'disfavored', 'tweets', 'trending', 'actively', 'limit', 'visibility', 'entire', 'accounts', 'even', 'trending', 'secret', 'without', 'informing', 'users', 'weiss', 'thread', 'weiss', 'recalled', 'twitter', 'heads', 'previously', 'denying', 'performed', 'actions', 'twitter', 'vijaya', 'gadde', 'head', 'legal', 'policy', 'trust', 'kayvon', 'beykpour', 'head', 'product', 'shadow', 'added', 'certainly', 'shadow', 'ban', 'based', 'political', 'viewpoints', 'ideology', 'reported', 'visibility', 'filtering', 'way', 'us', 'suppress', 'people', 'see', 'different', 'levels', 'powerful', 'tool', 'weiss', 'reported', 'citing', 'twitter', 'employee', 'musk', 'confirmed', 'later', 'tweet', 'accounts', 'right', 'suspended', 'even', 'twitter', 'internally', 'acknowledged', 'rules', 'broken', 'major', 'reveal', 'comes', 'days', 'initial', 'installment', 'internal', 'documents', 'showed', 'glimpse', 'company', 'general', 'content', 'moderation', 'protocols', 'according', 'information', 'twitter', 'content', 'moderation', 'made', 'highest', 'levels', 'company', 'without', 'knowledge', 'ceo', 'jack', 'dorsey', 'former', 'head', 'legal', 'policy', 'trust', 'vijaya', 'gadde', 'playing', 'key', 'role', 'musk', 'promised', 'transparency', 'moves', 'forward', 'leading', 'company']"

Scott Perry and other members of Congress, as part of his ongoing investigation into former President Trump.","February 23, 2023 1:20pm EST","rep. scott perry, r-penn., shares his experience with the fbi after agents confiscated his cell phone and discusses the biden administration’s handling of national security issues including china, iran and the border. the panel heard arguments over whether the constitution shields the justice department from looking into 'informal' legislative efforts of u.s. lawmakers--including communications with private individuals and officials within the executive branch. the arguments come amid allegations that perry, r-pa., was in contact with then-president trump and then-chief of staff mark meadows in the days leading up to the capitol riot on jan. 6, 2021. judge gregory katsas, a trump appointee to the appeals court, spent a great deal of time quizzing government prosecutor john pelletieri about where the line is for protected communications concerning legislation. katsas seemed skeptical of the government’s ability to access large quantities of a congressman’s communications. 'your position is that no informal outreach is protected?' judge katsas asked, referring to the non-disclosure protection associated with the 'speech or debate clause' of the constitution. 'a member dealing with a vote on the floor has no fact-finding ability as to their vote?' judge katsas asked pelletieri. pelletieri argued before the panel that in order for a congressman’s communications to be protected they have to be 'connected to congress’ exercise of fact finding authority,' connected to legislation. judge neomi rao, also a trump appointee, described the government’s position as 'a tricky line.' 'why is an individual’s fact-finding not covered by the non-disclosure privilege, when a committee’s is?' asked rao. pelletieri argued that there 'has to be some kind of standard that requires fact-finding to be directly connected to something that is pending in congress.' the three-judge panel also questioned perry’s attorney, john rowley, on where the boundaries should be drawn, shielding lawmakers’ communications from scrutiny. rowley, arguing on behalf of perry, said that the communications the government is seeking from his client were directly related to two pending legislative matters before congress at the time, and therefore should not be available to the government. the fbi conducted an unprecedented raid on trump's mar-a-lago in august. smith is also tasked with overseeing the investigation into whether trump or other officials and entities interfered with the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election, including the certification of the electoral college vote on jan. 6, 2021. just a day after the fbi's raid on mar-a-lago, the fbi confiscated perry's cellphone. perry told fox news at the time that he was approached by three fbi agents who handed him a warrant and requested that he turn over his cellphone. the incident came while perry was traveling with his family. perry said his phone contained information about his 'legislative and political activities, and personal/private discussions with my wife, family, constituents, and friends.' 'none of this is the government’s business,' perry told fox news digital at the time. perry had been a target of interest of the democratic dominated january 6 house select committee last congress. perry was allegedly in communication numerous times with the trump white house in the days and weeks ahead of the storming of the capitol. meanwhile, garland also appointed a special counsel, robert hur, to investigate president biden's improper retention of classified records. jake gibson is the fox news department of justice and federal law enforcement producer",2023-02-23,0.9365,Very Positive,"['scott', 'perry', 'shares', 'experience', 'fbi', 'agents', 'confiscated', 'cell', 'phone', 'discusses', 'biden', 'administration', 'handling', 'national', 'security', 'issues', 'including', 'china', 'iran', 'border', 'panel', 'heard', 'arguments', 'whether', 'constitution', 'shields', 'justice', 'department', 'looking', 'legislative', 'efforts', 'lawmakers', 'including', 'communications', 'private', 'individuals', 'officials', 'within', 'executive', 'branch', 'arguments', 'come', 'amid', 'allegations', 'perry', 'contact', 'trump', 'staff', 'mark', 'meadows', 'days', 'leading', 'capitol', 'riot', 'judge', 'gregory', 'katsas', 'trump', 'appointee', 'appeals', 'court', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'quizzing', 'government', 'prosecutor', 'john', 'pelletieri', 'line', 'protected', 'communications', 'concerning', 'legislation', 'katsas', 'seemed', 'skeptical', 'government', 'ability', 'access', 'large', 'quantities', 'congressman', 'communications', 'position', 'informal', 'outreach', 'protected', 'judge', 'katsas', 'asked', 'referring', 'protection', 'associated', 'debate', 'clause', 'constitution', 'member', 'dealing', 'vote', 'floor', 'ability', 'vote', 'judge', 'katsas', 'asked', 'pelletieri', 'pelletieri', 'argued', 'panel', 'order', 'congressman', 'communications', 'protected', 'congress', 'exercise', 'fact', 'finding', 'authority', 'connected', 'legislation', 'judge', 'neomi', 'rao', 'trump', 'appointee', 'described', 'government', 'position', 'tricky', 'line', 'individual', 'covered', 'privilege', 'committee', 'asked', 'rao', 'pelletieri', 'argued', 'kind', 'standard', 'requires', 'directly', 'connected', 'something', 'pending', 'congress', 'panel', 'questioned', 'perry', 'attorney', 'john', 'rowley', 'boundaries', 'drawn', 'shielding', 'lawmakers', 'communications', 'scrutiny', 'rowley', 'arguing', 'behalf', 'perry', 'communications', 'government', 'seeking', 'client', 'directly', 'related', 'pending', 'legislative', 'matters', 'congress', 'therefore', 'available', 'government', 'fbi', 'conducted', 'unprecedented', 'raid', 'trump', 'august', 'smith', 'tasked', 'overseeing', 'investigation', 'whether', 'trump', 'officials', 'entities', 'interfered', 'peaceful', 'transfer', 'power', 'following', 'presidential', 'election', 'including', 'certification', 'electoral', 'college', 'vote', 'day', 'fbi', 'raid', 'fbi', 'confiscated', 'perry', 'cellphone', 'perry', 'news', 'approached', 'three', 'fbi', 'agents', 'handed', 'warrant', 'requested', 'turn', 'cellphone', 'incident', 'came', 'perry', 'traveling', 'family', 'perry', 'phone', 'contained', 'information', 'political', 'activities', 'discussions', 'wife', 'family', 'constituents', 'friends', 'government', 'business', 'perry', 'news', 'digital', 'perry', 'target', 'interest', 'democratic', 'dominated', 'january', 'house', 'select', 'committee', 'last', 'congress', 'perry', 'allegedly', 'communication', 'numerous', 'times', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'days', 'weeks', 'ahead', 'storming', 'capitol', 'meanwhile', 'garland', 'appointed', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'hur', 'investigate', 'president', 'biden', 'improper', 'retention', 'classified', 'records', 'jake', 'gibson', 'news', 'department', 'justice', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'producer']"

'a former president must be able to successfully invoke the presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his presidency, even if the current president does not support the privilege claim,' kavanaugh wrote.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/two-questions-jan-6-capitol-riot,FOX,Two questions from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot,There are two questions I still have a year after the riot at the U.S. Capitol.,"January 5, 2022 7:37pm EST","'tucker carlson tonight' host shows how the media uses history as a tool to distort the truth those are the two questions i still have a year after the riot at the u.s. capitol. i was on the air for more than 15 hours on january 6 and 7, 2021, holed up in the basement of the capitol, during the insurrection. i actually didn’t start my day on january 6 until about 1 pm – the time when the house and senate convened a joint session of congress to certify the electoral college. i began later than usual because we expected republican lawmakers to contest up to six states. the house and senate are allowed to debate each state’s slate of electors for two hours and then vote. so i thought the process may bleed well into january 7th if not january 8th. and therein lies the essence of my first question. how did the riot happen on january 6th of all days? the house and senate only convene a joint session of congress for two events: the president’s state of the union address and to certify the electoral college. the vice president and the speaker of the house preside over this session. the joint session in january 2013, to certify the re-election of president obama was a sleepy affair. no members challenged any state’s electoral votes. fewer than 80 members from either body came to the house chamber to watch 'tellers' (a group of house and senate members) inspect the electoral votes and to hear then-vice president biden announce the results. in fact, many freshman members – on the job for just a few days – only swung by so they could meet the vice president or pose for a photograph. january 6, 2021, emerged as one of the most toxic, intense days ever seen at the historic u.s. capitol. they never anticipated that a mob of americans would descend on the capitol and try to rip the place apart. especially on a day as central to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power. i’ve observed the fury and rage percolate for years now. americans of both sides – or unaffiliated – rage at washington. some of it justified. some of it not. some of it uninformed. some just hyperventilating. but to see a mob ransack the u.s. capitol in the middle of one of the most crucial moments in american democracy is the antithesis of the entire exercise. i never thought i would witness fellow citizens storm america’s citadel of democracy, break glass windows, assault police officers, defecate on the milton tile floors of the capitol and attempt to barge into the speaker’s lobby with intent to do god knows what. chilling doesn’t do the scenario justice. it’s one thing for a swarm of people to descend on capitol hill to protest. we’ve seen that before. it’s another thing to face a violent throng whipped into a fever like the one a year ago. there were challenges to electoral votes before. democrats attempted to question the certification of electoral votes for president george w. bush in both 2001 and 2005. the 2001 effort didn’t get very far. the 2005 maneuver actually prompted a brief debate in the house and senate over electors from ohio. the founders placed a ticking bomb inside the constitution when it comes to the electoral college. people don’t elect the president. electors who comprise the electoral college do. there’s a chasm for potential mischief between voters casting their ballots and the certification of a state’s electoral votes in congress. this is further enhanced by the founders mandating that the house would pick the president if the electoral college results weren’t clear. such 'contingent elections' presented the country with presidents thomas jefferson in 1801 and john quincy adams in 1825. but back to january 6th last year. what took so long to quash the uprising? practically every lawmaker, aide, reporter, and custodian always believed the capitol was a fortress. impenetrable. the building dodged disaster on 9/11. there are a lot of capitol police officers. but there were nowhere near as many officers as were needed to repel a pulse of people surging toward the capitol as there were on 1/6. former acting defense secretary christopher miller told a house panel last year that if troops went to the capitol, there were 'fears that the president would invoke the insurrection act to politicize the military in an anti-democratic manner.' in other words, miller worried that former president trump would convert those troops, trying to crush the mob, into a force which would declare him the winner. miller told the house committee there was 'heightened commentary in the media about the possibility of a military coup or that advisors to the president were advocating the declaration of martial law.' it doesn’t get much scarier than that. unless you try to understand why it took capitol police tactical units more than 45 minutes to finally end a siege in the house chamber with thugs pounding on the doors. it took hours. and hours. and hours. these are the questions: why did the riot happen on january 6 of all days? why did the riot go on for so long? there only are partial answers to these questions a year later. but some of the answers only beg deeper questions. chad pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for fox news channel (fnc). he joined the network in september 2007 and is based out of washington, d.c.",2022-01-05,-0.9878,Very Negative,"['carlson', 'tonight', 'host', 'shows', 'media', 'uses', 'history', 'tool', 'distort', 'truth', 'questions', 'still', 'year', 'riot', 'capitol', 'air', 'hours', 'january', 'holed', 'basement', 'capitol', 'insurrection', 'actually', 'start', 'day', 'january', 'pm', 'house', 'senate', 'convened', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'certify', 'electoral', 'college', 'began', 'later', 'usual', 'expected', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'contest', 'six', 'states', 'house', 'senate', 'allowed', 'debate', 'state', 'slate', 'electors', 'hours', 'vote', 'thought', 'process', 'may', 'bleed', 'well', 'january', 'january', 'therein', 'lies', 'essence', 'question', 'riot', 'happen', 'january', 'days', 'house', 'senate', 'convene', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'events', 'president', 'state', 'union', 'address', 'certify', 'electoral', 'college', 'vice', 'president', 'speaker', 'house', 'preside', 'session', 'joint', 'session', 'january', 'certify', 'president', 'obama', 'sleepy', 'affair', 'members', 'challenged', 'state', 'electoral', 'votes', 'fewer', 'members', 'either', 'body', 'came', 'house', 'chamber', 'watch', 'group', 'house', 'senate', 'members', 'inspect', 'electoral', 'votes', 'hear', 'president', 'biden', 'announce', 'results', 'fact', 'many', 'freshman', 'members', 'job', 'days', 'swung', 'meet', 'vice', 'president', 'pose', 'photograph', 'january', 'emerged', 'toxic', 'intense', 'days', 'ever', 'seen', 'historic', 'capitol', 'never', 'anticipated', 'mob', 'americans', 'descend', 'capitol', 'try', 'rip', 'place', 'apart', 'especially', 'day', 'central', 'democracy', 'peaceful', 'transfer', 'power', 'observed', 'fury', 'rage', 'percolate', 'years', 'americans', 'sides', 'unaffiliated', 'rage', 'washington', 'justified', 'uninformed', 'hyperventilating', 'see', 'mob', 'ransack', 'capitol', 'middle', 'crucial', 'moments', 'american', 'democracy', 'antithesis', 'entire', 'exercise', 'never', 'thought', 'witness', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'storm', 'america', 'citadel', 'democracy', 'break', 'glass', 'windows', 'assault', 'police', 'officers', 'defecate', 'milton', 'tile', 'floors', 'capitol', 'attempt', 'barge', 'speaker', 'lobby', 'intent', 'god', 'knows', 'chilling', 'scenario', 'justice', 'thing', 'swarm', 'people', 'descend', 'capitol', 'hill', 'protest', 'seen', 'another', 'thing', 'face', 'violent', 'throng', 'whipped', 'fever', 'like', 'year', 'ago', 'challenges', 'electoral', 'votes', 'democrats', 'attempted', 'question', 'certification', 'electoral', 'votes', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'effort', 'get', 'far', 'maneuver', 'actually', 'prompted', 'brief', 'debate', 'house', 'senate', 'electors', 'ohio', 'founders', 'placed', 'ticking', 'bomb', 'inside', 'constitution', 'comes', 'electoral', 'college', 'people', 'elect', 'president', 'electors', 'comprise', 'electoral', 'college', 'chasm', 'potential', 'mischief', 'voters', 'casting', 'ballots', 'certification', 'state', 'electoral', 'votes', 'congress', 'enhanced', 'founders', 'mandating', 'house', 'pick', 'president', 'electoral', 'college', 'results', 'clear', 'elections', 'presented', 'country', 'presidents', 'thomas', 'jefferson', 'john', 'quincy', 'adams', 'back', 'january', 'last', 'year', 'took', 'long', 'quash', 'uprising', 'practically', 'every', 'lawmaker', 'aide', 'reporter', 'custodian', 'always', 'believed', 'capitol', 'fortress', 'impenetrable', 'building', 'dodged', 'disaster', 'lot', 'capitol', 'police', 'officers', 'nowhere', 'near', 'many', 'officers', 'needed', 'repel', 'pulse', 'people', 'surging', 'toward', 'capitol', 'former', 'acting', 'defense', 'secretary', 'christopher', 'miller', 'house', 'panel', 'last', 'year', 'troops', 'went', 'capitol', 'president', 'invoke', 'insurrection', 'act', 'politicize', 'military', 'manner', 'words', 'miller', 'worried', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'convert', 'troops', 'trying', 'crush', 'mob', 'force', 'declare', 'winner', 'miller', 'house', 'committee', 'commentary', 'media', 'possibility', 'military', 'coup', 'advisors', 'president', 'advocating', 'declaration', 'martial', 'law', 'get', 'much', 'scarier', 'unless', 'try', 'understand', 'took', 'capitol', 'police', 'tactical', 'units', 'minutes', 'finally', 'end', 'siege', 'house', 'chamber', 'thugs', 'pounding', 'doors', 'took', 'hours', 'hours', 'hours', 'questions', 'riot', 'happen', 'january', 'days', 'riot', 'go', 'long', 'partial', 'answers', 'questions', 'year', 'later', 'answers', 'beg', 'deeper', 'questions', 'chad', 'pergram', 'currently', 'serves', 'senior', 'congressional', 'correspondent', 'news', 'channel', 'fnc', 'joined', 'network', 'september', 'based', 'washington']"

'the president's goal was to stay in power for a second term despite losing the election. the assembled crowd was one of the tools to achieve that goal.' toward the end of the hearing, the committee heard in-person testimony from capitol riot defendant stephen ayres and former oath keeper spokesperson jason van tatenhove.

'it doesn't necessarily include it includes violence. it includes trying to get their way through lies, through deceit, through intimidation, and through the perpetration of violence, the swaying of people who may not know better through lies and rhetoric and propaganda that can get swept up in these moments.' the committee obtained 'hundreds of messages' that raskin says show 'strategic and tactical planning' for the jan. 6 rally between various far-right groups that were coordinating with each other. 'these non-aligned groups were aligning,' former homeland security official donnell harvin testified. 'and so all the red flags went up at that point.' 'to have the federal government seize voting machines? that’s a terrible idea for the country. that’s not how we do things in the united states,' cipollone said. 'absolutely not,' barr claimed his response was at the time. 'there’s no probable cause, and we’re not going to seize any machines.' instead of denying involvement, cheney said, witnesses and those in trump’s orbit have increasingly tried to 'blame people his advisers called ’the crazies.' 'president donald trump is a 76-year-old man. he is not an impressionable child,' cheney said. 'and just like everyone else in our country, he is responsible for his own actions and his own choices.' in his closing statement, raskin said that trump's true legacy is 'american carnage.' 'in his inaugural address, trump introduced one commanding image, american carnage. although that turn of phrase explained little about our country before he took office, it turned out to be an excellent prophecy of what his rage would come to visit on our people,' raskin said. 'american carnage. that's donald trump's true legacy.' andrew mark miller is a writer at fox news. find him on twitter @andymarkmiller and email tips to andrewmark.miller@fox.com.",2022-07-12,-0.7199,Very Negative,"['news', 'host', 'mark', 'levin', 'goes', 'january', 'committee', 'attempting', 'question', 'legitimacy', 'presidential', 'election', 'liberty', 'levin', 'fair', 'say', 'agree', 'attorney', 'general', 'barr', 'conclusion', 'cipollone', 'referencing', 'barr', 'conclusion', 'categorically', 'describe', 'guys', 'tough', 'enough', 'former', 'trump', 'attorney', 'rudy', 'giuliani', 'heated', 'exchange', 'maybe', 'put', 'another', 'way', 'guys', 'bunch', 'p', 'former', 'trump', 'senior', 'adviser', 'eric', 'herschmann', 'testified', 'flynn', 'screamed', 'meeting', 'called', 'former', 'trump', 'counselor', 'derek', 'lyons', 'meeting', 'consisted', 'trump', 'attorney', 'sidney', 'powell', 'result', 'trump', 'staying', 'power', 'second', 'term', 'major', 'focus', 'hearing', 'trump', 'tweet', 'morning', 'meeting', 'protest', 'coming', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'wild', 'tweet', 'galvanized', 'trump', 'supporters', 'raskin', 'especially', 'dangerous', 'extremists', 'oath', 'keepers', 'proud', 'boys', 'racist', 'white', 'nationalist', 'groups', 'spoiling', 'fight', 'trump', 'followers', 'took', 'social', 'media', 'declare', 'ready', 'answer', 'trump', 'call', 'raskin', 'listing', 'social', 'media', 'posts', 'accounts', 'allegedly', 'belonging', 'trump', 'supporters', 'user', 'asked', 'sixth', 'trump', 'wants', 'everyone', 'raskin', 'us', 'come', 'armed', 'happening', 'f', 'happening', 'third', 'took', 'even', 'wild', 'means', 'need', 'volunteers', 'firing', 'squad', 'many', 'president', 'trump', 'loyal', 'supporters', 'clear', 'president', 'intended', 'assembled', 'crowd', 'serve', 'goal', 'already', 'seen', 'see', 'today', 'coming', 'specific', 'plans', 'murphy', 'president', 'goal', 'stay', 'power', 'second', 'term', 'despite', 'losing', 'election', 'assembled', 'crowd', 'tools', 'achieve', 'goal', 'toward', 'end', 'hearing', 'committee', 'heard', 'testimony', 'capitol', 'riot', 'defendant', 'stephen', 'ayres', 'former', 'oath', 'keeper', 'spokesperson', 'jason', 'van', 'tatenhove', 'think', 'saw', 'glimpse', 'vision', 'oath', 'keepers', 'necessarily', 'include', 'rule', 'law', 'van', 'tatenhove', 'testified', 'necessarily', 'include', 'includes', 'violence', 'includes', 'trying', 'get', 'way', 'lies', 'deceit', 'intimidation', 'perpetration', 'violence', 'swaying', 'people', 'may', 'better', 'lies', 'rhetoric', 'propaganda', 'get', 'swept', 'moments', 'committee', 'obtained', 'messages', 'raskin', 'says', 'show', 'tactical', 'planning', 'rally', 'various', 'groups', 'coordinating', 'groups', 'aligning', 'former', 'homeland', 'security', 'official', 'donnell', 'harvin', 'testified', 'red', 'flags', 'went', 'point', 'federal', 'government', 'seize', 'voting', 'machines', 'terrible', 'idea', 'country', 'things', 'united', 'states', 'cipollone', 'barr', 'claimed', 'response', 'probable', 'cause', 'seize', 'machines', 'instead', 'denying', 'involvement', 'cheney', 'witnesses', 'trump', 'orbit', 'increasingly', 'tried', 'people', 'advisers', 'called', 'crazies', 'donald', 'trump', 'man', 'impressionable', 'child', 'cheney', 'like', 'everyone', 'else', 'country', 'responsible', 'actions', 'choices', 'closing', 'statement', 'raskin', 'trump', 'true', 'legacy', 'carnage', 'inaugural', 'address', 'trump', 'introduced', 'commanding', 'image', 'american', 'carnage', 'although', 'turn', 'phrase', 'explained', 'little', 'country', 'took', 'office', 'turned', 'excellent', 'prophecy', 'rage', 'come', 'visit', 'people', 'raskin', 'carnage', 'donald', 'trump', 'true', 'legacy', 'andrew', 'mark', 'miller', 'writer', 'news', 'find', 'twitter', 'andymarkmiller', 'email', 'tips']"

'when bobby had relayed to him we're not, we don't have the assets to do it… the president had very strong, very angry response to that. tony described him as being irate,' hutchinson said. 'the president said something to the effect of, ‘i’m the f-ing president, take me up to the capitol now.' engel would not take trump to the capitol, however, according to hutchinson. 'the president reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel. mr. engel grabbed his arm, said, ‘sir, you need take your hand off the steering wheel. we’re going back to the west wing. we're not going to the capitol,' hutchinson continued. 'trump then used his free hand to lunge toward bobby engel. when mr. ornato had recounted this story to me he motioned towards his clavicles.' 'you told me this whole week you aren't coming up here. why would you lie to me?' hutchinson said mccarthy told her. 'i said, i'm not lying. i wasn't lying to you, sir,' hutchinson said. 'we're not going to the capitol.' mccarthy then said he saw trump say on the stage at his rally that he would be coming to the capitol, and again demanded that the white house stay away. hutchinson said she confirmed that the president would not be going to the capitol and later texted mccarthy to confirm that. hutchinson also said trump was upset about the lack of people in the crowd for his jan. 6 ellipse speech, and demanded that aides dispense with screening for attendees to help fill the crowd. hutchinson said that law enforcement confiscated a variety of weapons from people going through magnetometers to trump's rally, and that law enforcement saw many people outside the event with weapons. 'he thought the mags were at fault for not letting everybody in. but another leading reason, likely the primary reason, is because he wanted it full and he was angry that we weren't letting people through the mags with weapons -- what the secret service deems as weapons,' she said in recorded testimony tuesday. 'i was in the vicinity of a conversation where i overheard the president say something to the effect of, you know, 'i don't f-ing care that they have weapons,'' she also said via video. ''they're not here to hurt me. take the f-ing mags away. let my people in. they can march the capitol from here. let people in, take the f-ing mags away.'' 'i remember pat saying something to the effect of, 'mark, we need to do something more. they're literally calling for the vice president to be f-ing hung,'' hutchinson said. 'and mark had responded something to the effect of, 'you heard him pat, he thinks mike deserves it. he doesn't think they're doing anything wrong.' barr previously testified about his decision to make that comment and said it was key to ensuring transition of power to president biden. he made the comment in an interview with the associated press. hutchinson said trump threw his lunch against the wall upon reading the article. 'i remember hearing noise coming from down the hallway, so i poked my head out of the office. i saw the valet walking towards our office. he had said, get the chief down to the dining room,' hutchinson said. hutchinson said she followed, and once she arrived to the dining room, she saw that the valet was changing the tablecloth. she said she 'first noticed there is ketchup dripping down the wall and there's a shattered porcelain plate on the floor. the valet had articulated that the president was extremely angry at the attorney general's ap interview and had thrown his lunch against the wall, which was causing them to have to clean up. so i grabbed a towel and started wiping the ketchup up off of the wall to help the valet out.' tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington, d.c.",2022-06-28,-0.8569,Very Negative,"['anchor', 'report', 'chief', 'political', 'correspondent', 'joins', 'reports', 'close', 'tuesday', 'committee', 'hearings', 'discuss', 'takes', 'political', 'landscape', 'trump', 'denied', 'hutchinson', 'allegations', 'series', 'posts', 'truth', 'social', 'networking', 'app', 'former', 'president', 'total', 'phony', 'called', 'january', 'committee', 'kangaroo', 'court', 'five', 'top', 'moments', 'hutchinson', 'hearing', 'tuesday', 'hutchinson', 'recounted', 'conversation', 'former', 'white', 'house', 'deputy', 'chief', 'staff', 'tony', 'ornato', 'wake', 'trump', 'rally', 'ellipse', 'questioning', 'liz', 'cheney', 'according', 'hutchinson', 'ornato', 'trump', 'still', 'thought', 'left', 'stage', 'security', 'detail', 'capitol', 'supporters', 'already', 'broken', 'congress', 'counted', 'electoral', 'votes', 'bobby', 'relayed', 'assets', 'president', 'strong', 'angry', 'response', 'tony', 'described', 'irate', 'hutchinson', 'president', 'something', 'effect', 'president', 'capitol', 'engel', 'trump', 'capitol', 'however', 'according', 'hutchinson', 'president', 'reached', 'towards', 'front', 'vehicle', 'grab', 'steering', 'wheel', 'engel', 'grabbed', 'arm', 'sir', 'need', 'hand', 'steering', 'wheel', 'back', 'west', 'wing', 'capitol', 'hutchinson', 'continued', 'used', 'free', 'hand', 'lunge', 'toward', 'bobby', 'engel', 'ornato', 'recounted', 'story', 'motioned', 'towards', 'clavicles', 'whole', 'week', 'coming', 'lie', 'hutchinson', 'mccarthy', 'lying', 'lying', 'sir', 'hutchinson', 'capitol', 'mccarthy', 'saw', 'trump', 'say', 'stage', 'rally', 'coming', 'capitol', 'demanded', 'white', 'house', 'stay', 'away', 'hutchinson', 'confirmed', 'president', 'capitol', 'later', 'texted', 'mccarthy', 'confirm', 'hutchinson', 'trump', 'upset', 'lack', 'people', 'crowd', 'ellipse', 'speech', 'demanded', 'aides', 'dispense', 'screening', 'attendees', 'help', 'fill', 'crowd', 'hutchinson', 'law', 'enforcement', 'confiscated', 'variety', 'weapons', 'people', 'magnetometers', 'trump', 'rally', 'law', 'enforcement', 'saw', 'many', 'people', 'outside', 'event', 'weapons', 'thought', 'mags', 'fault', 'letting', 'everybody', 'another', 'leading', 'reason', 'likely', 'primary', 'reason', 'wanted', 'full', 'angry', 'letting', 'people', 'mags', 'weapons', 'secret', 'service', 'deems', 'weapons', 'recorded', 'testimony', 'tuesday', 'vicinity', 'conversation', 'overheard', 'president', 'say', 'something', 'effect', 'care', 'weapons', 'via', 'video', 'hurt', 'mags', 'away', 'people', 'march', 'capitol', 'people', 'mags', 'away', 'remember', 'pat', 'saying', 'something', 'effect', 'need', 'something', 'literally', 'calling', 'vice', 'president', 'hung', 'hutchinson', 'mark', 'responded', 'something', 'effect', 'heard', 'pat', 'thinks', 'mike', 'deserves', 'think', 'anything', 'wrong', 'barr', 'previously', 'testified', 'decision', 'make', 'comment', 'key', 'ensuring', 'transition', 'power', 'president', 'biden', 'made', 'comment', 'interview', 'associated', 'press', 'hutchinson', 'trump', 'threw', 'lunch', 'wall', 'upon', 'reading', 'article', 'remember', 'hearing', 'noise', 'coming', 'hallway', 'poked', 'head', 'office', 'saw', 'valet', 'walking', 'towards', 'office', 'get', 'chief', 'dining', 'room', 'hutchinson', 'hutchinson', 'followed', 'arrived', 'dining', 'room', 'saw', 'valet', 'changing', 'tablecloth', 'noticed', 'ketchup', 'dripping', 'wall', 'shattered', 'porcelain', 'plate', 'floor', 'valet', 'articulated', 'president', 'extremely', 'angry', 'attorney', 'general', 'ap', 'interview', 'thrown', 'lunch', 'wall', 'causing', 'clean', 'grabbed', 'towel', 'started', 'wiping', 'ketchup', 'wall', 'help', 'valet', 'tyler', 'olson', 'capitol', 'hill', 'producer', 'news', 'washington']"

'if we avoid confronting what happened here just a few short months ago, we can be sure that intimidation, coercion, and violence will become a defining feature of our politics for generations to come,' meijer said in a floor speech backing the commission. the house commission proposal was authored by homeland security committee chair bennie thompson, d-miss., and ranking member john katko, r-n.y. the bipartisan agreement met one major republican demand by including an equal number of members from each party, and it requires majority approval to issue subpoenas. but it did not meet another condition that mccarthy and some other republicans wanted: to investigate other political violence, such as antifa riots, in addition to the jan. 6 attack on the capitol. 'there has not been an investigation to stop the blm/antifa riots that have hurt innocent people,' said rep. marjorie taylor greene, r-ga., in calling out unrest in minneapolis, portland and other cities. greene said the commission will just be used as a political tool against republicans.

Capitol was sentenced Monday to seven years in prison, the longest sentence so far imposed.","August 1, 2022 6:27pm EDT","fox news state department correspondent rich edson covers potential criminal charges against former president trump in the wake of the january 6th committee and doj investigations on 'special report.' his prison sentence — seven years and three months — is two years more than the previous longest prison sentence for a capitol riot defendant. assistant u.s. attorney jeffrey nestler had requested 15 years for reffitt, calling him a domestic terrorist who wanted to physically remove and replace members of congress. u.s. district judge dabney friedrich rejected prosecutors' contention that an 'upward departure for terrorism' was warranted in reffitt's case. it was the first time that prosecutors have requested that sentencing enhancement for a jan. 6 case. friedrich, however, questioned why reffitt would merit the terrorism enhancement when many other rioters engaged in violence and made similarly disturbing threats. on monday, reffitt offered an expletive-laden apology to police officers, lawmakers and congressional staffers who were at the capitol on jan. 6. defense attorney clinton broden asked for reffitt to be sentenced to no more than two years in prison. broden noted that reffitt didn't assault any law enforcement officers or enter the capitol building. videos captured the confrontation between outnumbered capitol police officers and a mob of people, including reffitt, who approached them on the west side of the capitol. reffitt was armed with a smith & wesson pistol in a holster on his waist, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing body armor and a helmet equipped with a video camera when he advanced on the officers, prosecutors said. he retreated after an officer pepper sprayed him in the face, but he waved on other rioters who ultimately breached the building, prosecutors said. the jury found him guilty of obstructing congress' joint session, of interfering with police officers outside the capitol and of threatening his two teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement. reffitt's 19-year-old son, jackson, testified that his father told him and his sister, then 16, that they would be traitors if they reported him to authorities and warned them that 'traitors get shot.' reffitt lived with his wife and children in wylie, texas, a dallas suburb. he drove to washington, d.c., with rocky hardie, a fellow member of the texas three percenters militia group. hardie testified that both of them were armed with holstered handguns when they attended trump's 'stop the steal' rally before the riot. hardie also said reffitt gave him two pairs of zip-tie cuffs in case they needed to detain anybody. reffitt is one of seven capitol riot defendants to get a jury trial so far. jurors have unanimously convicted all seven of them on all counts in their respective indictments. more than 840 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. over 340 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. more than 220 have been sentenced, with nearly half of them receiving terms of imprisonment. approximately 150 others have trial dates stretching into 2023.",2022-08-01,-0.9956,Very Negative,"['news', 'state', 'department', 'correspondent', 'rich', 'edson', 'covers',

'none of the events of jan. 6th would have happened without him,' the report says. without in any way diminishing the importance of what happened on that dark day – or how the top election deniers lost in the midterms – this might be receding into history except for one thing. trump still constantly argues, to this day, that the election was stolen from him.",2022-12-20,-0.6801,Very Negative,"['news', 'congressional', 'correspondent', 'chad', 'pegram', 'latest', 'january', 'committee', 'investigation', 'reports', 'thing', 'marred', 'testimony', 'view', 'speeches', 'committee', 'members', 'led', 'chairman', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'vice', 'chair', 'liz', 'cheney', 'deliver', 'got', 'accounts', 'truth', 'new', 'piece', 'business', 'yesterday', 'criminal', 'referrals', 'even', 'done', 'throughout', 'existence', 'panel', 'leaked', 'advance', 'never', 'understood', 'committee', 'systematically', 'funnels', 'press', 'news', 'plans', 'break', 'media', 'filled', 'details', 'criminal', 'charges', 'panel', 'invoke', 'former', 'president', 'reason', 'tune', 'hear', 'speechifying', 'yes', 'historic', 'yes', 'referral', 'ever', 'made', 'former', 'president', 'purely', 'symbolic', 'probe', 'looking', 'storing', 'documents', 'pressure', 'state', 'officials', 'number', 'subpoenaed', 'special', 'counsel', 'referrals', 'really', 'matter', 'beyond', 'chance', 'panel', 'last', 'moment', 'television', 'sun', 'sometimes', 'subcommittee', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'investigation', 'refer', 'justice', 'allegations', 'news', 'department', 'hardly', 'case', 'committee', 'asked', 'doj', 'look', 'mark', 'meadows', 'trump', 'last', 'chief', 'staff', 'attorneys', 'rudy', 'giuliani', 'john', 'eastman', 'jeffrey', 'clark', 'kenneth', 'cheseboro', 'panel', 'posted', 'executive', 'summary', 'report', 'end', 'almost', 'entirely', 'focused', 'trump', 'cheney', 'wanted', 'report', 'emphasized', 'among', 'many', 'things', 'trump', 'watched', 'riot', 'television', 'hours', 'ignoring', 'deluge', 'pleas', 'sent', 'meadows', 'finally', 'asking', 'supporters', 'go', 'home', 'events', 'happened', 'without', 'report', 'says', 'without', 'way', 'diminishing', 'importance', 'happened', 'dark', 'day', 'top', 'election', 'deniers', 'lost', 'midterms', 'might', 'receding', 'history', 'except', 'thing', 'trump', 'still', 'constantly', 'argues', 'day', 'election', 'stolen']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-committee-jan-6-capitol-riot,FOX,Capitol riot: House creates committee to investigate Jan. 6 attack,"The House on Wednesday passed legislation to create a select committee focused solely on investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, a move that was panned by Republicans as too partisan but hailed by Democrats as necessary to give the American people a full accounting of what happened during the deadly attack. ","June 30, 2021 3:54pm EDT","'america's newsroom' co-host bill hemmer breaks down the details of the senate report the committee is charged with investigating the circumstances surrounding the 'domestic terrorist attack' and issuing a final report with recommendations for corrective measures. there's no timetable for the work to be completed, meaning the committee could keep the jan. 6 attack in the headlines well into the 2022 midterm election year. 'it will find the truth, which clearly the republicans fear,' pelosi said wednesday in a floor speech ahead of the vote. the select committee will be a 13-member body, and pelosi will appoint eight members, including a democrat chairperson. an aide says pelosi is 'seriously considering' including a gop member on her list of appointments. cheney and kinzinger would presumably be under consideration since they've been vocal critics of the attack and backed former president donald trump's impeachment for 'incitement of insurrection.' cheney said she voted in favor of forming the committee because it's the only option remaining to thoroughly investigate the 'unprecedented assault on congress.' already ousted from her gop house leadership position for routinely blaming trump for sparking the attack and spreading false information about the election being stolen, cheney wednesday lamented that 'the courage of my party’s leaders has faded' since jan. 6 'but the threat to our republic has not.' in all, about 140 police officers were injured during the jan. 6 attack.two police officers died by suicide in the days that followed, and a third, capitol police officer brian sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters. a medical examiner later found he died of natural causes. pelosi invited members of washington d.c.’s metropolitan police department (mpd) and the u.s. capitol police to attend wednesday’s vote, including officers harry dunn,michael fanone and daniel hodges.sicknick’s mother,gladys, and partner sandra garza, were also scheduled to be in the house balcony. rep. mo brooks, r-ala., who addressed the demonstrators along with trump on jan. 6 before the riot and led an effort in the house to challenge president biden's electoral college win, said he hoped mccarthy would not dignify pelosi's select committee with appointments. 'i think leader mccarthy and the gop should have their own select committee that does an investigation,' brooks told fox news. 'if the democrats are going to have a partisan investigation, so should the republicans.' the jan. 6 select committee will have subpoena power to conduct its investigation and to compel testimony. such committees have been dismissed in the past for serving political goals, notably the republicans’ house benghazi committee that took aim at former secretary of state hillary clinton during its investigation into the sept. 11, 2012, attack in libya. on jan. 6, people stormed inside the capitol to protest biden's electoral college certification in support of trump. they violently overtook police officers, destroyed capitol property, called for the killing of then-vice president mike pence and were on the hunt for pelosi. the mob briefly stopped the certification process in congress as lawmakers had to evacuate the house and senate chambers and take cover. one protester, ashli babbitt, was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the house chamber, and three others died of medical emergencies. roughly 500 people have since been arrested around the country and charged with federal crimes related to the jan. 6 attack.",2021-06-30,-0.998,Very Negative,"['newsroom', 'bill', 'hemmer', 'breaks', 'details', 'senate', 'report', 'committee', 'charged', 'investigating', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'issuing', 'final', 'report', 'recommendations', 'corrective', 'measures', 'timetable', 'work', 'completed', 'meaning', 'committee', 'keep', 'attack', 'headlines', 'well', 'midterm', 'election', 'year', 'find', 'truth', 'clearly', 'republicans', 'fear', 'pelosi', 'wednesday', 'floor', 'speech', 'ahead', 'vote', 'select', 'committee', 'body', 'pelosi', 'appoint', 'eight', 'members', 'including', 'democrat', 'chairperson', 'aide', 'says', 'pelosi', 'considering', 'including', 'gop', 'member', 'list', 'appointments', 'cheney', 'kinzinger', 'presumably', 'consideration', 'since', 'vocal', 'critics', 'attack', 'backed', 'former', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'impeachment', 'insurrection', 'cheney', 'voted', 'favor', 'forming', 'committee', 'option', 'remaining', 'thoroughly', 'investigate', 'assault', 'congress', 'already', 'ousted', 'gop', 'house', 'leadership', 'position', 'routinely', 'blaming', 'trump', 'sparking', 'attack', 'spreading', 'false', 'information', 'election', 'stolen', 'cheney', 'wednesday', 'lamented', 'courage', 'party', 'leaders', 'faded', 'since', 'threat', 'republic', 'police', 'officers', 'injured', 'police', 'officers', 'died', 'suicide', 'days', 'followed', 'third', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'brian', 'sicknick', 'collapsed', 'later', 'died', 'engaging', 'protesters', 'medical', 'examiner', 'later', 'found', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', 'pelosi', 'invited', 'members', 'washington', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'department', 'mpd', 'capitol', 'police', 'attend', 'wednesday', 'vote', 'including', 'officers', 'harry', 'dunn', 'michael', 'fanone', 'daniel', 'mother', 'gladys', 'partner', 'sandra', 'garza', 'scheduled', 'house', 'balcony', 'mo', 'brooks', 'addressed', 'demonstrators', 'along', 'trump', 'riot', 'led', 'effort', 'house', 'challenge', 'president', 'biden', 'electoral', 'college', 'win', 'hoped', 'mccarthy', 'dignify', 'pelosi', 'select', 'committee', 'appointments', 'think', 'leader', 'mccarthy', 'gop', 'select', 'committee', 'investigation', 'brooks', 'news', 'democrats', 'partisan', 'investigation', 'republicans', 'select', 'committee', 'subpoena', 'power', 'conduct', 'investigation', 'compel', 'testimony', 'committees', 'dismissed', 'past', 'serving', 'political', 'goals', 'notably', 'republicans', 'house', 'benghazi', 'committee', 'took', 'aim', 'former', 'secretary', 'state', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'investigation', 'attack', 'libya', 'people', 'stormed', 'inside', 'capitol', 'protest', 'biden', 'electoral', 'college', 'certification', 'support', 'trump', 'violently', 'overtook', 'police', 'officers', 'destroyed', 'capitol', 'property', 'called', 'killing', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'hunt', 'pelosi', 'mob', 'briefly', 'stopped', 'certification', 'process', 'congress', 'lawmakers', 'evacuate', 'house', 'senate', 'chambers', 'cover', 'protester', 'ashli', 'babbitt', 'shot', 'killed', 'day', 'trying', 'break', 'house', 'chamber', 'three', 'others', 'died', 'medical', 'emergencies', 'roughly', 'people', 'since', 'arrested', 'around', 'country', 'charged', 'federal', 'crimes', 'related', 'attack']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-impeaches-president-trump-second-time,FOX,"Trump impeached by House over Capitol riots, becomes first president to face rebuke twice",The House of Representatives Wednesday made history by voting to impeach President Trump for a second time in his presidency.,"January 13, 2021 4:36pm EST","house speaker nancy pelosi addresses the house as congress debates impeachment. trump has just one week left in office, but the supportersof the impeachment pushsay trump is too dangerous to stay in office a minute longer.the impeachment resolution condemns trump for spreading lies that he won the election in a landslide and whipping up a crowd of supporters in washington d.c. before the riot that killed five people, including a capitol police officer. 'the bottom line is this:this capitol was stormed. people died because of the big lies that were being told by this president, and by too many people on the other side of the aisle. enough,' said rep. jim mcgovern, d-mass., in a floor speech before the vote. 'peopleshould be outraged as to what happened. it was unforgivable, unconscionable. 'the president of the united states instigated an attempted coup in this country,' mcgovern continued. 'people died. ...if this is not an impeachable offense. i don't know what the hell is.this president is not fit to remain in office.' unlike the last house impeachment of trump in december 2019 for soliciting foreign interference in the presidentialelection, democrats had gop support. rep. liz cheney, the no. 3 house republican, backed impeachment because she said the violent attack at the capitol could not have happened without trump. 'the president of the united states summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,' said cheney, who is from wyoming.'everything that followed was his doing.' joining cheney in support of impeachment were gop reps. dan newhouse of washington, adam kinzinger of illinois, fred upton of michigan,jaime herrera beutler of washington, john katko of new york, anthony gonzalez of ohio, tom rice of south carolina, david valadao of california and peter meijer of michigan. 'president trump betrayed his oath of office by seeking to undermine our constitutional process, and he bears responsibility for inciting the insurrection we suffered last week,' meijer tweeted in advance of the vote. 'with a heavy heart, i will vote to impeach president donald j. trump.' most republicans, however, voted against the rushed impeachment because trump is already exiting office and the political action would do little to unite a fractured country. some die-hard trump supporters in the house also believe trump is not responsible for the violent actions of his supporters since the president specifically didn't call for violence. 'if we impeached every politician who gave a fiery speech to a crowd of partisans, this capitol would be deserted,' rep. tom mcclintock, r-calif. said. 'that's what the president did. that is all he did.' mcclintock accused democrats of makingprovocative speeches this summer in support of black lives matter protests that precipitated violence and looting in the name of racial injustice. he saiddemocratsshould be prepared for consequences the next time when the 'lunatic fringe' of their party acts out. 'i cannot think of a more petty, vindictive and gratuitous act thanto impeach analready defeated presidenta week before he is to leave office,' mcclintock said. the impeachment debate happened without any judiciary committee hearings. democratsrushed the resolution to the floor just one week after the mob attacked the capitol, destroyed property and stopped the work of both chambers of congress in certifying biden's win. shell-shocked members recalled the harrowing attack on the capitol where a woman was shot outside the house chamber, rioters beat police officers with fire extinguishers and the mobwent hunting for speaker nancy pelosi and vice president mike pence. the aftermath of the attack was prevalent as military troops were stationed throughout the capitol wednesday to protect the complex as the impeachment debate continued and a peaceful transfer of power hung in the balance. the house already called on pence to remove trump from office through the 25th amendment. pence, who presided over the jan. 6 joint session of congress,was targeted by raged trump supporters calling for his hanging after trump erroneously suggestedthe vice president had the power to stop biden from becoming president. cole said while trump bears some responsibility for the attack, impeachment is not the answer. 'jan. 6, 2021, will live in my memory as the darkest day during my time of service as a member of this house,' said cole, who has been in office for 18 years. 'but instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the house is choosing to divide us further.' the one article of impeachment is for'incitement of insurrection'and states that trump engaged inhigh crimes and misdemeanors by 'willfully inciting violence against the government of the united states.' trump refused to concede the election and encouraged his supporters to march to the capitol where he wanted congress to vote against the certification of biden's victory. 'if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore,' trump said. the resolutionalso calls out trump for his jan. 2 phone call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger where he urged the election officialto 'find' enough votes to overturn biden's win in the state -- and appeared to issue subtlethreats if raffensperger failed to do so. trump's actions warrantremoval from office and 'disqualification' to run ever again, the impeachment resolution states. evenhouse majority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., said wednesday he'd support censureover impeachment. 'the president bears responsibility for wednesday’s attack on congress by mob rioters,' mccarthy said. 'he should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.' but house democrats were too intent on impeachment and anger over the attack fueled the swift action on wednesday. 'he must go,' pelosi said. 'he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.' now, pelosi will send the article of impeachment over to the senate. once they arrive, the senate will convene atrial that will take place after trump leaves office. sen. chuck schumer, d.n.y., had been pressuring sen. mitch mcconnell, r-ky., to reconvene the senate immediately under 2004 emergency powers. but mcconnell's team informed schumer's office wednesday they would not consent. mcconnell confirmed the delay in a statement after the impeachment vote and said the trialwon't take place until after biden is inaugurated on jan. 20. 'i believe it will best serve our nation if congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming biden administration,' mcconnell said. it's unclear whether trump would be found guilty in the senate. it would require the vote of two-thirds of the body. the most damning consequence for trump would be being barred from running for president again in 2024, which could lessen his grip on the republican party and free up the gop field for new leaders. mcconnell supporteddemocrats'move to initiate impeachment proceedings against trump and is 'done' and 'furious' with him, sources familiar told fox news. but mcconnell wrote to his gop colleagues wednesday that he is undecided on whetherto convict trump.'while the press has been full of speculation, i have not made a final decision on how i will vote and i intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the senate.' the senate acquitted trump in february 2020 on both articles of impeachment last time, with sen. mitt romney being the only republican to break with his party. pelosi gathered with the impeachment managers after the vote to sign the official article of impeachment and pose for a photo at the engrossment ceremony. the action wednesday marks only the 21st time the house has ever impeached a government official. trump stands alone inhistory as becoming the only president to be impeached by the house twice. a double impeachment of a government official happened once before in 1798 whentennessee sen. william blount was impeached twice. though trump will no longer be president,the trial can still continue in the senate. it's happened before for someone who has left

https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-director-wray-capitol-riot-senate-hearing,FOX,"Capitol riot hearing: FBI Director Wray says no evidence Antifa, 'fake Trump supporters' involved","FBI Director Chris Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday that the bureau, to date, has not found any evidence showing Antifa members or ""fake Trump supporters"" participated in the Capitol riot.","March 2, 2021 12:36pm EST","in response to a question from sen. patrick leahy, d-vt., wray clarified that fbi's ongoing investigations have not found antifa involvement. 'we have not to date seen any evidence of anarchist violent extremists or people subscribing to antifa,' wray said. 'that doesn’t mean we’re not looking and we will continue to look.' sen. dick durbin, d-ill., asked wray to clarify rumors circulating online that 'fake trump supporters' might have infiltrated crowds that stormed the capitol on jan. 6 in an effort to disparage the former president. 'do you have any evidence that the capitol attack was organized by ‘fake trump protesters?'' durbin asked. to that, wray responded, 'we have not seen evidence of that at this stage.' wray also declined to disclose or confirm the cause of death for capitol police officer brian sicknick. addressing a widely reported 'norfolk memo' disseminated by the fbi on jan. 5, wray provided insight, claiming itwas quickly disseminated with law enforcementpartners within an hour in three different ways:firstin an email to the joint terrorism task force that includes members of both u.s. capitol police and metro police; second, verbally, it was walked through again at a command post meeting; and third, the information was posted on a law enforcement portal made available to law enforcement across the country.  'as to why the info didn't flow to all the people, i don't have an answer for that,' he said. wray testified that he did not personally see the report until after jan. 6, but the way the fbi reported it was done in the normal fashion. he said the memo included raw intelligence with unvetted and uncorroborated information found online but the threats were specific enough to cause concern. the justice department has so far charged more than 300 individuals in connection to the event, and wray will also likely face questions regarding the ongoing fbi investigations related to the riot, as well as how the bureau is confronting national security threats from domestic violent extremists.  the senators cited 'bipartisan' intelligence reports indicating that although attacks over the past few years involved domestic violent extremists 'across the political spectrum,' fbi and homeland security assessed that violent white supremacists represent the 'most significant domestic terrorism threat.'  'i think domestic terrorism, religious and racial-based hate groups have become a major threat in america,' durbin told reporters on capitol hill on monday. 'i want to know if our intelligence operations have taken this into consideration in establishing their priorities.' 'what did he know? when did he know it? and who did he tell?' durbin said. 'those are questions which have been raised in other hearings, but he is the man of the hour.' the fbi norfolk field office sent a memo to u.s. capitol police on jan. 5 suggesting that a coordinated attack was planned on jan. 6 and that congress was the target. the memo was first made public by the washington post on jan. 12, but former u.s. capitol police chief steven sund testified last week that he did not learn about it until weeks later --as recently as the day before he addressed congress. capitol police also produced its own intelligence memo indicating a similar coordinated attack on congress as early as jan. 3.  wray is also expected to be pressed on how the fbi is investigating future threats after u.s. capitol police acting chief yogananda pittman testified before the house appropriations subcommittee on the legislative branch last week that militia groups present on jan. 6 have states desires to 'blow up' the capitol in order to 'kill as many members as possible' when president biden addresses congress.  wray may also face questions about the fbi's investigation into the massive russian hack of corporations and u.s. government agencies, which happened when elite hackers injected malicious code into a software update. last week, sund, former senate sergeantof arms michael stenger, former house sergeant of arms paul irvingand metropolitan police chief robert contee testified before a joint senate rules and homeland security committee hearing. danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police and more. story tips can be

'above all, the work of the select committee underscores that our democratic institutions are only as strong as the commitment of those who are entrusted with their care.' in his own foreword, chairman thompson said those who broke into the capitol 'came dangerously close to succeeding' if it were not for the efforts of law enforcement personnel who 'put their lives on the line for hours.' 'every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one. january 6, 2021 was the first time one american president refused his constitutional duty to transfer power peacefully to the next,' she wrote. she also wrote that some senior officials in the trump administration, including vice president mike pence, did not condone or cooperate with efforts to remain in power.

'president trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision,' the introductory report reads. 'it was premeditated.' the committee is expected to release its final comprehensive report on wednesday. the document claims that even after legal challenges to overturn the 2020 election failed, trump pressured the justice department and state officials into decertifying the results. that push, according to the committee, culminated in demands that then-vice president mike pence reject electoral college votes from states won by president biden. 'even key individuals who worked closely with president trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on january 6th ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,' states the report. the summary includes the methods the committee took to come to more than 15 specific findings. the panel's introductory report serves as the basis for its decision to refer trump to the justice department for criminal prosecution. lawmakers say they have sufficient evidence that trump obstructed an official proceeding of congress, conspired to defraud the federal government, made a false statement, and incited, assisted or aided an insurrection. 'no man who would behave that way at that moment in time can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again,' said rep. liz cheney, a wyoming republican.

'in effect, it is theater because there it doesn't have any binding effect,' mccarthysaid in an interview with fox news digital. 'i think the justice department will ignore it.' 'the concern that the justice department has, or at least should have, is that they [the criminal referrals] can have the counterproductive effect of undermining whatever prosecution, if any, that the justice department decides to bring because they give former president trump the ability to make the claim, if he's charged, that the charges are the result of political pressure rather than evidence,' mccarthy added. 'even if they brought criminal charges that were based solely on evidence that they believed was reliable, they would still have to combat an argument in the trial that a heavily dominated democratic committee induced the democratic justice department to bring criminal charges in order to sideline the sitting democratic president’s likely rival in the 2024 election, which is not a position to want to be in as a prosecutor,' mccarthy said. fox news contributor jonathan turley, another former prosecutor and professor at georgetown university law school, said monday’s business meeting that was heavily choreographed 'missed the mark' in an effort to present a case that trump should be criminally charged. 'the failure of the committee to offer any new and direct evidence of criminal conduct was telling,' turley said. 'the fact is that the [january] 6 committee failed to change many minds largely because of what was on display in the final public meeting. it was the same highly scripted, one-sided account repeated mantra-like for months.' 'there is justifiable anger over these accounts, but this hearing was billed as presenting the case for criminal charges. it missed that mark by a considerable measure,' turley added. turley also criticized the mainstream media coverage of the committee’s activity, saying that coverage 'downplayed the flaring failure' of the committee to produce promised 'bombshell evidence of a criminal conspiracy by trump.' the committee's final report of its findings will be released on wednesday. brianna herlihy is a politics writer for fox news digital.",2022-12-19,-0.9903,Very Negative,"['story', 'welcomes', 'news', 'senior', 'congressional', 'correspondent', 'chad', 'pergram', 'breaks', 'latest', 'january', 'committee', 'final', 'meeting', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'effect', 'theater', 'binding', 'effect', 'mccarthysaid', 'interview', 'news', 'digital', 'think', 'justice', 'department', 'ignore', 'concern', 'justice', 'department', 'least', 'criminal', 'referrals', 'counterproductive', 'effect', 'undermining', 'whatever', 'prosecution', 'justice', 'department', 'decides', 'bring', 'give', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'ability', 'make', 'claim', 'charged', 'charges', 'result', 'political', 'pressure', 'rather', 'evidence', 'mccarthy', 'added', 'brought', 'criminal', 'charges', 'based', 'solely', 'evidence', 'believed', 'reliable', 'still', 'combat', 'argument', 'trial', 'heavily', 'dominated', 'democratic', 'committee', 'induced', 'democratic', 'justice', 'department', 'bring', 'criminal', 'charges', 'order', 'sideline', 'sitting', 'democratic', 'president', 'likely', 'rival', 'election', 'position', 'want', 'prosecutor', 'mccarthy', 'news', 'contributor', 'jonathan', 'turley', 'another', 'former', 'prosecutor', 'professor', 'georgetown', 'university', 'law', 'school', 'monday', 'business', 'meeting', 'heavily', 'choreographed', 'mark', 'effort', 'present', 'case', 'trump', 'criminally', 'charged', 'failure', 'committee', 'offer', 'new', 'direct', 'evidence', 'criminal', 'conduct', 'telling', 'turley', 'fact', 'january', 'committee', 'failed', 'change', 'many', 'minds', 'largely', 'display', 'final', 'public', 'meeting', 'highly', 'scripted', 'account', 'repeated', 'months', 'justifiable', 'anger', 'accounts', 'hearing', 'billed', 'presenting', 'case', 'criminal', 'charges', 'missed', 'mark', 'considerable', 'measure', 'turley', 'added', 'turley', 'criticized', 'mainstream', 'media', 'coverage', 'committee', 'activity', 'saying', 'coverage', 'flaring', 'failure', 'committee', 'produce', 'promised', 'evidence', 'criminal', 'conspiracy', 'trump', 'committee', 'final', 'report', 'findings', 'released', 'wednesday', 'brianna', 'herlihy', 'politics', 'writer', 'news', 'digital']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-panel-claims-trump-engaged-criminal-conspiracy,FOX,Jan. 6 panel claims Trump engaged in 'criminal conspiracy',The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol said Wednesday for the first time that its evidence suggests crimes may have been committed by former President Trump and his associates in the failed effort to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.,"March 3, 2022 7:56am EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. 'the select committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the president and members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the united states,' the committee wrote in a filing submitted in u.s. district court in the central district of california. the committee made the claims in response to a lawsuit by trump adviser john eastman, a lawyer and law professor who was consulting with trump as he attempted to overturn the election. eastman is trying to withhold documents from the committee. in a statement late wednesday, charles burnham, eastman’s attorney, said his client has a responsibility 'to protect client confidences, even at great personal risk and expense.' burnham added, 'the select committee has responded to dr. eastman’s efforts to discharge this responsibility by accusing him of criminal activity.' the brief filed wednesday was an effort to knock down eastman’s attorney-client privilege claims. in doing so, the committee argued there is a legal exception allowing the disclosure of communications regarding ongoing or future crimes. the committee said it has evidence that trump sought to obstruct an official proceeding — in this case, the certification of the election results — by trying to strong-arm pence to delay the proceedings so there would be additional time to 'manipulate' the results. 'the evidence supports an inference that president trump and members of his campaign knew he had not won enough legitimate state electoral votes to be declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election during the january 6 joint session of congress, but the president nevertheless sought to use the vice president to manipulate the results in his favor,' the filing states. in a jan. 6, 2021, email exchange between eastman and jacob revealed by the committee, eastman pushed for pence to intervene in his ceremonial role and halt the certification of the electoral votes, a step pence had no power to take. jacob replied: 'i respect your heart here. i share your concerns about what democrats will do once in power. i want election integrity fixed. but i have run down every legal trail placed before me to its conclusion, and i respectfully conclude that as a legal framework, it is a results-oriented position that you would never support if attempted by the opposition, and essentially entirely made up.' he added, 'and thanks to your bulls—-, we are now under siege.' so far, lawmakers and investigators have interviewed hundreds of people, including members of trump’s family and his chief of staff as well as his allies in the seven swing states where the former president tried and failed to prove he won. the panel has also sought out information from members of congress and subpoenaed records and testimony from top social media platforms they believe had a hand in the spreading of election misinformation. the committee is expected to fully release its findings in a lengthy report or series of reports later this year, ahead of the midterm elections. the panel is also planning days or weeks of hearings starting in april with some of the witnesses who testified. in other transcripts released as part of the filing, former senior justice department official richard donoghue described trying to convince trump that claims of election fraud were pure fiction. 'i told the president myself that several times, in several conversations, that these allegations about ballots being smuggled in a suitcase and run through the machines several times, it was not true, that we had looked at it, we looked at the video, we interviewed the witnesses, and it was not true.' at one point, donoghue said, he had to reassure trump that the justice department had investigated a report that someone has transported a tractor-trailer full of ballots from new york to pennsylvania. the department found no evidence to support the allegations, donoghue said. the transcripts also shed colorful detail on a contentious jan. 3, 2021, meeting at which trump contemplated replacing his acting attorney general, jeffrey rosen, with an assistant who promised to get to the bottom of the president’s bogus claims of election fraud. that assistant, jeffrey clark, had been the department’s top environmental enforcement lawyer for a period, a fact that led to some derision from colleagues at the meeting when it was pointed out that clark had not been a criminal prosecutor. 'and he kind of retorted by saying, ‘well, i’ve done a lot of very complicated appeals and civil litigation, environmental litigation, and things like that,’' donoghue said. 'and i said, ‘that’s right. you’re an environmental lawyer. how about you go back to your office, and we’ll call you when there’s an oil spill.’'",2022-03-03,-0.128,Neutral,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'select', 'committee', 'basis', 'concluding', 'president', 'members', 'campaign', 'engaged', 'criminal', 'conspiracy', 'defraud', 'united', 'states', 'committee', 'wrote', 'filing', 'submitted', 'district', 'court', 'central', 'district', 'california', 'committee', 'made', 'claims', 'response', 'lawsuit', 'trump', 'adviser', 'john', 'eastman', 'lawyer', 'law', 'professor', 'consulting', 'trump', 'attempted', 'overturn', 'election', 'eastman', 'trying', 'withhold', 'documents', 'committee', 'statement', 'late', 'wednesday', 'charles', 'burnham', 'eastman', 'attorney', 'client', 'responsibility', 'protect', 'client', 'confidences', 'even', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'expense', 'burnham', 'added', 'select', 'committee', 'responded', 'eastman', 'efforts', 'discharge', 'responsibility', 'accusing', 'criminal', 'activity', 'brief', 'filed', 'wednesday', 'effort', 'knock', 'eastman', 'privilege', 'claims', 'committee', 'argued', 'legal', 'exception', 'allowing', 'disclosure', 'communications', 'regarding', 'ongoing', 'future', 'crimes', 'committee', 'evidence', 'trump', 'sought', 'obstruct', 'official', 'proceeding', 'case', 'certification', 'election', 'results', 'trying', 'pence', 'delay', 'proceedings', 'additional', 'results', 'evidence', 'supports', 'inference', 'president', 'trump', 'members', 'campaign', 'knew', 'enough', 'legitimate', 'state', 'electoral', 'votes', 'declared', 'winner', 'presidential', 'election', 'january', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'president', 'nevertheless', 'sought', 'use', 'vice', 'president', 'manipulate', 'results', 'favor', 'filing', 'states', 'email', 'exchange', 'eastman', 'jacob', 'revealed', 'committee', 'eastman', 'pushed', 'pence', 'intervene', 'ceremonial', 'role', 'halt', 'certification', 'electoral', 'votes', 'step', 'pence', 'power', 'jacob', 'replied', 'respect', 'heart', 'share', 'concerns', 'democrats', 'power', 'want', 'election', 'integrity', 'fixed', 'run', 'every', 'legal', 'trail', 'placed', 'conclusion', 'respectfully', 'conclude', 'legal', 'framework', 'position', 'never', 'support', 'attempted', 'opposition', 'essentially', 'entirely', 'made', 'added', 'thanks', 'siege', 'far', 'lawmakers', 'investigators', 'interviewed', 'hundreds', 'people', 'including', 'members', 'trump', 'family', 'chief', 'staff', 'well', 'allies', 'seven', 'swing', 'states', 'former', 'president', 'tried', 'failed', 'prove', 'panel', 'sought', 'information', 'members', 'congress', 'subpoenaed', 'records', 'testimony', 'top', 'social', 'media', 'platforms', 'believe', 'hand', 'spreading', 'election', 'misinformation', 'committee', 'expected', 'fully', 'release', 'findings', 'lengthy', 'report', 'series', 'reports', 'later', 'year', 'ahead', 'midterm', 'elections', 'panel', 'planning', 'days', 'weeks', 'hearings', 'starting', 'april', 'witnesses', 'testified', 'transcripts', 'released', 'part', 'filing', 'former', 'senior', 'justice', 'department', 'official', 'richard', 'donoghue', 'described', 'trying', 'convince', 'trump', 'claims', 'election', 'fraud', 'pure', 'fiction', 'president', 'several', 'times', 'several', 'conversations', 'allegations', 'ballots', 'smuggled', 'suitcase', 'run', 'machines', 'several', 'times', 'true', 'looked', 'looked', 'video', 'interviewed', 'witnesses', 'true', 'point', 'donoghue', 'reassure', 'trump', 'justice', 'department', 'investigated', 'report', 'someone', 'transported', 'full', 'ballots', 'new', 'york', 'pennsylvania', 'department', 'found', 'evidence', 'support', 'allegations', 'donoghue', 'transcripts', 'shed', 'colorful', 'detail', 'contentious', 'meeting', 'trump', 'contemplated', 'replacing', 'acting', 'attorney', 'general', 'jeffrey', 'rosen', 'assistant', 'promised', 'get', 'bottom', 'president', 'bogus', 'claims', 'election', 'fraud', 'assistant', 'jeffrey', 'clark', 'department', 'top', 'environmental', 'enforcement', 'lawyer', 'period', 'fact', 'led', 'derision', 'colleagues', 'meeting', 'pointed', 'clark', 'criminal', 'prosecutor', 'kind', 'retorted', 'saying', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'complicated', 'appeals', 'civil', 'litigation', 'environmental', 'litigation', 'things', 'like', 'donoghue', 'right', 'environmental', 'lawyer', 'go', 'back', 'office', 'call', 'oil', 'spill']"

'january 6… was not ‘democracy in action,'' cheney said during floor debate. 'our oath of office is to support and defend the constitution, which provides the method by which we elect our president. legal challenges are not improper, but donald trump’s refusal to abide by the rulings of the courts certainly was.' cheney added that the jan. 6 committee has shown that trump knew what he was doing was illegal, 'but he did it anyway.' the bill also makes it much harder for lawmakers to object to the validity of electoral votes. currently, one member each from the house and senate is needed to lodge an objection, but the bill would require one-third of both chambers before an objection can be heard. democrats accused republicans who failed to back the bill of supporting violent extremism. 'our republican colleagues who are opposed to this legislation once again find themselves on the side of violent extremists,' said rep. pete aguilar, d-calif. he said passing the bill is a move to 'protect rule of law, strengthen the constitution and vote against insurrection.' 'given all the majority’s righteous and high-minded talk over the last two years about how democracy itself is in peril, don’t you think it would be better served to have operated through regular order with real member buy-in on a topic that is as important to the american people as this one?' rep. tom cole, r-okla., said this week. 'the midterm elections are just weeks away, and democrats in the 1/6 committee are desperately trying to talk about their favorite topic, and that is former president trump,' said rep. rodney davis, r-ill., who chairs the house administration committee. republicans did acknowledge that clarifying the vice president’s role as ministerial is a welcome idea, and several agreed that no vice president should have the power to pick the winner of the presidential election on the fly. but some republicans said the cheney-lofgren bill goes too far in prescribing election rules for states. the legislation requires governors to transmit their election results to the archivist of the united states by dec. 14 and allows candidates to file legal action against governors who fail to meet this requirement. it also requires states to determine their election results according to rules in place at the time of the election but allows states to extend elections in the event of a natural disaster that prevents a 'substantial portion' of voters from voting or destroys or makes ballots unreadable. davis said he opposed this language because it establishes federal guidelines for elections that should be run by the states. 'the constitution is clear,' davis said. 'states have the primary role in federal elections, with congress — us — playing a secondary role. yet some of the provisions in their proposal would trample on state sovereignty and grant congress unprecedented authority to interpret state laws.' some republicans added that allowing candidates to seek natural disaster exemptions to extend the election could lead to a more chaotic post-election period and predicted that candidates would seek any option available to prolong the process in close elections. others rejected the idea that the bill is bipartisan simply because it has the support of cheney and rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., the only two republicans to serve on the jan. 6 committee and two of 10 house lawmakers who voted to impeach trump over the jan. 6 protest at the capitol. pete kasperowicz is a politics editor at fox news digital.",2022-09-21,-0.8653,Very Negative,"['news', 'contributor', 'newt', 'gingrich', 'says', 'cheney', 'comments', 'seriously', 'lost', 'primary', 'bill', 'targets', 'trump', 'attempt', 'convince', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'challenge', 'electoral', 'vote', 'count', 'taking', 'place', 'democrats', 'perception', 'pence', 'power', 'overturn', 'electoral', 'count', 'contributed', 'capitol', 'hill', 'protest', 'bill', 'passed', 'house', 'wednesday', 'amends', 'electoral', 'count', 'act', 'clarify', 'vice', 'president', 'ministerial', 'role', 'interfere', 'process', 'make', 'judgments', 'validity', 'electoral', 'college', 'votes', 'cheney', 'language', 'aimed', 'preventing', 'repeat', 'trump', 'actions', 'democracy', 'action', 'cheney', 'floor', 'debate', 'oath', 'office', 'support', 'defend', 'constitution', 'provides', 'method', 'elect', 'president', 'legal', 'challenges', 'improper', 'donald', 'trump', 'refusal', 'abide', 'rulings', 'courts', 'certainly', 'cheney', 'added', 'committee', 'shown', 'trump', 'knew', 'illegal', 'anyway', 'bill', 'makes', 'much', 'harder', 'lawmakers', 'object', 'validity', 'electoral', 'votes', 'currently', 'member', 'house', 'senate', 'needed', 'lodge', 'objection', 'bill', 'require', 'chambers', 'objection', 'heard', 'democrats', 'accused', 'republicans', 'failed', 'back', 'bill', 'supporting', 'violent', 'extremism', 'republican', 'colleagues', 'opposed', 'legislation', 'find', 'side', 'violent', 'extremists', 'pete', 'aguilar', 'passing', 'bill', 'move', 'rule', 'law', 'strengthen', 'constitution', 'vote', 'insurrection', 'majority', 'righteous', 'talk', 'last', 'years', 'democracy', 'peril', 'think', 'better', 'served', 'operated', 'regular', 'order', 'real', 'member', 'topic', 'important', 'american', 'people', 'tom', 'cole', 'week', 'midterm', 'elections', 'weeks', 'away', 'democrats', 'committee', 'desperately', 'trying', 'talk', 'favorite', 'topic', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'rodney', 'davis', 'chairs', 'house', 'administration', 'committee', 'republicans', 'acknowledge', 'clarifying', 'vice', 'president', 'role', 'ministerial', 'welcome', 'idea', 'several', 'agreed', 'vice', 'president', 'power', 'pick', 'winner', 'presidential', 'election', 'fly', 'republicans', 'bill', 'goes', 'far', 'prescribing', 'election', 'rules', 'states', 'legislation', 'requires', 'governors', 'transmit', 'election', 'results', 'archivist', 'united', 'states', 'allows', 'candidates', 'file', 'legal', 'action', 'governors', 'fail', 'meet', 'requirement', 'requires', 'states', 'determine', 'election', 'results', 'according', 'rules', 'place', 'election', 'allows', 'states', 'extend', 'elections', 'event', 'natural', 'disaster', 'prevents', 'portion', 'voters', 'voting', 'destroys', 'makes', 'ballots', 'unreadable', 'davis', 'opposed', 'language', 'establishes', 'federal', 'guidelines', 'elections', 'run', 'states', 'constitution', 'clear', 'davis', 'primary', 'role', 'federal', 'elections', 'congress', 'us', 'playing', 'secondary', 'role', 'yet', 'provisions', 'proposal', 'trample', 'state', 'sovereignty', 'grant', 'congress', 'unprecedented', 'authority', 'interpret', 'state', 'laws', 'republicans', 'added', 'allowing', 'candidates', 'seek', 'natural', 'disaster', 'exemptions', 'extend', 'election', 'lead', 'chaotic', 'period', 'predicted', 'candidates', 'seek', 'option', 'available', 'prolong', 'process', 'close', 'elections', 'others', 'rejected', 'idea', 'bill', 'bipartisan', 'simply', 'support', 'cheney', 'adam', 'kinzinger', 'republicans', 'serve', 'committee', 'house', 'lawmakers', 'voted', 'impeach', 'trump', 'protest', 'capitol', 'pete', 'kasperowicz', 'politics', 'editor', 'news', 'digital']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mob-violence-halts-hill-election-debate-trump-accused-of-inciting-protesters,FOX,"Mob violence halts Capitol Hill election debate, Trump accused of inciting protesters","When President Trump addressed a big crowd of protesters outside the White House yesterday, he was caught between two historic defeats.","January 6, 2021 6:03pm EST","fox news senior correspondent mike tobin has the latest from the ground in washington. and then things really got bad. as congress began its debate, hundreds of flag-waving protesters breached barricades and some made their way into the capitol, forcing a lockdown and the evacuation of vice president mike pence and house speaker nancy pelosi as the house and senate debates were halted. tear gas was used in the capitol rotunda; lawmakers were given gas masks and told to shelter in place. things escalated from there, with an armed standoff outside the house floor. several officers were injured. it was a shocking spectacle, angry demonstrators trying to shut down the electoral process, and msnbc and cnn anchors repeatedly blamed trump for inciting the lawlessness. national review’s andy mccarthy said the same on fox. it was anarchy of the sort we would expect to see in certain third world countries. there was a pathetic photo of a protester sitting in the presiding officer’s chair on the senate floor. there was video of protesters smashing capitol windows and climbing in. one woman was shot in the chest on the capitol grounds. capitol police couldn’t handle the rioters, asking the d.c. police, who should have been defending the building from the start, for help. the city imposed a 6 p.m. curfew. it was an unbelievable miscalculation. and why the maddening delay in activating the national guard? after a long silence, trump finally tweeted: 'please support our capitol police and law enforcement...stay peaceful!' and later: 'i am asking for everyone at the u.s. capitol to remain peaceful. no violence!' for the president’s critics, it was the physical embodiment of trump refusing to accept the verdict of a lawful election. his most unhinged supporters, called to the capitol by trump, perhaps whipped up by his words, were literally stopping the constitutional process of certifying the next president. it was a white riot. one hundred years from now, this sad tableau will be remembered as an assault on democracy. the indelible images will define the end of the trump presidency. of course, it is not entirely the fault of trump or sen. ted cruz or sen. josh hawley or the more peaceful protesters that things spiraled out of control. but it is the president, who insists on election fraud that no court or his own justice department has confirmed, who will be remembered as fomenting the potentially dangerous insurrection. with trump staying off television, it was joe biden who seized the moment, condemning extremists for 'this godawful scene' and urging trump, whom he indirectly accused of incitement, to 'step up' and appeal for calm. moments later, trump posted a video in which he started off with the 'stolen' election, urged his supporters to 'go home' and added: 'we love you.' even before the capitol siege, the politics were running against trump. in his speech, the president said he hoped mike pence would 'do the right thing...and we become president and you are the happiest people.' but the vice president simply refused, telling the hill that the constitution gives him no 'unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.' perhaps the day’s most striking moment came when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a fierce partisan who has been such a trump loyalist, used language that any democrat would have been happy to embrace. the kentucky senator, citing all the losing lawsuits and 'sweeping conspiracy theories,' said that if congress overruled the voters, 'we could damage our republic forever...our democracy would enter a death spiral. we’d never see the whole nation accept an election again.' appearing pained, mcconnell said they were being asked to follow 'a poisonous path' and instead must choose 'a higher calling than an endless spiral of partisan vengeance.' sen. chuck schumer agreed, not surprisingly, calling it a 'very sad comment on our times that simply accepting an election is considered an act of political courage.' but mcconnell’s oratory was the powerful moment. for those trump supporters who believe the media are squelching evidence of election fraud, who think that dissenting republicans are betraying him, yesterday was the day when his own vice president and senate majority leader broke with him. in this overheated environment, the major issue in tuesday’s georgia runoffs for two senate seats was trump. in fact, his first words at a monday night rally in the state was that the state had been stolen from him. that raised the pressure on sen. kelly loeffler, who said on the eve of the election that she would vote with the ted cruz faction to challenge the electoral college results. the appointed republican senator was caught between trying to placate the president and his base and not looking like a sycophant. raphael warnock, a pastor who preached at martin luther king’s old ebeneezer baptist church, beat her to become georgia’s first black senator. democrat jon ossoff emerged with a 16,000-vote lead over incumbent sen. david perdue, with the expectation that his lead would grow when all the ballots were counted. if so, kamala harris would be able to break a 50-50 tie. but that is a battle for another day. jan. 6, 2021 was the day when washington lost control, when america lost control, and when donald trump lost control of the forces he unleashed.",2021-01-06,-0.9931,Very Negative,"['news', 'senior', 'correspondent', 'mike', 'tobin', 'latest', 'ground', 'washington', 'things', 'really', 'got', 'bad', 'congress',

'we are really here because the majority in the house of representatives does not want to face donald trump as a political rivalin the future,' bruce castor, a trump attorney, said.'that's the real reason we're here.' the democratic video mashup of trump's own words encouraging his supporters to 'fight like hell' was followed by graphic images of rioters thenbreaking down barricades at the capitol and yelling profanities at officers,such as'f**k d.c. police.' in the most uncomfortablemoments of the video, rioters were seen berating and beating capitol police officers as they were trying to stop the mob from entering the capitol. one officer is heard yelling out in pain as he's fighting off attackers. one officer died directly from his injuries, while another 140 officers were injured in the siege. the gripping 13-minute video included clips from sen. mitch mcconnell, r-ky., speaking on the senatefloor calling out trump's conspiracy theories on widespread election fraud on jan. 6 in contrast to the 'stop the steal' chants of rioters taking hold of the capitol. sen. james lankford, r-okla., was in the clip package for the moment when the senate had to be recessed as an aide tells him 'protesters are in the building.' the video showed trump's delayed reaction to the violence,where he continued to stoke grievances on election fraud and told riotersduring the attack to go home, though adding:'we love you. you're very special.' the graphic imagery seemed to have had an effect on the senators who will decidetrump's fate. the atmosphere in the chamber was incredibly tense while watching the video compilation of the assault on the capitol. almost every senator was watching the video, most wearing frowns, according to pool reports from insidethe chamber. senators in the room were being transported back to that day.the chamber was absolutely silent for about 10 seconds when the video ended.the sound of a pen dropping, a binder clicking and a senator coughing all seemed incredibly loud and jarring in that silence. raskin broke the silence with a simple conclusion. 'you ask what a high crime and misdemeanor is under our constitution. that's a high crime and misdemeanor,' raskin said. 'if that's not an impeachable offense, then there is no such thing.' rep. joe neguse, d-colo., followed up with arguments on why it's important and constitutionally correct to hold trump accountable for the jan. 6 riot even though he's no longer in office. he said there's no 'january exception' for impeachable conduct. neguse pointed tothe 1876corruption case of william belknap,president ulysses grant's war secretary, who was impeached and tried by the senate after leaving office. 'like every one of you, i was evacuated as this violent mob stormed the capitol's gates,' neguse said. 'what you experienced that day, what we experienced that day, what our country experienced that day is theframer's worst nightmare come to life. 'presidents can't inflame insurrection in their final weeks and then walk away like nothing happened.' trump's attorneys said thetrial is unconstitutional because he's now a private citizenand can't face removal.

Conservative congressman turned anti-Trump leader,The news on Sunday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will appoint Rep. Adam Kinzinger as the second Republican representative on the special House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is once again putting the Illinois congressman in the national spotlight.,"July 25, 2021 3:03pm EDT","rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., argues house minority leader kevin mccarthy lied to americans regarding details of the january 6 attack on the capitol but kinzinger, one of the most well-known republican critics of trump on capitol hill, has been making headlines for over a decade. kinzinger joined the air force after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, serving in both the wars in afghanistan and iraq. he’s currently a lieutenant colonel in the air national guard. as a 32 year old, he was first elected to congress in the tea party wave election of 2010, beating a democratic incumbent by nearly 15 points in a north central and north eastern illinois district, thanks in part to sarah palin’s endorsement. two years later, after redistricting, he took down 10-term gop rep. don manzullo in the primary before winning the general election. while he’s drawn praise from democrats for his anti-trump language, kinzinger doesn’t come close to aligning with the democrats on policy. he’s long opposed the affordable care act, best known as obamacare, opposes increasing taxes, and advocates against abortion rights. kinzinger was never a trump loyalist, but the attack on the capitol magnified his opposition to the then-president. the storming of the capitol occurred soon after trump urged a large crowd of supporters he addressed at a rally near the white house to march to the capitol and show strength in protesting the certification of theelection. the then-president was impeached by the house a week later on one count of inciting an insurrection. ten republicans – including kinzinger – joined all 222 democrats in voting to impeach trump, with 197 republicans voting against impeachment. in february, after leaving the white house, trump was acquitted in a senate trial, with 7 gop senators joining all 50 democrats in the chamber to vote to convict the former president. in an interview with fox news earlier this year, kinzinger lamented that 'today's republican party is not the one i joined.' 'the party that always spoke about a brighter tomorrow no longer does. it talks about a dark future instead. hope has given way to fear. outrage has replaced opportunity. and worst of all, our deep convictions are ignored. they've been replaced by poisonous conspiracies and lies. this is not the republican road and now we know exactly where new and dangerous road leads. it leads to insurrection and an armed attack on the capitol,' he argued. trump reshaped the republican party during his four years in the white house and ruled over it with an iron fist. and six months removed from his presidency, trump’s sway over the gop hasn’t diminished. kinzinger stressed that 'republicans must say enough is enough. it's time to unplug the outrage machine, reject the politics of personality and cast aside the conspiracy theories and rage.'

'first and foremost, the capitol was not secure that day. there was a systemic breakdown of security and leadership within capitol security; the top levels of the capitol police. when pelosi kicked me and jim jordan off that committee and said we weren't allowed to serve on it, we still went to work,' he said on 'the story.' other members of the jan. 6 committee include reps. elaine luria of virginia, jamie raskin of maryland, and adam b. schiff of california. pelosi said banks and jordan would endanger the 'integrity' of the committee, adding she would only accept the gop's other nominees: reps. kelly armstrong of north dakota, rodney davis of illinois and troy nehls of texas. house minority leader kevin mccarthy responded by pulling the entire slate, pledging not to participate in the 'sham process.' banks said he and jordan interviewed several capitol law enforcement and determined 'serious issues' around security and intelligence gathering & dissemination. an official from the union representing capitol police disclosed there was no intelligence-sharing that may have better prepared officers for the chaos, banks said. 'they had faulty or outdated equipment. some of them didn't even have riot shields or helmets on. the rioters had better equipment than they did,' he claimed. 'you haven't heard about these serious issues raised at all by this sham january 6 committee.' the true intent of the thompson-cheney committee is to legally prevent their joint political nemesis, donald trump, from being able to run for office again, banks said. other conservatives have pointed to the frequent use of the term 'insurrection' as a potential means for democrats to invoke the 14th amendment to stymie trump if they are able to link him to such a branding – as section iii therein bars those 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same' from federal or military office. banks said the areas of his investigation are not helpful to the jan. 6 committee's intended partisan ends. '[t]hat changes the narrative away from the political witch hunt going after donald trump and their narrative to try to abolish the electoral college, prevent donald trump's name from ever being on the ballot again [and] to intimidate donald trump's former staffers,' he said.

'his attire was consistent with his long-held shaman beliefs,' his attorney said. chansley turned himself in on saturday and faces charges of disorderly conduct, violent entry and illegally being on restricted spaces within the capitol grounds. but watkins said his client comported himself in a 'peaceful and compliant fashion' during the siege, which left five dead, including a police officer. 'he was unarmed. he was not violent. he was not destructive' — and deserves clemency from the outgoing commander-in-chief, the lawyer said. 'it would be appropriate and honorable for the president to pardon mr. chansley and other like-minded, peaceful individuals who accepted the president’s invitation with honorable intentions,' watkins said. meanwhile, chansley is being held in a federal lockup in phoenix, arizona while he awaits charges in washington, dc for his role in the insurrection. a judge recently ruled that chansleyshould be allowedto get organic food in line with his strict shaman diet behind bars after herefused to eat anything else.",2021-01-15,0.8963,Very Positive,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'chansley', 'seriously', 'countless', 'messages', 'president', 'trump', 'added', 'tens', 'millions', 'americans', 'chansley', 'felt', 'life', 'though', 'voice', 'heard', 'chansley', 'goes', 'names', 'jake', 'angeli', 'orqanon', 'shaman', 'went', 'viral', 'wild', 'outfit', 'riot', 'included', 'furry', 'horned', 'hat', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'face', 'paint', 'shirtless', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'brandished', 'spear', 'hung', 'american', 'flag', 'made', 'spectacle', 'dais', 'us', 'senate', 'attire', 'consistent', 'shaman', 'beliefs', 'attorney', 'chansley', 'turned', 'saturday', 'faces', 'charges', 'disorderly', 'conduct', 'violent', 'entry', 'illegally', 'restricted', 'spaces', 'within', 'capitol', 'grounds', 'watkins', 'client', 'comported', 'compliant', 'fashion', 'siege', 'left', 'five', 'dead', 'including', 'police', 'officer', 'unarmed', 'violent', 'destructive', 'deserves', 'clemency', 'outgoing', 'lawyer', 'appropriate', 'honorable', 'president', 'pardon', 'chansley', 'peaceful', 'individuals', 'accepted', 'president', 'invitation', 'honorable', 'intentions', 'watkins', 'meanwhile', 'chansley', 'held', 'federal', 'lockup', 'phoenix', 'arizona', 'awaits', 'charges', 'washington', 'dc', 'role', 'insurrection', 'judge', 'recently', 'ruled', 'chansleyshould', 'allowedto', 'get', 'organic', 'food', 'line', 'strict', 'shaman', 'diet', 'behind', 'bars', 'herefused', 'eat', 'anything', 'else']"

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-lies-january-6-enabled-unscrupulous-people-mockery-bill-of-rights,FOX,TUCKER CARLSON: Lies about January 6 have enabled unscrupulous people to make a mockery of our Bill of Rights,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson dismantles lies told about the Capitol breach of January 6 and raises questions about the committee's investigation on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""","January 6, 2023 10:33pm EST","fox news host tucker carlson reflects on the january 6 capitol breach two years later on 'tucker carlson tonight.' under normal circumstances, byrd would have been fired immediately and charged with murder, which he clearly committed, but that's not what happened. after doing essentially no investigation into the shooting, nancy pelosi's congressional police force declared byrd a national hero and the media strongly agreed.  byrd went on television to accept accolades and to complain about racism. he was never punished for killing ashli babbitt. he was rewarded for it. ashli babbitt 's mother, meanwhile, got a very different sort of treatment. babbitt's mother was arrested today in washington by the capitol police. her crime? trying to hold a memorial service for her daughter. on the basis of a wholly created myth about what happened that day, the biden pentagon conducted an unprecedented political purge of the entire u.s. military. the fbi and various intel agencies increased their control over the american media and most obviously, the doj has been allowed to prosecute and jail hundreds of nonviolent political protesters whose crime was having the wrong opinions. lies about january 6, which have been relentless, have enabled some of the most unscrupulous people in our country to make a mockery of our bill of rights and to steal our core freedoms. so they can't talk about ashli babbitt. talking about ashli babbitt makes it very clear who the real culprits are and who the real threats to this country continue to be and they're not the january 6 protesters. so instead, they lie about what happened that day and they do it in the boldest possible ways, without shame and with maximum aggression. here's hakeem jeffries, leader of the democrats in the house, telling you that five police officers were killed on january 6, when in fact, the real total is zero.  five heroic officers were lost, he said. it's almost impossible to believe that adults could stand behind him as he said that because everyone in the picture you just saw knows that is not true. it's not a stilted interpretation of events. it's a flat out lie. no police officers were killed on january 6. period. ashli babbitt was killed on january 6, but chances are our grandchildren will not know that because history will likely record the lie you just heard as true simply because it's been repeated so often. everyone in authority has said the same thing in unison for two solid years. as our thoroughly dishonest attorney general recently put it 'we will never forget the five officers who responded selflessly on january 6 and who have since lost their lives.' his boss, joe biden, repeated that lie today from the white house.  'that's historical fact,' says joe biden as he manufactures history, as he tells lies. they've been doing this, telling these same lies since the very first day, january 6, 2021, almost like it was a coordinated operation. remember when they told you that brian sicknick, officer brian sicknick, was beaten to death with a fire extinguisher?  that's not true and in the end, thanks to the medical examiner in the district of columbia, we learned the fact, which is that brian sicknick died of a stroke well after the january 6 protests. he was not beaten to death with a fire extinguisher, but that did not stop their lying or even slow them down. joe biden just awarded one of this country's highest civilian honors, the presidential citizen's medal, to officers working on january 6 and that would include the officers who opened the doors of the capitol building to the so-called insurrectionists, the officers who let them inside and then were rewarded for it by the president of the united states.  'what's going on here? ' you may wonder. well, don't ask. you're not allowed to know what's going on here, nor can you know about the very obvious clandestine role of federal agencies that encouraged the events of january 6. that happened, but its details have never been explained. a lot has still not been explained from that day, despite a committee that was impaneled for more than a year. for example, you remember the pipe bomber who planted explosives outside the democratic national committee? well, those explosives, it turns out, were under a bench at the same moment that kamala harris, who had secret service protection with her, who swept the building, was there. so, how did the u.s. secret service miss a bomb sitting in plain sight during its security sweep? well, we can't answer that because the fbi still to this day refuses to release all the security footage. why? what's going on here? almost unique among media outlets, revolver news asked that question.  so, somebody planted bombs outside the headquarters of this country's two main political parties. that would seem to be a big story, and yet no one ever mentions it again, including the fbi. in fact, the bureau won't disclose any information about the suspect, not his height, weight, shoe size, anything. so, if they wanted to catch this person, wouldn't they be telling you all they can about who it is? but they're not. why aren't they and what was kamala harris doing there? why did she lie about being there? we can’t answer those questions. we should be able to. nor does anyone in authority want to talk about ray epps. ray epps, is of course, is the man who was caught on tape encouraging the crowd outside the capitol, both on january 5 and 6, to commit felonies by rushing inside. now, what's interesting is that the january 6 committee, under public pressure, did in the end interview ray epps. now, we don't have all of the committee's records about that interview. we should, but we don't. but some have been released and what they tell is a remarkable story. in the testimony that we have, the committee coaches ray epps on how to answer questions about his involvement. 'i was in the front with a few others. i also orchestrated it. i helped get people there.' now, epps admitted that in a text message to a relative on january 6. he's admitting crimes. he's never been even charged for those crimes. but what's so fascinating is that when those facts came up in his interview with the committee, someone on the committee responds this way, and we're quoting: 'i just want to understand a little more your use of the word orchestrated. it sounds to me like at this point, when you sent this text, you had turned away in part because of seeing some things that you didn't agree with. is that right? like when you sent this, you were already on your way from the capital because of concerns of people taking it in a different direction. ' is that the most leading question ever asked in the history of a congressional hearing? probably. and the whole interview goes on like this. keep in mind, ray epps is one of the only people caught on camera that day encouraging others to break the law. he's one of the only ones and yet he's never been charged and the january 6 committee was on his side. did he talk about january 6before it happened with any employee of the u.s. government? we don't know. we do know that two years after january 6, long after an awful lot of other people have gone to jail for walking around the capitol building, ray epps is still a free man. he's never been charged, much less imprisoned in solitary confinement like so many others. why is that? well, let's just stop lying. at this point, it's pretty obvious why that is. but of course, they're still lying about it.",2023-01-06,-0.7821,Very Negative,"['news', 'host', 'tucker', 'carlson', 'reflects', 'january', 'capitol', 'breach', 'years', 'later',

'i've always said we need to do this. this isn’t the most bipartisan effort in it, but it is a review that is important,' hutchinson said. 'now the whole premise of the hearing is that president trump is criminally responsible, and that's the case they're trying to make. as bill barr has said, i think that is a heavy lift. i don't see the factual basis for that.' 'you can make the case, and i would agree, that he's politically, morally responsible for much of what has happened, but in terms of criminal liability, i think the committee has a long way to go before they could establish that,' he continued. 'i think the key thing politically is that the american public does not want us to focus on the past. it's an important review, but i think the democrats make a mistake if they simply want to re-litigate what they did in the impeachment.' hutchinson said trump made a 'costly error' for the republican party by his handling of the attack and that he hopes the party moves in a different direction than under the former president. 'i hope that the future of the republican party is different than [under] president trump's leadership,' he said. 'i hope we move in a different direction. i believe that what happened on january 6 is a lot at his feet.' 'obviously, what president trump, there's a lot of things that he did that were very good that the base and i agree with, but he got off track on january 6, and that was a costly error for our democracy,' he added. 'i think republicans need to do a lot of soul-searching as to what is the right thing here, what is the right thing to say for our party and our democracy and our future, and not simply appeal to the instincts of some of our base.'

'no one in this country, no matter how wealthy or how powerful, is above the law.' in their contempt report for bannon, the panel said his team had 'relied on no legal authority to support his refusal to comply in any fashion with the subpoena.' the report said bannon had 'specific knowledge about the events planned for january 6th before they occurred,' noting that he said on his jan. 5 podcast that 'all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.' thompson indicated the panel would pursue similar action if other witnesses do not cooperate with the investigation. the vote was seen as a critical moment for the select committee, whose members have vowed to compel trump administration officials to cooperate with their investigation. the decision could set up a lengthy court battle over the extent of protection offered by executive privilege. in late september, the select committee issued subpoenas for documents and testimony from four of trump’s former aides – bannon, former white house chief of staff mark meadows, former white house deputy chief of staff for communications daniel scavino, and former defense department official kashyap patel. the panel ordered bannon to appear at a deposition on oct. 14. trump’s attorneys instructed the aides not to comply with the subpoena. bannon declined to appear at the deposition. bannon’s attorneys cited trump’s instruction and argued the former president’s attempt to cite executive privilege should be resolved first. president biden declined to invoke executive privilege to prevent the release of trump-era documents sought by the select committee. his decision prompted trump to file a federal lawsuit against the jan. 6 select committee and the national archives this week, arguing the probe was a 'vexatious, illegal fishing expedition.' the committee rejected a request from bannon's attorney to delay a vote on the contempt report to allow consideration of trump's lawsuit. bannon served as a top adviser to trump during his 2016 presidential campaign and the early days of his administration. he left the white house in august 2017 and was not an active member of the administration during the period covered by the subpoena.",2021-10-19,-0.9817,Very Negative,"['trump', 'downplays', 'capitol', 'riot', 'bannon', 'stands', 'alone', 'complete', 'defiance', 'subpoena', 'acceptable', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'panel', 'chairman', 'remarks', 'prior', 'vote', 'country', 'matter', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'law', 'contempt', 'report', 'bannon', 'panel', 'team', 'legal', 'authority', 'support', 'refusal', 'comply', 'fashion', 'subpoena', 'report', 'bannon', 'knowledge', 'events', 'planned', 'january', 'occurred', 'noting', 'podcast', 'hell', 'break', 'loose', 'tomorrow', 'thompson', 'indicated', 'panel', 'pursue', 'similar', 'action', 'witnesses', 'cooperate', 'investigation', 'vote', 'seen', 'critical', 'moment', 'select', 'committee', 'whose', 'members', 'vowed', 'compel', 'trump', 'administration', 'officials', 'cooperate', 'investigation', 'decision', 'set', 'lengthy', 'court', 'battle', 'extent', 'protection', 'offered', 'executive', 'privilege', 'late', 'september', 'select', 'committee', 'issued', 'subpoenas', 'documents', 'testimony', 'four', 'trump', 'former', 'aides', 'bannon', 'former', 'white', 'house', 'chief', 'staff', 'mark', 'meadows', 'former', 'white', 'house', 'deputy', 'chief', 'staff', 'communications', 'daniel', 'scavino', 'former', 'defense', 'department', 'official', 'kashyap', 'patel', 'panel', 'ordered', 'bannon', 'appear', 'deposition', 'trump', 'attorneys', 'instructed', 'aides', 'comply', 'subpoena', 'bannon', 'declined', 'appear', 'deposition', 'bannon', 'attorneys', 'cited', 'trump', 'instruction', 'argued', 'former', 'president', 'attempt', 'cite', 'executive', 'privilege', 'resolved', 'president', 'biden', 'declined', 'invoke', 'executive', 'privilege', 'prevent', 'release', 'documents', 'sought', 'select', 'committee', 'decision', 'prompted', 'trump', 'file', 'federal', 'lawsuit', 'select', 'committee', 'national', 'archives', 'week', 'arguing', 'probe', 'illegal', 'fishing', 'expedition', 'committee', 'rejected', 'request', 'bannon', 'attorney', 'delay', 'vote', 'contempt', 'report', 'allow', 'consideration', 'trump', 'lawsuit', 'bannon', 'served', 'top', 'adviser', 'trump', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'early', 'days', 'administration', 'left', 'white', 'house', 'august', 'active', 'member', 'administration', 'period', 'covered', 'subpoena']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2024-watch-trump-pence-chasm-over-capitol-attack-widens-amid-fight-for-gop-future,FOX,2024 Watch: Trump-Pence chasm over Capitol attack widens amid fight for GOP future,"The divide widens between former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence over the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capital","February 6, 2022 8:58am EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. on friday, in his strongest language to date, pence rebuked his one-time boss, calling him out by name while discussing trump's claim that pence could have overturned the results of the 2020 presidential election. 'there are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of congress, i possessed unilateral authority to reject electoral college votes,' pence said near the end of a speech at a federalist society conference in florida in which he mostly took aim at the biden administration. 'i heard this week, president trump said i had the right to ‘overturn the election’. president trump is wrong … i had no right to overturn the election,' pence said to applause from the crowd of conservative lawyers. a week ago, trumpargued that a new bipartisan push in the senate to revise and further clarify the vice president’s ceremonial role in the quadrennial counting of electoral college votes by congress was proof that pence had the power to upend the results. 'what they are saying, is that mike pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away,' trump argued in his statement as he stepped up his repeated criticism of pence for certifying the election. 'unfortunately, he didn't exercise that power, he could have overturned the election!' by following his constitutional duties instead of following the then-president’s wishes and overturning the results of an election trump has repeatedly claimed - without providing concrete proof - was 'rigged' and 'stolen' from him, pence has endured the wrath of trump and his most devout loyalists and supporters. for a year, pence has repeatedly described the deadly attack on the capitol as 'tragic' and that he did 'the right thing' and performed his 'duty under the constitution.' while he remains proud of the accomplishments of the trump-pence administration and continues to strongly support the former president’s polices, he has acknowledged several times that he and trump may never'see eye to eye on that day.' during his friday speech, pence emphasized that 'frankly there is almost no idea more un-american than the notion that any one person could choose the american president.' 'under the constitution, i had no right to change the outcome of our election,' pence continued. 'and kamala harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024.' both trump and his former vice president could potentially face off if both decide to bid for the 2024 gop presidential nomination. trump has repeatedly flirted with making another white house run, and pence is making the early moves that could eventually lead to a bid of his own. one year removed from the white house, trump remains the most popular and powerful figure in the gop, as he continues to play a kingmaker’s role in party politics. pence allies waited for a sharp counter-attack from trump after the former vice president’s speech instantly made national headlines, but trump’s statement hours later did not include a blistering attack on his former vice president. 'just saw mike pence’s statement on the fact that he had no right to do anything with respect to the electoral vote count, other than being an automatic conveyor belt for the old crow mitch mcconnell to get biden elected president as quickly as possible,’ trump wrote. 'well, the vice president’s position is not an automatic conveyor if obvious signs of voter fraud or irregularities exist.' trump also argued 'that’s why the democrats and rinos are working feverishly together to change the very law that mike pence and his unwitting advisors used on january 6 to say he had no choice.' the resolution also states the rnc will 'no longer support them as members of the republican party.' the two vocal gop critics of trump were the highest profile of the 10 house republicans to vote last year to impeach the then-president for allegedly inciting the deadly riot at the capitol, and cheney and kinzinger are the only two republican members on the panel investigating the attack. rnc chair ronna mcdaniel charged in a statement after the vote to approve the resolution that 'liz cheney and adam kinzinger crossed a line. they chose to join [house speaker] nancy pelosi in a democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the capitol.' friday’s twin blockbuster developments spotlight the divide in the gop – as the party aims in this november’s midterm elections to regain majorities in the house and senate - between those who support trump’s push to look back to the 2020 election – and those like pence who insist that'the time has come to focus on the future.' overshadowed by the cheney/kinzinger resolution was the unanimous passage by an rnc panel of a report that makes no changes to the traditional top of the gop’s presidential nominating calendar. the party’s presidential nominating process committee is chaired by jeff kaufmann, the gop chair from iowa, the state whose caucuses have kicked off both parties' primary and caucus calendar for half a century. also sitting on the panel is the gop chair from new hampshire – which has held the first-in-the-nation presidential primary for a century and holds the second contest following iowa – and the chairs from south carolina and nevada, the other two early carve out states that vote third and fourth in the republican calendar. 'while we are one step closer to ensuring the carve out process is secured, i'm not taking anything for granted. if we want to ensure that anyone can be president, the carve out process and the iowa caucuses must be protected,' kaufmann told fox news. the move by the rnc to safeguard their calendar comes as some members of the rival democratic national committee are pushing to upend the longstanding tradition of iowa and new hampshire kicking off the nominating process, due in part to the lack of diversity in either state. the entire rnc will hold a vote on the panel’s report on the primary calendar when national party members convene for their summer meeting in early august. mcdaniel, on the eve of the winter meeting, told fox news that 'as of now i have not heard any recommendations to change the calendar. but i am not going to get ahead of our committee and our members on that front.' trump, in a statement on saturday evening, pledged that 'with me,iowa will always keep its first-in-the-nation status.' two republican sources with knowledge of the situation tells fox news that the rnc is likely in the coming couple of weeks to narrow from four to three the number of cities it’s considering to host its 2024 presidential nominating convention. the four cities remaining in the running are salt lake city, nashville, milwaukee, and pittsburgh. the sources confirm it’s likely that pittsburgh will be the first city jettisoned. the final decision on the host city will be announced at the summer meeting.",2022-02-06,0.9388,Very Positive,"['news', 'flash',

'people widely call it a protest that went too far, but how much further becomes more partisan. most americans — including most democrats, but just a fifth of republicans — call it an insurrection and describe it as an attempt to overturn the election and the government.' the graphic presented four options to the question as well as the results broken down by party affiliation. 85% of democrats viewed jan. 6 as 'an insurrection' or 'trying to overthrow' the government while only 21% and 18% of republicans agreed respectively. meanwhile, the graphic showed that 47% of republicans viewed jan. 6 as 'patriotism' and 56% viewed it as 'defending freedom,' something less than 13% of democrats agreed with. the margin of error was plus or minus 2.6 points. while cbs acknowledged in its report that americans 'widely call it a protest that went too far,' the liberal network significantly downplayed the bipartisan nature of that response. for starters, 'a protest that went too far' was the overwhelming favorite of the 2,046 americans who were polled with 76% agreeing with that characterization of jan. 6. the second most popular result was 'trying to overturn the election and keep donald trump in power' with 63%. both of those options were omitted in the graphic bolstered by cbs. meanwhile, 'an insurrection,' which came at a distant third with 55% of americans was kept in the graphic among the others which polled even less popular. among those who said jan. 6 was 'a protest that went too far,' a whopping 80% were republicans and 69% were democrats. those who described themselves as trump voters felt that way even more so with 84% while 70% of biden voters felt the same. notably, 80% of independents also described jan. 6 as a 'protest that went too far' while only 56% said it was 'an insurrection.' critics panned cbs news for how the jan. 6 poll was presented. others blasted the network for not even including 'riot' as an option for polled americans. cbs news did not immediately respond to fox news' request for comment. joseph a. wulfsohn is a media reporter for fox news digital. story tips can be sent to joseph.wulfsohn@fox.com and on twitter: @josephwulfsohn.",2022-01-06,0.8462,Very Positive,"['media', 'news', 'today', 'msnbc', 'reporter', 'warns', 'republicans', 'state', 'legislature', 'passing', 'voting', 'laws', 'make', 'every', 'day', 'medical', 'guest', 'says', 'companies', 'treat', 'unvaccinated', 'vaccinated', 'equal', 'white', 'house', 'reporter', 'asks', 'jen', 'psaki', 'biden', 'focused', 'scolding', 'happened', 'similar', 'year', 'ago', 'happened', 'cbs', 'news', 'wrote', 'article', 'sunday', 'widely', 'call', 'protest', 'went', 'far', 'much', 'becomes', 'partisan', 'americans', 'including', 'democrats', 'fifth', 'republicans', 'call', 'insurrection', 'describe', 'attempt', 'overturn', 'election', 'government', 'graphic', 'presented', 'four', 'options', 'question', 'well', 'results', 'broken', 'party', 'affiliation', 'democrats', 'viewed', 'insurrection', 'overthrow', 'government', 'republicans', 'agreed', 'respectively', 'meanwhile', 'graphic', 'showed', 'republicans', 'viewed', 'viewed', 'freedom', 'something', 'less', 'democrats', 'agreed', 'margin', 'error', 'plus', 'minus', 'points', 'cbs', 'acknowledged', 'report', 'americans', 'call', 'protest', 'went', 'far', 'liberal', 'network', 'significantly', 'downplayed', 'bipartisan', 'nature', 'response', 'starters', 'protest', 'went', 'far', 'overwhelming', 'favorite', 'americans', 'polled', 'agreeing', 'characterization', 'second', 'popular', 'result', 'overturn', 'election', 'keep', 'donald', 'trump', 'power', 'options', 'omitted', 'graphic', 'bolstered', 'cbs', 'meanwhile', 'insurrection', 'came', 'distant', 'third', 'americans', 'kept', 'graphic', 'among', 'others', 'polled', 'even', 'less', 'popular', 'among', 'protest', 'went', 'far', 'whopping', 'republicans', 'democrats', 'described', 'trump', 'voters', 'felt', 'way', 'even', 'biden', 'voters', 'felt', 'notably', 'independents', 'described', 'went', 'far', 'insurrection', 'critics', 'panned', 'cbs', 'news', 'poll', 'presented', 'others', 'blasted', 'network', 'even', 'including', 'option', 'polled', 'americans', 'cbs', 'news', 'immediately', 'respond', 'news', 'request', 'comment', 'joseph', 'wulfsohn', 'media', 'reporter', 'news', 'digital', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter', 'josephwulfsohn']"

'he was chosen in the only election that matters, the election held by the electoral college,' lee said. 'it was on that basis that i voted to certify the election results.' lee added that caveat that there is 'always room for debate and questions' about how well each state ran their election. 'for you to talk about the importance of the electoral college i think is rich,' mcmullin said. 'i think you knew how important it was when you sought to urge the white house that had lost an election to find fake electors to overturn the will of the people. sen. lee, that was the most egregious betrayal of our nation’s constitution in its history by a u.s. senator, and i believe that it will be your legacy,' mcmullin said, drawing scattered applause but mostly heavy boos from the audience. 'you advised spurious so-called legal efforts to mislead tens of millions of americans that the electionhad been stolen,' mcmullin said. 'and congratulations, you succeeded. as recently as this year, and even tonight, you’re still casting down on the legitimacy of the election.' 'you’re going a tremendous disservice to this country, sen. lee. you have betrayed your oath to the constitution with this,' he said. 'evan that’s not true,' lee fired back to applause. 'you know that’s not true. you, sir, owe me an apology.' lee said he was in communication with trump’s staff and others because there were rumors that some states would switch out their electors. 'the rumors were false. on that basis i voted to certify the results of the election,' lee said. lee has said in prior interviews that he only encouraged trump’s team to explore every legal remedy that might allow him to claim victory. press reports agreed that as it became clear trump could not win, lee cooled to the idea of fighting the result any further. mcmullin later called the jan. 6 riot a violent insurrection and said lee failed to do his duty to defend the constitution. 'it was a betrayal of the american republic.' 'i disagree with everything my opponent just said, including the words ‘but,’ ‘and’ and ‘the.’ it was an information-free, truth-free statement,' lee said. 'there is absolutely nothing to the idea that i would have ever supported or ever did support a fake elector plot. nothing. not a scintilla of evidence suggesting that, and yet you continue to insist that with a cavalier, reckless disregard for the truth.' lee then accused mcmullin of mimicking democratic talking points and spreading 'lies that are specific to the democratic party.' he said he acted in accordance with the constitution and said claims to the contrary go against that truth. 'how dare you, sir?' lee said as he held up a pocket constitution. 'sen. lee, the constitution is not a prop,' mcmullin tried again. 'this is not a prop and i don’t carry it as a prop,' lee said.

'has anyone been charged with the crime of insurrection following jan. 6?' lee asked the doj representatives, both of whom said they could not answer but were unaware of such charges being filed against anyone involved in the riot. lee attributed his intense series of questioning to the doj's allegedly sluggish and unhelpful response to the senator's previous inquiries outside the legislature. south carolina sen. lindsey graham asked olsen and sanborn a series of questions about the resources and finances available to the doj. 'do you need more money, and changes in the law to do your job?,' graham asked, to which olsen replied that he did not. graham continued, asking olsen if the u.s. withdrawal from afghanistan had invigorated terrorists in the region. 'from my vantage point, international terrorism remains a priority, and if i may broaden my answer a bit to say that we continue to be very concerned about isis forces in afghanistan,' olsen replied. 'we continue to have concerns about isis.'

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., went to Minnesota and told the protesters that they ""gotta stay on the street"" and ""get more confrontational."" ","April 18, 2021 10:40am EDT","fox news contributor ted williams and townhall.com senior writer julio rosas discuss the demonstrations on 'fox news @ night' waters’ most recent words could well be cited in the ongoing litigation over the jan.6riot on capitol hill. as i have previously discussed, the lawsuit by house members and the naacp may prove a colossal mistake. it is one of a number of lawsuits, including onefiled by rep. eric. swalwell, d-calif., that could ultimately vindicate trump shortly before the next election. while it is possible that members could find a trial judge to rule in their favor, these lawsuits should fail on appeal, if they get that far. moreover, they would fail under a lower standard of proof than the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard in criminal law. such a result would eviscerate the claim that trump was guilty of criminal incitement in his speech. after the riot, various legal experts proclaimed therewas a strong if not conclusive case for criminal incitement.cnn legal analystelie honig declared 'as a prosecutor i’d gladly show a jury trump’s own inflammatory statements and argue they cross the line to criminality.' richard ashby wilson, associate law school dean at the university of connecticut, said 'trump crossed the rubicon and incited a mob to attack the u.s. capitol as congress was in the process of tallying the electoral college vote results. he should be criminally indicted forinciting insurrectionagainst our democracy.' district of columbia attorney general karl racinethen thrilled many by declaring that he was investigating trump for a possible incitement charge. as i havepreviously written, these statements ignored both theelements of that crime and controlling case law. notably, while these and other experts insisted that the crime of incitement was obvious and public on jan. 6, there has been no charge brought against trump despite over four months. why? the reason is that an actual criminal case would lead to a rejection of not just the charge but the basis for the second trump impeachment.trump’s jan. 6 speech would not satisfy the test inbrandenburg v. ohio, where the supreme court stressed that even 'advocacy of the use of force or of law violation' is protected unless it is imminent. trump didnotcall for the use of force but actually told people to protest 'peacefully' and to 'cheer on' their allies in congress. after violence erupted, trump later told his supporters to respect and obey the capitol police. now waters, swalwelland others are rushing in where wiser democrats fear to tread. these civil lawsuits actually raise claims like the infliction of emotional distress that were directly and unequivocally rejected by the supreme court. in 2011,the court ruled 8-1 in favor of westboro baptist church, an infamous group of zealots who engaged in homophobic protests at the funerals of slain american troops. in rejecting a suit against the church on constitutional grounds, chief justice john roberts wrote: 'speech is powerful. it can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and –as it did here –inflict great pain. on the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.' yet, waters is not more deterred by the actual case law in this area than the legal experts on cnn and msnbc. indeed, waters has gone further and insisted that trump should not only be charged with criminal incitement but actual 'premeditated murder.' she stated,'for the president of the united states to sit and watch the invasion and the insurrection and not say a word because he knew he had absolutely initiated it – and as some of them said, ‘he invited us to come.'' that brings us back to brooklyn center this weekend. violence and looting have been unfolding around the country, including near the area where waters was speaking. yetshe called on people to stay in the streets and get more 'confrontational.' on the trial of former police officer derek chauvin, charged in the murder of george floyd last may, sheadded that there would be no acceptance of certain court decisions:'we're looking for a guilty verdict. if we don't, we cannot go away.' in my view, those words are political speech and should not be subject to criminal sanctions. however, i felt the same way about trump’s speech (which icondemned as he was giving iton jan. 6as reckless). i also rejected prior claims against waters like when she encouraged protesters to confront trump officials in restaurants and 'push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.' it is all protected speech. yet, that standard cannot be selectively applied to some but not all riots or protests. waters was encouraging protesters to continue to fight for what they believe in. her overheated rhetoric could easily be seen by some as an invitation or endorsement for rioting.however, criminalizing such speech would shred the guarantees of free speech in our country. carl jung once said,'everything that irritates us aboutotherscan lead us to an understanding of ourselves.'that certainly seems to be the case with waters and trump. it is also whywaters could prove the only witness that trump needs to call to defeat her own lawsuit against him.",2021-04-18,-0.9874,Very Negative,"['news', 'contributor', 'ted', 'williams', 'senior', 'writer', 'julio', 'rosas', 'discuss',

'to date, neither the laptop nor the gavel has been recovered,' they added. a witness described as a former romantic partner of williams told the fbi that she intended to send the stolen laptop or hard drive to a friend in russia who planned to sell it to russia’s foreign intelligence service. but the witness said williams kept the device or destroyed it when the transfer fell through, according to an fbi agent's affidavit. williams denied stealing the laptop when the fbi questioned her. she claimed her ex-boyfriend 'made up' the allegation, prosecutors said. before she left the capitol, williams joined other rioters in pushing against police officers trying to clear the building's rotunda. police body camera captured the confrontation, as williams encouraged other rioters to 'keep pushing,' and 'push, push, push.' williams was wearing a shirt bearing the message, 'i’m with groyper,' when she entered the capitol. the term 'groyper' refers to followers of 'america first' movement leader nick fuentes, who has used his online platform to spew antisemitic and white supremacist rhetoric. other followers of fuentes have been charged with jan. 6-related crimes, including former ucla student christian secor, 24, of costa mesa, california. secor, who was waving an 'america first' flag when he entered the capitol, was sentenced last month to three years and six months in prison. williams' online footprint also included material associated with 'accelerationism,' a violent ideology that asserts 'western governments are corrupt and unsalvageable, and therefore the best thing a person can do is accelerate their collapse by sowing social chaos and generating political conflict,' prosecutors said. in december 2020, williams attended at least two rallies protesting the outcome of the presidential election. both rallies featured speeches by fuentes. 'her admiration of nick fuentes, self-identification as a ‘groyper,’ belief in accelerationism, and support for violence all circumstantially show the mixed motives behind her actions on january 6: she not only specifically sought to block congress from certifying the electoral college vote, but also to undermine and obstruct the government more generally,' prosecutors wrote. before her trial, williams' attorneys questioned the relevance of her political activities and ideology. 'there is no evidence linking her beliefs and actions prior to january 6 with her actions that day,' they wrote.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/prosecutors-capitol-cop-jan-6-rioter,FOX,Prosecutors: Capitol cop told Jan. 6 rioter to hide evidence,A U.S. Capitol Police officer has been indicted on obstruction of justice charges after prosecutors say he helped to hide evidence of a rioter's involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection.,"October 15, 2021 2:11pm EDT","half of the chicago police department could face unpaid leave amid the coronavirus vaccine mandate; mike tobin reports on the latest.  he is due to appear in federal court in washington later friday. riley, who responded to a report of a pipe bomb on jan. 6 and has been a capitol police officer for about 25 years, had sent the person a message telling them that he was an officer with the police force who 'agrees with your political stance,' an indictment against him says. the indictment spells out how riley sent dozens of messages to the unidentified person, encouraging them to remove incriminating photos and videos and telling them how the fbi was investigating to identify rioters. it wasn't clear if he had an attorney who could comment on the charges against him. a call to the u.s. capitol police wasn't immediately returned. his arrest and the accusation that an active duty capitol police officer was trying to obstruct the investigation into the attack is particularly notable because many of his colleagues were brutally beaten in the insurrection. the riot left dozens of police officers bloodied and bruised as the crowd of pro-trump rioters, some armed with pipes, bats and bear spray, charged into the capitol, quickly overrunning the overwhelmed police force. one officer was beaten and shocked with a stun gun repeatedly until he had a heart attack; another was foaming at the mouth and screaming for help as rioters crushed him between two doors and bashed him in the head with his own weapon. more than 600 people face charges in the jan. 6 attack, in which a mob loyal to then-president donald trump stormed the capitol, battled police and tried to stop the certification of the election victory for president joe biden. experts say the efforts to scrub the social media accounts reveal a desperate willingness to manipulate evidence once these people realized they were in hot water. they say it can serve as powerful proof of people’s consciousness of guilt and can make it harder to negotiate plea deals and seek leniency at sentencing. riley told the rioter that the scene was a 'total s---show.' 'i’m glad you got out of there unscathed. we had over 50 officers hurt, some pretty bad,' the officer wrote, according to the complaint. when the rioter said through messaging that he didn’t think he’d done anything wrong, riley responded, according to court papers: 'the only thing i can see is if you went into the building and they have proof you will be charged. you could always articulate that you had nowhere to go, but that’s for court.' later in january, after two had discussed their love of fishing, riley told the man to get off social media. 'they’re arresting dozens of people a day,' he wrote, according to the posting. 'everyone that was in the building. engaged in violent acts or destruction of property and they’re all being charged federally with felonies.' making digital content vanish isn’t as easy as deleting content from phones, removing social media posts or shutting down accounts. investigators have been able to retrieve the digital content by requesting it from social media companies, even after accounts are shut down. posts made on facebook, instagram and other social media platforms are recoverable for a certain period of time, and authorities routinely ask those companies to preserve the records until they get court orders to view the posts. despite initial criticism that capitol police did not do enough to stop the rioters, riley is the first capitol police officer to be charged with a crime involving the insurrection. but several current and former police officers were arrested on riot-related charges, including two virginia police officers who posed for a photo during the attack. in july, authorities arrested an off-duty drug enforcement administration agent accused of posing for photographs in which he flashed his dea badge and firearm outside the capitol during the riot. other law enforcement officers were investigated for their presence at the capitol that day or at trump’s rally before the riot. in january, an associated press survey of law enforcement agencies nationwide found that at least 31 officers in 12 states are being scrutinized by their supervisors for their behavior in the district of columbia or face criminal charges for participating in the riot. it isn't clear whether riley was among the officers who were referred for disciplinary action.",2021-10-15,-0.9967,Very Negative,"['half', 'chicago', 'police', 'department', 'face',

'this is called an insurgency,' he said, explaining, 'this is called an insurgency. the insurrection that happened on january 6 that was one event. an insurgency is a chain of events. it’s common knowledge.' he then corrected people who told him 'that’s crazy, this isn’t an insurgency, this isn’t like iraq, it’s not like libya, it’s not like syria,' proclaiming, 'well, it is.' he then specifically claimed this trumpist insurgency is 'closer to the beginnings of the irish republican army.' 'it’s just a matter of seeing who comes up as the original irish republicans in this story and starts carrying out acts of violence to affect change,' he said. nance followed that up with his most shocking claim, that democracy-supporting americans 'may have to fight these' trumpists.

'we can see the president for two months after the election promoting that the election was stolen… he then scheduled the rally for january the 6, just when the transfer of power [was] to take place, and he brought together a crowd, but a portion of that was transformed into a mob and when they went into the capitol, it was clear that he wished that lawmakers be intimidated,' he said.

'however,instead of using their final days in power to make life for americans any better, democrats are doubling and tripling down on their partisan theatrics.' budowich added, 'pres trump will not be intimidate[d] by their meritless rhetoric or un-american actions.trump-endorsed candidates will sweep the midterms, and america first leadership & solutions will be restored. make america great again!' trump could fight the subpoena, which likely would tip off a legal fight with just over two months left in the current congress — a very short time frame for such a major legal dispute. if republicans take over the house in the midterms, it's not expected they will continue the work of the jan. 6 committee. trump’s one-time campaign manager, brad parscale, reportedly told the committee that the former president planned as early as july 2020 to declare re-election victory in november. rep. zoe lofgren, d-calif., claimed that parscale had told the committee that trump long planned a pre-emptive declaration of victory. 'in the course of our investigation, we also interviewed brad parscale, president trump's former campaign manager. he told us he understood that president trump planned as early as july that he would say he won the election even if he lost,' said lofgren. members of the committee also played videos of trump allies, including steve bannon and roger stone, arguing for a pre-emptive declaration of victory. in the wake of the 2020 election, trump signed a memo ordering u.s. troops to withdraw from afghanistan and somalia, according to witnesses who testified before the jan. 6 committee. rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., said the order proved that trump understood that he had lost the white house and was moving to wind down the u.s. troop presence abroad before president biden took office. 'knowing that he had lost and that he had only weeks left in office, president trump rushed to complete his unfinished business,' said kinzinger. 'knowing he was leaving office, he acted immediately and signed this order on nov. 11th, which would have required the immediate withdrawal of troops from somalia and afghanistan — all to be complete before the biden inauguration on jan. 20th.' military witnesses said they believed that trump's plan was highly reckless and would have been a debacle — just as president biden's afghanistan withdrawal turned out to be in august 2021. the committee did not detail why the order was never carried out. the committee played video of democratic and republican congressional leaders urging trump and top administration officials to act immediately to quell the riot during the height of the attack. party leaders, including house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and senate minority whip john thune, r-s.d., were also shown gathering around a phone asking federal and state officials for military help. rep. pete aguilar, d-calif., a member of the committee, said there were plans to recall witnesses who testified that trump allegedly lunged at a secret service agent for refusing to drive him to the capitol during the attack. 'after concluding its review of the voluminous additional secret service communications from jan. 5th and jan. 6th, the committee will be recalling witnesses and conducting further investigative depositions based on that material,' said aguilar. earlier this year, former white house aide cassidy hutchinson recounted a conversation she had with ex-trump deputy chief of staff tony ornato directly after trump's rally in front of the ellipse on jan. 6. hutchinson said ornato told her that trump tried to 'grab at the steering wheel' then lunged at the secret service agent in charge at the time because the agent wouldn't drive trump to the capitol as the riot was taking place. a source close to ornato told fox news' david spunt after hutchinson's testimony that ornato was shocked when hutchinson made the allegation about the steering wheel. that source said both ornato and secret service agent robert engel would be willing to testify to the committee to refute that part of hutchinson's story. aguilar said on thursday that the committee was investigating potential 'obstruction' of justice related to the allegation. haris alic is a politics reporter for fox news digital

'insurrection is a term of art, defined in the law itinvolves taking over a country,a shadow government, taking the tv stations over and having some plan on what you're going to do when you finally take power. clearly,this is not that.' castor said trump and his entire legal team denouncethe violence that day and believe the actions of individual criminals were 'horrific.' still, they argued trump had nothing to do with inciting violence and his true supporters understand he wouldn't want that. 'president trump is the most pro-police, anti-mob-rule president,' castor said, pointing to trump's previous statements where he denounced rioters burning down cities last summer. 'his real supporters know this. he made it clear throughout his presidency.' senate gop leader mitch mcconnell and other republicans, however, have characterized the attack on the capitol as an insurrection. 'this failed attempt to obstruct the congress, this failed insurrection, only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic,' mcconnell said on jan. 6after the attack. trump lawyers also argued theformer president's political speech is protected by the first amendment andhis words on jan. 6 to his supporters to 'fight like hell' were not meantliterally. to drive home that point, trump's defense played an 11-minute video of nearly every democrat in the chamber using the words 'fight' in their past speeches and interviews. democrats panned the move as a false equivalency and an effort to downplay trump's overarching actions to tella'big lie' about the election being stolen and to summon amob to washington to disrupt a peaceful transfer of power. 'the focus is on what he did, not what everybody else did or said,'sen. mazie hirono, d-hawaii, said. 'it was so childish. it was, to me, just totally pathetic and amateurish.' 'president’s lawyers blew the house manager’s case out of the water,' tweeted sen. ron johnson, r-wis. 'legally eviscerated them.' trump's team painted the trial as a political witchhunt designed to silence trump and his supporters. 'this trial is about far more than president trump,' castor said.

'the president’s threat to america is urgent, and so too will be our action,' pelosi said. house majority leader stenyhoyer, later,said the house would meet at 9 a.m. on wednesday to consider thearticleof impeachment. 'in his conduct while president of the united states—and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the united states, and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, donald john trump engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the government of the united states,' the article reads. the article alleges that before jan. 6, the joint session of congress to certify the presidential election results, trump 'repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the american people or certified by state or federal officials.' the article claims that before the jan. 6 joint sessionthe president addressed a crowd in washington where he 'reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide,' and 'willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged--and forseeably resulted in--lawless action at the capitol.' the article refers to trump's statement: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.' 'thus incited by president trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere with the joint session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, unlawfully breached and vandalized the capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced members of congress, the vice president and congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,' the article states. the article adds that trump's conduct 'followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election,' referring to his phone call earlier this month with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, where he pressured him to 'find' enough votes to overturn the state's election results. 'in all this, president trump gravely endangered the security of the united states and its institutions of government,' the article states. 'he threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government.' the article adds that he 'betrayed his trust as president, to the manifest injury of the people of the united states.' 'donald john trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the united states,' it said. the calls for trump’s removal come after the president spoke at a rally wednesday, telling supporters that he would 'never concede,' and repeated unsubstantiated claims that the election was 'stolen' from him and that he won in a 'landslide.' during his remarks, he renewed pressure on pence, claiming that he should decertify the results of the presidential election and send it 'back to the states,' claiming that if he did that, trump would be president for another four years. trump’s remarks came ahead of a joint session of congress to certify the results of the presidential election. as members of the house and senate raised objections to certain electoral votes, both chambers called for a recess and left their chambers as pro-trump protesters breached the capitol building. washington, d.c., police said the security breach at the capitol resulted in four deaths –including a woman who had been shot inside the building –and at least 70 arrests. congress later returned and certified the electoral college vote early thursday, formally giving joe biden his presidential victory. white house deputy chief of staff dan scavino posted a statement from the president on twitter early thursday morning, saying: 'even though i totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on january 20th.' 'i have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,'trump said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/pelosi-democrats-need-trump-jan-6-commission-liz-peek,FOX,"Liz Peek: Pelosi, Democrats need Trump – Jan. 6 commission created for this one reason",It isn’t just Democrat politicians that miss our former president; their partners in the media are dying without Trump.,"July 12, 2021 5:00am EDT","rep. byron donalds says pelosi is using jan. 6 as a political cudgel on 'the ingraham angle' a pro-biden super pac just sent out a plea for help, telling supporters that voters are oblivious to the president’s achievements and that democrats need to 'communicate much more aggressively' about his agenda or face serious losses in the midterms. with all due respect to biden’s agenda, he isn’t donald j. trump. with trump muted, that’s no longer good enough.  it isn’t just democrat politicians that miss our former president; their partners in the media are dying without trump. ratings for cnn and msnbc have cratered; the audience for cnn’s jake tapper has plummeted 75% from january. tapper can’t wait for pelosi’s 'insurrection' hearings. the left’s problem is that trump is practically invisible today. liberals applaud facebook, youtube and twitter for taking the donald off their platforms, and it surely has reduced his impact. but those social media giants have in fact done democrats a huge disservice. instead of railing about trump’s latest disruptive tweet, pelosi and presidentjoe biden have to talk about the chaos at the border, or their push to spend even more trillions of dollars, despite the worst inflation in decades. they have to explain why gasoline prices are up more than 30%, or why crime is soaring in democrat-led cities.they have to tell us why american kids are being brainwashed into thinking that all that matters is the color of their skin. democrat leaders like pelosi andbiden are cowed by a sliver of their party that champions policies most americans dislike, like open borders, critical race theory and lax voting rules. their way is not the american way. already, after just a few months in control of congress and the white house, democrats are playing defense. biden’s far-left agenda looks dead in the water thanks to some moderates in congress whose constituents are alarmed at the prospect of higher taxes, giant budget deficits and immoderate payoffs to democrat special-interest groups. what will democrats sell to voters in 2022? that’s where nancy’s commission comes in. she wants to return to the 2020 playbook, in which trump is the bogeyman. in particular, she wants to alarm the country that we are at mortal risk from violent extremists – i.e. trump supporters – of the kind that breached the capitol on jan. 6. she wants to play up the 'insurrection' narrative, and has the fbi toiling to back her up. the agency, displaying the kind of fervor conspicuously lacking in dealing with the blm riots a year ago, has so far hunted down and arrested more than 535 people who approached or crowded into the halls of congress. make no mistake: the attack on the capitol was horrendous and should never have happened. but pelosi’s inquiry may raise uncomfortable questions, and could backfire. for instance, the fbi has pursued charges against several members of the oath keepers,which the fbi calls a 'loosely connected group of individuals' for 'conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding.'but a new york times article reports that the leader of the oath keepers, stewart rhodes, has spoken voluntarily with the fbi and that 'prosecutors overseeing the investigation of mr. rhodes have long admitted that they have struggled to make a case against him. his activities seemed to stay within the boundaries of the first amendment, one official with knowledgeof the investigation said. what if many of the more than 535fall into the same category? also, people may demand to know who shot ashley babbitt, an unarmed trump supporter who was the only person killed that day. with cops being hounded from coast to coast for any questionable use of force, it is outrageous that federal prosecutors determined the killing was justified and declined to press charges, even as they refused to identify the shooter. also, why were repeated requests to call in the national guard ahead of the rally turned down?the former chief of u.s. capitol police told the washington post that security officials at the house and senate rebuffed his early entreaties to call in the national guard. was pelosi behind that decision?

'it was a travesty in american history, a shocking attack on our democratic values and institutions,' the judge said. 'all who participated in that insurrection, i think it can be called, must be held responsible.' ayres said he has lost friends, family and a job after he joined the jan. 6 attack. 'i pray every day for the officers that are struggling with this, the families that lost their loved ones,' ayres said. 'i just hope one day i can wake up and not have to live with it every day.' prosecutors recommended sentencing ayres to 60 days of incarceration, one year of supervised release and 60 hours of community service. ayres' lawyer, eugene ohm, sought a sentence of probation without any jail time. ayres, 41, pleaded guilty in june to one count of disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in prison. he wasn't accused of engaging in any violence or property damage. ayres was charged with matthew perna, a friend from pennsylvania who joined him in washington. they attended the jan. 6 'stop the steal' rally, where then-president donald trump addressed a crowd of supporters. then they joined the mob's assault on the capitol, entering the building through the senate wing doors. perna died in february. he had pleaded guilty to riot-relayed charges in december and was scheduled to be sentenced in march. a filing notifying the court of perna’s death doesn’t specify a cause, but ayres' attorney said perna 'took his own life largely because of the pressures of this case.' 'mr. ayres thinks of mr. perna, who conveyed to him that he felt responsible that mr. ayres had been charged, every day. mr. ayres wonders whether and to what extent mr. ayres’ circumstances contributed to mr. perna’s depression,' ohm wrote. two attorneys who represented perna didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ayres was employed as a supervisor for a cabinet manufacturer when he was arrested at his home in warren, ohio, less than three weeks after the capitol attack. his employer fired him. during a july 12 hearing before the house committee investigating the jan. 6 insurrection, ayres testified that he felt as if trump had called him to washington that day. he said he believed that trump would join them at the capitol and held out hope that the 2020 presidential election results could be overturned in favor of the republican incumbent. 'i felt like i had like horse blinders on. i was locked in the whole time,' ayres said. ayres told committee members that he and others decided to leave the capitol right after trump tweeted at 4:17 p.m. for his supporters to go home. in a court filing accompanying his guilty plea, ayres agreed he stayed in the capitol for roughly 10 minutes. but his testimony about trump’s tweet indicates he actually remained in the building for approximately 90 minutes, according to prosecutors. at a separate hearing on thursday, u.s. district judge trevor mcfadden sentenced a former u.s. army reservist to four years in prison for storming the capitol, according to a justice department news release. prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of six years and six months for timothy hale-cusanelli, whom they described as a nazi sympathizer. at least 880 people have been charged with capitol riot-related federal crimes. approximately 400 of them have pleaded guilty and more than 250 have been",2022-09-22,-0.9752,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'ayres', 'apologized', 'thursday', 'court', 'people', 'district', 'judge', 'john', 'bates', 'sentenced', 'probation', 'ordered', 'perform', 'hours', 'community', 'service', 'travesty', 'american', 'history', 'shocking', 'attack', 'democratic', 'values', 'institutions', 'judge', 'participated', 'insurrection', 'think', 'called', 'must', 'held', 'responsible', 'ayres', 'lost', 'friends', 'family', 'job', 'joined', 'attack', 'pray', 'every', 'day', 'officers', 'struggling', 'families', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'ayres', 'hope', 'day', 'wake', 'live', 'every', 'day', 'prosecutors', 'recommended', 'sentencing', 'ayres', 'days', 'incarceration', 'year', 'supervised', 'release', 'hours', 'community', 'service', 'ayres', 'lawyer', 'eugene', 'ohm', 'sought', 'sentence', 'probation', 'without', 'jail', 'ayres', 'pleaded', 'guilty', 'june', 'count', 'disorderly', 'disruptive', 'conduct', 'restricted', 'building', 'grounds', 'misdemeanor', 'punishable', 'maximum', 'year', 'prison', 'accused', 'engaging', 'violence', 'property', 'damage', 'ayres', 'charged', 'matthew', 'perna', 'friend', 'pennsylvania', 'joined', 'washington', 'attended', 'steal', 'rally', 'donald', 'trump', 'addressed', 'crowd', 'supporters', 'joined', 'mob', 'assault', 'capitol', 'entering', 'building', 'senate', 'wing', 'doors', 'perna', 'died', 'february', 'pleaded', 'guilty', 'charges', 'december', 'scheduled', 'sentenced', 'march', 'filing', 'notifying', 'court', 'perna', 'death', 'specify', 'cause', 'ayres', 'attorney', 'perna', 'life', 'largely', 'pressures', 'case', 'ayres', 'thinks', 'perna', 'conveyed', 'felt', 'responsible', 'ayres', 'charged', 'every', 'day', 'ayres', 'wonders', 'whether', 'extent', 'ayres', 'circumstances', 'contributed', 'perna', 'depression', 'ohm', 'wrote', 'attorneys', 'represented', 'perna', 'immediately', 'respond', 'email', 'seeking', 'comment', 'ayres', 'employed', 'supervisor', 'cabinet', 'manufacturer', 'arrested', 'home', 'warren', 'ohio', 'less', 'three', 'weeks', 'capitol', 'attack', 'employer', 'fired', 'july', 'hearing', 'house', 'committee', 'investigating', 'insurrection', 'ayres', 'testified', 'felt', 'trump', 'called', 'washington', 'day', 'believed', 'trump', 'join', 'capitol', 'held', 'hope', 'presidential', 'election', 'results', 'overturned', 'favor', 'republican', 'incumbent', 'felt', 'like', 'like', 'horse', 'blinders', 'locked', 'whole', 'ayres', 'ayres', 'committee', 'members', 'others', 'decided', 'leave', 'capitol', 'right', 'trump', 'tweeted', 'supporters', 'go', 'home', 'court', 'filing', 'accompanying', 'guilty', 'plea', 'ayres', 'agreed', 'stayed', 'capitol', 'roughly', 'minutes', 'testimony', 'trump', 'tweet', 'indicates', 'actually', 'remained', 'building', 'approximately', 'minutes', 'according', 'prosecutors', 'separate', 'hearing', 'thursday', 'district', 'judge', 'trevor', 'mcfadden', 'sentenced', 'former', 'army', 'reservist', 'four', 'years', 'prison', 'storming', 'capitol', 'according', 'justice', 'department', 'news', 'release', 'prosecutors', 'recommended', 'prison', 'sentence', 'six', 'years', 'six', 'months', 'timothy', 'described', 'nazi', 'sympathizer', 'least', 'people', 'charged', 'capitol', 'federal', 'crimes', 'approximately', 'pleaded', 'guilty']"

'we aren’t getting through this without a civil war. prepare your mind body and spirit,' he wrote shortly after the 2020 election. a government witness — an oath keeper cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of a lighter sentence — testified that there was an 'implicit' agreement to stop congress’ certification but the decision to enter the building was 'spontaneous.' 'we talked about doing something about the fraud in the election before we went there on the 6th,' graydon young told jurors. 'and then when the crowd got over the barricade and they went into the building, an opportunity presented itself to do something. we didn’t tell each other that.' prosecutors say the defense is only trying to muddy the waters in a clear-cut case. the oath keepers aren’t accused of entering into an agreement ahead of jan. 6 to storm the capitol. defense attorneys for caldwell, watkins and harrelson worked on monday to cast doubt on the timeline presented by prosecutors, saying that communications were hampered by overwhelmed cell towers and that other rioters forced congress to recess before they arrived. prosecutor jeffrey nestler, though, said any lag was brief and the oath keepers were among the rioters who interrupted congressional proceedings by preventing lawmakers from coming back into session to certify the presidential vote. citing the civil war-era seditious conspiracy statute, prosecutors tried to prove the oath keepers conspired to forcibly oppose the authority of the federal government and block the execution of laws governing the transfer of presidential power. prosecutors must show the defendants agreed to use force — not merely advocated it — to oppose the transfer of presidential power.",2022-11-22,-0.9952,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'prosecutors', 'spent', 'weeks', 'showing', 'jurors', 'messages', 'recordings', 'surveillance', 'video', 'say', 'show', 'rhodes', 'granbury', 'texas', 'band', 'antigovernment', 'extremists', 'prepared', 'arms', 'overturn', 'biden', 'election', 'victory', 'trump', 'rhodes', 'thomas', 'caldwell', 'berryville', 'virginia', 'jessica', 'watkins', 'woodstock', 'ohio', 'took', 'witness', 'stand', 'sought', 'downplay', 'actions', 'portray', 'riot', 'spontaneous', 'outpouring', 'rage', 'instead', 'result', 'preconceived', 'plot', 'defendants', 'face', 'several', 'charges', 'including', 'conspiracy', 'obstruct', 'official', 'congress', 'certification', 'biden', 'election', 'win', 'rhodes', 'jurors', 'plan', 'oath', 'keepers', 'attack', 'capitol', 'followers', 'went', 'inside', 'acted', 'jury', 'weigh', 'charges', 'oath', 'keepers', 'whipped', 'impulsive', 'frenzy', 'trump', 'traveled', 'washington', 'intent', 'stopping', 'transfer', 'presidential', 'power', 'costs', 'riot', 'opportunity', 'preparing', 'prosecutors', 'say', 'rhodes', 'followers', 'sprang', 'action', 'marching', 'capitol', 'joining', 'crowd', 'pushing', 'building', 'attempting', 'overturn', 'election', 'sending', 'biden', 'white', 'house', 'place', 'trump', 'authorities', 'allege', 'true', 'oath', 'keepers', 'argue', 'say', 'never', 'plot', 'prosecutors', 'twisted', 'admittedly', 'bombastic', 'words', 'given', 'jurors', 'misleading', 'timeline', 'events', 'messages', 'hundreds', 'people', 'convicted', 'deadly', 'attack', 'left', 'dozens', 'officers', 'injured', 'sent', 'lawmakers', 'running', 'lives', 'shook', 'foundations', 'american', 'democracy', 'jurors', 'case', 'rhodes', 'associates', 'need', 'decide', 'whether', 'actions', 'defendants', 'amount', 'seditious', 'conspiracy', 'charge', 'carries', 'significant', 'prison', 'political', 'weight', 'oath', 'keepers', 'trial', 'prosecutors', 'built', 'case', 'using', 'dozens', 'encrypted', 'messages', 'sent', 'weeks', 'leading', 'show', 'rhodes', 'rallying', 'followers', 'fight', 'defend', 'trump', 'warning', 'might', 'need', 'insurrection', 'getting', 'without', 'civil', 'war', 'prepare', 'mind', 'body', 'spirit', 'wrote', 'shortly', 'election', 'government', 'witness', 'oath', 'keeper', 'cooperating', 'prosecutors', 'hopes', 'lighter', 'sentence', 'testified', 'agreement', 'stop', 'congress', 'certification', 'decision', 'enter', 'building', 'talked', 'something', 'fraud', 'election', 'went', 'graydon', 'young', 'jurors', 'crowd', 'got', 'barricade', 'went', 'building', 'opportunity', 'presented', 'something', 'tell', 'prosecutors', 'say', 'defense', 'trying', 'muddy', 'waters', 'case', 'oath', 'keepers', 'accused', 'entering', 'agreement', 'ahead', 'storm', 'capitol', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'caldwell', 'watkins', 'harrelson', 'worked', 'monday', 'cast', 'doubt', 'timeline', 'presented', 'prosecutors', 'saying', 'communications', 'hampered', 'overwhelmed', 'cell', 'towers', 'rioters', 'forced', 'congress', 'recess', 'arrived', 'prosecutor', 'jeffrey', 'nestler', 'though', 'lag', 'brief', 'oath', 'keepers', 'among', 'rioters', 'interrupted', 'congressional', 'proceedings', 'preventing', 'lawmakers', 'coming', 'back', 'session', 'certify', 'presidential', 'vote', 'citing', 'civil', 'seditious', 'conspiracy', 'statute', 'prosecutors', 'tried', 'prove', 'oath', 'keepers', 'conspired', 'forcibly', 'oppose', 'authority', 'federal', 'government', 'block', 'execution', 'laws', 'governing', 'transfer', 'presidential', 'power', 'prosecutors', 'must', 'show', 'defendants', 'agreed', 'use', 'force', 'merely', 'advocated', 'oppose', 'transfer', 'presidential', 'power']"

'these people came specifically with equipment. you’re bringing climbing gear to a demonstration, explosives, chemical spray – you’re coming prepared,' sund testified. 'the fact that the group attacked our west front 20 minutes before the event at the ellipse ended – they were planning on our agency not being at full strength at that time.' sund was pointing to former president trump’s rally, which took place at the ellipse near the white house just before the riots began. sund added that u.s. capitol police were 'dealing with two pipe bombs, specifically set right off the edge of our perimeter to draw resources away.' 'i think there was a significant coordination with this attack,' sund said. contee also said rioters used 'hand signals and radio communication,' as well as a 'coordinated use' of chemicals. 'i certainly believe it was coordinated,' contee said, pointing to the 'placement of pipe bombs in the area, all of those things, and plus, adding to what we know in hindsight, now, as a result of the ongoing investigation of the fbi.' 'as they continue to scrub social media, we are learning more and more and more that this is clearly a coordinated effort,' contee said. and irving agreed. 'based on the information provided by contee and sund, i would agree,' irving said. 'the evidence would indicate a coordinated attack.' peters said that extremist groups, like the oath keepers and proud boys, have been identified in intelligence reports, and that the committee plans to hold future hearings to discuss that intelligence. the capitol riot followed trump’s rally, in which he encouraged his supporters to protest biden's electoral college certification. trump told his followers during that speechto protest 'peacefully and patriotically,' but critics have said that one off-hand comment does not outweigh the balance of his rhetoric in the lengthy jan. 6 speech or in the preceding weeks, in which he said the rally would be 'wild.' rioters had been around the capitol for most of the day on jan. 6, but they finally breached the building as their numbers grew about an hour after trump's speech concluded. trump was acquitted by the senate earlier this month after a weeklong trial, following the house of representatives on jan. 13 voting to impeach him on one article –inciting insurrection –in connection withthe capitol riot on jan. 6. trump was the first president in u.s.history to be impeached twiceand the first president out of office to go through an impeachment proceeding. trump was acquitted, with57 senators voting for his conviction –short of the required two-thirds majority –and 43 voting against. brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",2021-02-23,0.7184,Very Positive,"['committee', 'chairman', 'gary', 'peters', 'questioned', 'officials', 'whether', 'believedthere', 'coordination', 'regard', 'attack', 'people', 'came', 'specifically', 'equipment', 'bringing', 'climbing', 'gear', 'demonstration', 'explosives', 'chemical', 'spray', 'coming', 'prepared', 'sund', 'testified', 'fact', 'group', 'attacked', 'west', 'front', 'minutes', 'event', 'ellipse', 'ended', 'planning', 'agency', 'full', 'strength', 'sund', 'pointing', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'rally', 'took', 'place', 'ellipse', 'near', 'white', 'house', 'riots', 'began', 'sund', 'added', 'capitol', 'police', 'pipe', 'bombs', 'specifically', 'set', 'right', 'edge', 'perimeter', 'draw', 'resources', 'away', 'think', 'significant', 'coordination', 'attack', 'sund', 'contee', 'rioters', 'used', 'signals', 'radio', 'communication', 'well', 'use', 'chemicals', 'certainly', 'believe', 'coordinated', 'contee', 'pointing', 'pipe', 'bombs', 'area', 'things', 'plus', 'adding', 'hindsight', 'result', 'ongoing', 'investigation', 'fbi', 'continue', 'scrub', 'social', 'media', 'learning', 'clearly', 'coordinated', 'effort', 'contee', 'irving', 'agreed', 'information', 'provided', 'contee', 'sund', 'agree', 'irving', 'evidence', 'indicate', 'coordinated', 'attack', 'peters', 'extremist', 'groups', 'like', 'oath', 'keepers', 'proud', 'boys', 'identified', 'intelligence', 'reports', 'committee', 'plans', 'hold', 'future', 'hearings', 'discuss', 'intelligence', 'capitol', 'riot', 'followed', 'trump', 'rally', 'encouraged', 'supporters', 'protest', 'biden', 'electoral', 'college', 'certification', 'trump', 'followers', 'speechto', 'protest', 'patriotically', 'critics', 'comment', 'outweigh', 'balance', 'rhetoric', 'lengthy', 'speech', 'preceding', 'weeks', 'rally', 'rioters', 'around', 'capitol', 'day', 'finally', 'breached', 'building', 'numbers', 'grew', 'hour', 'trump', 'speech', 'concluded', 'trump', 'acquitted', 'senate', 'earlier', 'month', 'weeklong', 'trial', 'following', 'house', 'representatives', 'voting', 'impeach', 'article', 'insurrection', 'connection', 'withthe', 'capitol', 'riot', 'trump', 'president', 'impeached', 'twiceand', 'president', 'office', 'go', 'impeachment', 'proceeding', 'trump', 'acquitted', 'senators', 'voting', 'conviction', 'required', 'majority', 'voting', 'brooke', 'singman', 'news', 'digital', 'politics', 'reporter', 'reach', 'brookesingman', 'twitter']"

'today, what we are seeing on this committee is an attempt by my friends on the other side of the aisle to continue demonizing school boards, local school boards, local school board members, school administrators, parents and teachers. these school board meetings have become a place where maga extremists go to disrupt based on false and deceptive information imparted to them by the former president and his maga extremist followers, deception about what’s being taught to our children,' johnson said. he added, 'it’s really a travesty that we come today in congress just a couple of months before a very important election that my maga supports on the other side of the aisle are intent on winning so they can take control of this body and then they will have the ability to harass and try to intimidate the administration with their oversight powers.' he later compared parents who protested school board meetings to the jan. 6 capitol riots 'january 6, 2021, will never be forgotten, an infamous day in american history. maga republicans descended upon the capitol, engaged in an insurrection. they occupied the capitol. five people were killed, hundreds injured, including hundreds of capitol hill police officers attacked and bludgeoned. it was a day that we’ll never forget,' the lawmaker said.

'and in response to that, the national school boards association sent a letter to the biden administration seeking federal help. things had gotten so far out of hand. and by the way, there is not one scintilla of evidence, either direct or indirect, that there was any coordination between the biden administration and the national school boards association that caused that letter to be sent seeking federal assistance,' johnson said. however, he later admitted that the memo was 'indicating that there was going to be some coordination between the federal government and local governments to maintain order at school board meetings.' since president biden’s condemnation of 'maga republicans' as a threat to democracy, democrats, including the president, have been vague on who falls under that category, instead pointing to broader issues such as pro-life policies. lindsay kornick is an associate editor for fox news digital. story tips can be sent to lindsay.kornick@fox.com and on twitter: @lmkornick.",2022-09-14,-0.989,Very Negative,"['hank', 'johnson', 'compared', 'parents', 'protested', 'school', 'board', 'meetings', 'republicans', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'committee', 'hearing', 'instead', 'discussing', 'potential', 'coordination', 'johnson', 'attacked', 'parent', 'protestors', 'extremists', 'criticized', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'bringing', 'topic', 'seeing', 'committee', 'attempt', 'friends', 'side', 'aisle', 'continue', 'demonizing', 'school', 'boards', 'local', 'school', 'boards', 'local', 'school', 'board', 'members', 'school', 'administrators', 'parents', 'teachers', 'school', 'board', 'meetings', 'become', 'place', 'maga', 'extremists', 'go', 'disrupt', 'based', 'false', 'deceptive', 'information', 'imparted', 'former', 'president', 'maga', 'extremist', 'followers', 'deception', 'taught', 'children', 'johnson', 'added', 'really', 'travesty', 'come', 'today', 'congress', 'couple', 'months', 'important', 'election', 'maga', 'supports', 'side', 'aisle', 'intent', 'winning', 'control', 'body', 'ability', 'harass', 'try', 'intimidate', 'administration', 'oversight', 'powers', 'later', 'compared', 'parents', 'protested', 'school', 'board', 'meetings', 'capitol', 'riots', 'never', 'forgotten', 'infamous', 'day', 'american', 'history', 'maga', 'republicans', 'descended', 'upon', 'capitol', 'engaged', 'insurrection', 'occupied', 'capitol', 'five', 'people', 'killed', 'hundreds', 'injured', 'including', 'hundreds', 'capitol', 'hill', 'police', 'officers', 'attacked', 'bludgeoned', 'day', 'never', 'forget', 'lawmaker', 'people', 'local', 'level', 'affected', 'school', 'board', 'meetings', 'forget', 'maga', 'republicans', 'descending', 'school', 'board', 'meetings', 'january', 'like', 'january', 'disrupting', 'meetings', 'coordinated', 'attack', 'happening', 'across', 'country', 'americans', 'forget', 'school', 'board', 'members', 'teachers', 'administrators', 'subjected', 'violence', 'threats', 'violence', 'harassment', 'intimidation', 'response', 'national', 'school', 'boards', 'association', 'sent', 'letter', 'biden', 'administration', 'seeking', 'federal', 'help', 'things', 'gotten', 'far', 'hand', 'way', 'scintilla', 'evidence', 'either', 'direct', 'indirect', 'coordination', 'biden', 'administration', 'national', 'school', 'boards', 'association', 'caused', 'letter', 'sent', 'seeking', 'federal', 'assistance', 'johnson', 'however', 'later', 'admitted', 'memo', 'coordination', 'federal', 'government', 'local', 'governments', 'maintain', 'order', 'school', 'board', 'meetings', 'since', 'president', 'biden', 'condemnation', 'republicans', 'threat', 'democracy', 'democrats', 'including', 'president', 'vague', 'falls', 'category', 'instead', 'pointing', 'broader', 'issues', 'policies', 'lindsay', 'kornick', 'associate', 'editor', 'news', 'digital', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter', 'lmkornick']"

'but does the president have responsibility too, senator?' she asked. 'of course,' scott responded, adding, 'i would say we all have the most responsibility for our own words.' 'this is easy for us to put the blame on someone else,' he added. king earlier remarked that trump had yet to 'take responsibility' for the riot and cited rioters who claimed they went to the capitol that day because the former president called them there. 'doesn't the president have power? don't his words have power, and shouldn't he be more careful with his words?' king asked. 'yes,' scott responded, dismissing king's subsequent notion that trump knew his supporters were armed. 'i don't think anyone knows that the crowd was armed when the call to come to the capitol was put out there,' he said. he also touched on the controversial fbi raid of the former president's residence at mar-a-lago, saying the focus remains on trump because he is the 'most powerful' political figure in the u.s. when asked about alleged partisanship among the fbi, scott answered that partisanship concerns have surfaced in the past. 'there have been a lot of questions before this raid about whether the fbi is doing its job apolitically, and we don't know the answer to that yet,' he said. 'this is going to raise more questions. in my opinion, we need to let this play out… but we all should have been stunned, surprised and shocked by what happened yesterday,' he said. scott added that the grounds for the investigation should have 'considerable magnitude' or the development could leave a 'very big mess.' taylor penley is a production assistant with fox news.",2022-08-09,0.6535,Very Positive,"['tim', 'scott', 'sounded', 'fbi', 'raid', 'capitol', 'riot', 'issues', 'mornings', 'tuesday', 'president', 'responsibility', 'senator', 'asked', 'course', 'scott', 'responded', 'adding', 'say', 'responsibility', 'words', 'easy', 'us', 'put', 'blame', 'someone', 'else', 'added', 'king', 'earlier', 'remarked', 'trump', 'yet', 'responsibility', 'riot', 'cited', 'rioters', 'claimed', 'went', 'capitol', 'day', 'former', 'president', 'called', 'president', 'power', 'words', 'power', 'careful', 'words', 'king', 'asked', 'scott', 'responded', 'dismissing', 'king', 'subsequent', 'notion', 'trump', 'knew', 'supporters', 'armed', 'think', 'anyone', 'knows', 'crowd', 'armed', 'call', 'come', 'capitol', 'put', 'touched', 'controversial', 'fbi', 'raid', 'former', 'president', 'residence', 'saying', 'focus', 'remains', 'trump', 'powerful', 'political', 'figure', 'asked', 'alleged', 'partisanship', 'among', 'fbi', 'scott', 'answered', 'partisanship', 'concerns', 'surfaced', 'past', 'lot', 'questions', 'raid', 'whether', 'fbi', 'job', 'apolitically', 'answer', 'yet', 'raise', 'questions', 'opinion', 'need', 'play', 'stunned', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'happened', 'yesterday', 'scott', 'added', 'grounds', 'investigation', 'magnitude', 'development', 'leave', 'big', 'mess', 'taylor', 'penley', 'production', 'assistant', 'news']"

(the 82-year-old pelosi, by the way, tested positive for covid-19 yesterday.) trump again denied destroying call logs or using a burner phone during that 7-hour gap in his recorded calls, a story that’s been largely debunked. 'i don’t remember getting very many… why would i care about who called me? if congressmen were calling me, what difference did it make? there was nothing secretive about it. there was no secret.' when trump did put out a video later that day, he told the mob: 'go home. we love you. you’re very special.' many others are defying committee subpoenas, and the house just voted to hold two ex-aides–peter navarro and dan scavino–in criminal contempt. but is this all a slow-motion charade? the justice department still hasn’t acted on a criminal referral from december for former chief of staff mark meadows. the only person who’s been charged with contempt is steve bannon. also yesterday, new york attorney general letitia james asked that trump be held in contempt for not turning over documents under subpoena. keep in mind that this is a civil case from the democratic ag–james hasn’t even brought charges–but she is asking for fines of $10,000 a day. to give you a sense of the contempt debate on the hill, panel chairman bennie thompson said that navarro and scavino 'must be held accountable for their defiance of the law.' but republican rep. jim banks accused the dems of 'abusing the seat of our democracy to attack american democracy.' merrick garland’s department is looking into the 15 boxes of white house records, some marked top secret, that trump took to mar-a-lago, the post reported in a separate piece. meanwhile, a federal judge appointed by trump has acquitted matthew martin of new mexico of disorderly conduct charges for entering the capitol on jan. 6. his defense was that a police officer had waved him in, which prosecutors called nonsense. martin said he 'enjoyed the day… it was a magical day in many ways.' he did add that 'i know some bad things happened.' that’s kind of an understatement. and what’s even worse is that the country remains deeply divided over what happened, who is to blame, and whether trump–who the post says refuses to abandon 'the fantastical idea he could be reinstated'–bears some responsibility.",2022-04-08,-0.993,Very Negative,"['seeking', 'release', 'dirt', 'bidens', 'harbor', 'country', 'together', 'ripping', 'apart', 'excuse', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'watching', 'riot', 'television', 'refusing', 'appeals', 'aides', 'ivanka', 'speak', 'minutes', 'assumed', 'someone', 'else', 'taking', 'care', 'pelosi', 'way', 'tested', 'positive', 'yesterday', 'trump', 'denied', 'destroying', 'call', 'logs', 'using', 'burner', 'phone', 'gap', 'recorded', 'calls', 'story', 'largely', 'debunked', 'remember', 'getting', 'care', 'called', 'congressmen', 'calling', 'difference', 'make', 'nothing', 'secretive', 'secret', 'trump', 'put', 'video', 'later', 'day', 'mob', 'home', 'love', 'special', 'many', 'others', 'defying', 'committee', 'subpoenas', 'house', 'voted', 'hold', 'navarro', 'dan', 'criminal', 'contempt', 'charade', 'justice', 'department', 'still', 'acted', 'criminal', 'referral', 'december', 'former', 'chief', 'staff', 'mark', 'meadows', 'person', 'charged', 'contempt', 'steve', 'bannon', 'yesterday', 'new', 'york', 'attorney', 'general', 'letitia', 'james', 'asked', 'trump', 'held', 'contempt', 'turning', 'documents', 'subpoena', 'keep', 'mind', 'civil', 'case', 'democratic', 'even', 'brought', 'asking', 'fines', 'day', 'give', 'sense', 'contempt', 'debate', 'hill', 'panel', 'chairman', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'navarro', 'scavino', 'held', 'accountable', 'defiance', 'law', 'republican', 'jim', 'banks', 'accused', 'dems', 'seat', 'democracy', 'attack', 'american', 'democracy', 'merrick', 'garland', 'department', 'looking', 'boxes', 'white', 'house', 'records', 'marked', 'top', 'secret', 'trump', 'took', 'post', 'reported', 'separate', 'piece', 'meanwhile', 'federal', 'judge', 'appointed', 'trump', 'acquitted', 'matthew', 'martin', 'new', 'mexico', 'disorderly', 'conduct', 'charges', 'entering', 'capitol', 'defense', 'police', 'officer', 'waved', 'prosecutors', 'called', 'nonsense', 'martin', 'magical', 'day', 'many', 'ways', 'add', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'kind', 'understatement', 'even', 'worse', 'country', 'remains', 'deeply', 'divided', 'happened', 'blame', 'whether', 'post', 'says', 'refuses', 'abandon', 'fantastical', 'idea', 'responsibility']"

'all of us must answer that question today.' swalwell, d-calif., serves on the house permanent select committee on intelligence and on the house judiciary committee. swalwell is a former prosecutor and is serving his fifth term in congress. upon being appointed a house manager, swalwell said that 'america is under an attack incited by president donald trump.' 'lives have been lost and future plans are in place to stop a transition of power,' swalwell said. 'a president's greatest responsibility is to protect american lives and defend american ideals. donald trump has failed to do both.' swalwell was also in contention to serve as an impeachment manager during trump’s first senate impeachment trial in 2020. plaskett serves on the house ways and means committee. before she was elected to congress, she served as an assistant district attorney in the bronx district attorney’s office and as senior counsel at the department of justice. she is serving her fourth term in congress. upon being named a house manager, plaskett said she was 'humbled and honored to be given the sacred responsibility.'

'those lies and dangers found themselves inside this capitol. this hateful rhetoric is another virus — it is time to remove its host.' neguse, d-colo., is a member of the house judiciary committee and the natural resources committee and the select committee on the climate crisis. neguse, early in his career, was a litigator in private practice. he is serving his second term in congress. neguse was an early supporter of impeaching trump, and supported efforts to impeach him since 2018 when he was elected to congress. 'president trump’s actions – encouraging, inciting a mob that stormed the united states capitol, for the sole purpose of stopping the constitutionally-mandated counting of electoral votes – cannot go unanswered by this body,' neguse said last month.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-government-agents-helped-organize-capitol-riot,FOX,Tucker Carlson: Government agents may have helped organize the Jan. 6 Capitol riot,Tucker Carlson investigates a new report suggesting the FBI may have been involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot.,"June 16, 2021 12:57am EDT","'tucker carlson tonight' host says there is an 'unprecedented' effort to 'round up' dissenters but that’s not what our leaders are doing. they’re doing just the opposite. they’re working hard to divide us into warring camps with lies. they’re telling us a story that is completely — and very much intentionally — disconnected from reality. they’re claiming that something called white supremacy, a term they never define, is the greatest threat we face. a greater threat than al qaeda or isis. our thoroughly craven attorney general told us that very lie today. that was the attorney general of the united states stating a fact backed up by the fbi. so it’s fair to ask the obvious questions. under normal circumstances, we wouldn’t quote a foreign adversary criticizing our government, but honestly, those are entirely fair questions. who did shoot ashli babbit? why don’t we know? are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? that’s ok now? no, it’s not ok. it will never be ok. and why are all those january 6th protesters still in prison on trespassing charges, while so many biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? what’s the answer to that question? if that happened in russia, we rightly call it scary. we’d call putin a dictator. in fact, we do call him a dictator.  we ought to be asking those questions, urgently. because as the attorney general reminded us, a lot depends on the answers. at least one news organization is. revolver.news is a new site and turned out to be one of the last honest outlets on the internet. a new piece on the site suggests an answer to some of these questions. we know the government is hiding the identity of many law enforcement officers who were present at the capitol on january 6, not just the one who killed ashli babbitt. according to the government's own court filings, those law enforcement officers participated in the riot.sometimes in violent ways. we know that because, without fail, the government has thrown the book at most of the people who were in the capitol on january 6. there was a nationwide dragnet to find them. many of them are still in solitary confinement tonight. but, strangely, some people who participated in the riot haven't been charged. look at the documents. the government calls these people 'unindicted co-conspirators.' what does that mean? it means that in potentially every case, they're fbi operatives. for example, one of those 'unindicted co-conspirators' is someone the government identifies only as 'person two.' according to those documents, 'person two' stayed in the same hotel room as an 'insurrectionist' named thomas caldwell, who's alleged to be a member of the group called the oath keepers. 'person two' also 'stormed the barricades' at the capitol on january 6, alongside thomas caldwell. the government's indictments further indicate that caldwell -- who by the way is a 65-year-old man -- was led to believe there would be a 'quick reaction force' also participating in january 6. that quick reaction force, caldwell was told, would be led by someone called 'person three' -- who had a hotel room and an accomplice.  but wait. here’s the interesting thing. 'person two' and 'person three' were organizers of the riot. the government knows who they are, but the government has not charged them. why is that? you know why. they were almost certainly working for the fbi. so fbi operatives were organizing the attack on the capitol on january 6, according to government documents. and those two are not alone. in all, revolver news reported that there are,quote, 'upwards of 20 unindicted co-conspirators in the oath keeper indictments, all playing various roles in the conspiracy, who have not been charged for virtually the exact same activities — and in some cases much, much more severe activities — as those named alongside them in indictments.'  huh? so it turns out this white supremacist insurrection was, again, by the government’s own admission in these documents, organized, at least in part, by government agents. are you shocked? you shouldn't be. in march, the fbi director admitted the bureau is infiltrating as many dissident groups as it possibly could. wait a second – there’s a huge difference between using an informant to find out what a group you find threatening might do, and paying people to organize a violent action, which is what happened, apparently according to government documents, on january 6. the mastermind, the bureau said, was a man called adam fox. who was adam fox? he turned out to be a homeless guy who was living in the basement of a vacuum repair shop. the whole story was a farce. insulting really. but if you read the government's charging documents carefully, and you should, you'll see that it gets even more ridiculous. it turns out that one of the five people in the planned 'gretchen whitmer kidnap van' was an fbi agent. in the van. another was an fbi informant. the feds admit that an informant or undercover agent was 'usually present' in the group’s meetings. in other words, nearly half the gang of kidnappers were working for the fbi. remember the guy who suggested using a bomb to blow up a bridge as part of the plot? that got a lot of coverage. that guy was an undercover fbi agent. if you wondered why they're always comparing january 6 to 9/11, there's your answer. they're using the same tactics. and a lot of us missed this the first time around. we didn’t see the obvious. if you empower the government to violate civil liberties in pursuit of a foreign terror organization, and there are foreign terror organizations, it’s just a matter of time before ambitious politicians use those same mechanisms to suppress political dissent. that’s what we’re seeing now. we should have seen it earlier. trevor aaronson's book 'the terror factory' analyzed every terrorism prosecution from 2001 to 2013. aaronson found that at least 50 defendants were on trial because of behavior that the fbi had not only encouraged, but enabled. fbi agents were essentially the plotters in these crimes. they made the crimes, crimes.  in 2012, a writer for the nation called petra bartosiewicz found that fbi informants had quote, 'crossed the line from merely observing potential criminal behavior, which is allowed and good, to encouraging and assisting people to participate in plots that are largely scripted by the fbi itself.' and we checked. we looked carefully, and that’s not an exaggeration. one of those plots was an islamic terrorist attack in 2015 in garland texas. it turns out the fbi played an active role in that shooting. so they’re doing that to islamic radicals, what are they doing to american citizens? that should worry you. in a moment of uncharacteristic honesty, a former fbi assistant director calledfrank figliuzzi explained on msnbc. the goal is to round up political dissenters and throw them in solitary -- including members of congress. why not round up the fbi operatives who were rioting on january 6? why not identify the guy who killed ashli babbit? this is crazy, and we should resist it.",2021-06-16,-0.9985,Very Negative,"['carlson',

'the root cause of the uscp’s failure on january 6th was a failure of leadership. i think the senators saw that dysfunction on display today,' papathanasiou said. 'instead of cohesive leadership, we heard stenger, irving and former chief sund give contradicting accounts about the department’s handling of requests for backup from the national guard. it’s maddening.' during a line of questioning by sen. roy blunt, r-mo., sund and irving could not agree on when national guard assistance was requested. sund said he submitted the request at 1:09 p.m. on jan. 6. but irving insisted he did not receive the request for national guard support until after 2 p.m. while in former stenger’s office. when pressed, irving said he took a call from sund beforehand while on the congress floor but did not view the conversation as a formal request for national guard support. blunt ran out of time, and sen. ron johnson, r-wis., who was tapped next to question witnesses, suggested that phone records be dug up in the future to clarify that timeline. sund'admits that he did not see critical intelligence leading up to the insurrection. that intelligence should have been driving a more robust force posture,'papathanasiou said.'even after this hearing, we still don’t know why rank-and-file officers were not fully briefed on the threats that our leadership already knew were looming.' 'this is a report that i am just learning about within the last, they informed me yesterday of the report,' sund said. to that, sen. gary peters, d-mich., asked, 'how can you not get that vital intelligence on the eve of what's going to be a major event?' sund said the information was 'coming in as raw data' and admitted that it would have been helpful to have had the memo in advance. papathanasiou said u.s. capitol police officers who responded to the insurrection 'paid a horrible price for our leadership’s failures' and lost capitol police officer brian sicknick, who the department said died from injuries sustained at the riot, as well capitol police officer howard liebengood and metropolitan policeofficer jeffrey smith, who both 'have tragically taken their own lives.' 'we credit stenger, irving and sund for having the decency to resign,' papathanasiou said. 'however, acting chief pittman and her entire leadership team must also be replaced.' the union recently held a vote of no confidence on the current leadership, and officers voted overwhelmingly that the u.s. capitol police needs new leaders. in pittman’s case, 92% of the officers voted against her continuing to be acting chief or chief. 'the current leadership has lost the trust of the front-line officers. we know what these individuals failed to do prior to the insurrection, and we know what they failed to do during the insurrection,' papathanasiou said. 'the trust they have lost, cannot be regained. if we are going to address the systemic failures that led to the security breach, we need new leaders. new leaders that will ensure we have the proper training and equipment needed.'  'congress must find out the entirety of what went wrong and establish the steps needed to secure the capitol complex,' the union leader continued, thanking sens. amy klobuchar, d-minn., rob portman, r-ohio, blunt andpeters for holding the joint hearing he hoped will be the first of many. 'the number of threats continues to rise, not decline. members of congress must be able to safely carry out the duties entrusted to them by the american people, no matter what threats they face.' providing a first-hand account of police response to the u.s. capitol, capitol police capt. carneysha mendoza said at the hearing tuesday that she suffered burns on her faceas officers inside the building on jan. 6 were doused with gas sprayed by rioters.  'i proceeded to the rotunda where i noticed a heavy smoke-like residue and smelled what i believed to be military-grade cs gas -- a familiar smell,' mendoza, who served in the u.s. army, said. 'it was mixed with fire extinguisher spray deployed by the rioters. the rioters continued to deploy cs inside the rotunda.' 'officers received a lot of gas exposure, which is a lot worse inside the building versus outside, because there's nowhere for it to go,' she continued.'i received chemical burns to my face that still have not healed to this day.' as congress continues to seek clarity on the planning and events that unfolded in washington, d.c., on jan. 6, the u.s. capitol police released a separate statement tuesday to correct 'misinformation' in the media about the officer who shot and killed ashli babbitt, a 35-year-old air force veteran and trump supporter, inside the capitol building as rioters stormed the building. 'as the investigation continues into the events of january 6, 2021, it’s important to correct misinformation some in the media have reported, and that’s been shared on social media,' the agency said in a press release. 'reports identifying special agent david bailey as the officer involved in the shooting in the speaker’s lobby are inaccurate. the department will share additional information once the investigation is complete.' danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police and more. story tips can be sent to danielle.wallace@fox.com and on twitter:

'how many fbi agents or confidential informants actively participated in the events of jan. 6?' cruz asked. sanborn said in response that she could not discuss 'the specifics of sources and methods' of the fbi. cruz then broadened his question by asking if any fbi agents or confidential informants actively participated in the riot. 'sir, i can’t answer that,' she said. cruz then asked if any agents or confidential informants committed crimes of violence on jan. 6. when he received the same answer, he asked if any agents or confidential informants 'actively encouraged' crimes of violence on jan. 6. 'sir, i can’t answer that.' cruz then brought up ray epps, who was seen on video the day before the riot, telling a crowd, 'tomorrow, we need to get into the capitol! into the capitol!' the crowd responded by shouting, 'fed! fed! fed!' at him. epps, later claimed that he was not encouraging wrongdoing. 'miss sanborn, was ray epps a fed?' cruz asked. 'sir, i cannot answer that question,' sanborn replied. cruz asked more questions about epps' actions, and sanborn said she could not answer. cruz, mentioning how there are those who suspect that the fbi participated in the riot, reiterated what he asked earlier. 'did federal agents or those in service of federal agents actively encourage violent or criminal conduct on jan. 6?' cruz asked, noting that this was 'not an ordinary law enforcement question' but 'a question of public accountability.' 'not to my knowledge, sir,' sanborn said. earlier, cruz had grilled national security division assistant attorney general matthew olsenabout the number of people charged with crimes or incarcerated based on the events of jan. 6. for each question, olsen said he did not know. cruz said this claim of ignorance was in line with the justice department's unsatisfactory response to questions he and other asked last june about this and about numbers of prosecutions of people stemming from black lives matter protests.

'i have seen ryan. he has two black eyes to this day, two weeks later. all the skin is ripped off both wrists, which shows the zip ties and how tight they were,' metcalf said in a separate interview with politico.

'we had planned for possibility of violence and possibility of people being armed but not possibility of coordinated attacks,' sund told members of congress, explaining that rioters were equipped with their own radio system, planted pipe bombs, and had brought climbing gear and explosives to the capitol.

'boom, boom, boom!' that's what an insurrection looks like, but there's no charade-like miming they can't ever fully express the pain inside. we're going to deal with that in our quiet alone time, possibly wearing an upscale turtleneck. we'll let you know. but the question is, once we've had an act of war like this, how does the country respond? how do we all respond? 'boom, boom, boom!' as sandy would say. well, obviously, we need a commission, of course, and a criminal investigation. there's probably one underway, by the way and then a day of remembrance, because you can't let the memory die. so, who's going to lead this? well, the obvious candidates, liz cheney, adam schiff and speaking of crying, adam kinzinger. they're the naturals. we called them today to see what they're planning. how are we going to commemorate this latest insurrection? they haven't gotten back to us yet, probably sleeping or weeping. but we can assume from past experience that adam kinzinger feels this really deeply, really deeply. watch. yeah, adam kinzinger is right and we 've made fun of him in the past like a grown dude crying on tv. we mocked that. we apologized. adam kinzinger, we can recover. but there's only one path toward recovery and if you talk to any recovery expert, they will tell you the way to recover is to viciously punish the people who hurt your feelings—step one. it's always step one. so, we're going to have to mete out some pretty serious punishment. stephen colbert's team of insurrectionists have been jailed for one night. that's not a lot. the penalty for insurrection is death. we're not calling for that here. this is a moderate show. these are our fellow americans. we owe them a second chance. thankfully, there's recent precedent

'we can’t wait any longer,' pelosi said june 15. 'we will proceed.' many republicans have made clear that they want to move on from the jan. 6 attack, brushing aside the many unanswered questions about the insurrection, including how the government and law enforcement missed intelligence leading up to the rioting and the role of trump before and during the insurrection. some republicans have gone so far as to downplay the violence, with one suggesting the rioters looked like tourists and another insisting that a woman, ashli babbitt, who was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the house chamber through a window was 'executed.' last week, 21 republicans voted against giving medals of honor to capitol police and metropolitan police to thank them for their service that day. dozens of those officers suffered injuries, including chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones. seven people died during and after the rioting, including babbitt, three other trump supporters who died of medical emergencies and two police officers who died by suicide in the days that followed. a third officer, capitol police officer brian sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes.",2021-06-22,-0.9835,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'new', 'committee', 'comes', 'senate', 'republicans', 'blocked', 'legislation', 'form', 'bipartisan', 'independent', 'commission', 'investigate', 'attack', 'former', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'supporters', 'pelosi', 'earlier', 'month', 'house', 'step', 'investigations', 'riot', 'violent', 'mob', 'overran', 'police', 'broke', 'building', 'hunted', 'lawmakers', 'try', 'stop', 'certification', 'joe', 'biden', 'election', 'victory', 'new', 'select', 'committee', 'put', 'majority', 'democrats', 'charge', 'investigation', 'three', 'dozen', 'republicans', 'house', 'seven', 'senate', 'republicans', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'partisan', 'probe', 'supported', 'legislation', 'form', 'commission', 'modeled', 'similar', 'panel', 'investigated', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'numbers', 'strong', 'enough', 'overcome', 'gop', 'opposition', 'senate', 'support', 'republicans', 'needed', 'pass', 'bills', 'democrats', 'vote', 'yes', 'bloc', 'senate', 'democratic', 'leader', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'may', 'hold', 'second', 'vote', 'legislation', 'failed', 'advance', 'last', 'month', 'indication', 'democrats', 'win', 'necessary', 'support', 'three', 'additional', 'republicans', 'wait', 'longer', 'pelosi', 'june', 'proceed', 'many', 'republicans', 'made', 'clear', 'want', 'move', 'attack', 'brushing', 'aside', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'insurrection', 'including', 'government', 'law', 'enforcement', 'missed', 'intelligence', 'leading', 'rioting', 'role', 'trump', 'insurrection', 'republicans', 'gone', 'far', 'downplay', 'violence', 'suggesting', 'rioters', 'looked', 'like', 'tourists', 'another', 'insisting', 'woman', 'ashli', 'babbitt', 'shot', 'killed', 'day', 'trying', 'break', 'house', 'chamber', 'window', 'last', 'week', 'republicans', 'voted', 'giving', 'medals', 'honor', 'capitol', 'police', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'thank', 'service', 'day', 'dozens', 'officers', 'suffered', 'injuries', 'including', 'chemical', 'burns', 'brain', 'injuries', 'broken', 'bones', 'seven', 'people', 'died', 'rioting', 'including', 'babbitt', 'three', 'trump', 'supporters', 'died', 'medical', 'emergencies', 'police', 'officers', 'died', 'suicide', 'days', 'followed', 'third', 'officer', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'brian', 'sicknick', 'collapsed', 'later', 'died', 'engaging', 'protesters', 'medical', 'examiner', 'determined', 'died', 'natural', 'causes']"

'they could have killed us all,' fumed sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c. 'how could they(u.s. capitol police) have failed so miserably, 20 years after 9/11? they could have blown the building up.' we came damn close to losing it all on jan. 6.  over the years, i’ve learned to 'watch' things on capitol hill. observing, so as to divine meaning and decode various happenings. i frequently watch the floor directors for the speaker and majority leader in the house chamber. the floor director serves as a parliamentary sentinel for trouble. if the floor director is worked up, it’s a good bet something bad is going down.  an amendment may be about to fail. a member voted differently than was expected. there’s an unanticipated problem with a bill. they may lack the votes to pass legislation. in the house, i train my eyes on keith stern, pelosi’s floor director. i was downstairs in the capitol visitor’s center in an auxiliary studio fox news uses during the pandemic to cover the electoral college certification. one of my earpieces was jacked into fox’s new york city and washington studios. the other earpiece was wired so i could listen to either the house or senate floors. we set up two monitors so i could observe happenings in both the house and senate chambers. not long after 2 p.m. et wednesday, i reported that there was a security threat inside the capitol. i saw stern running on my monitor as the house attempted to debate arizona’s slate of electoral votes. stern’s panic spelled a problem. a couple of moments later, the house abruptly recessed. but i could still hear the house floor audio in my earpiece.  rep. jim mcgovern, d-mass., presided over the session. years ago, congressional security officials told me of a battle plan during a hypothetical terrorist threat during state of the union. they would likely cut the tv feed so officials could instruct those in the chamber on what to do. seconds later, mcgovern warned lawmakers and aides to get down under their desks. the massachusetts democrat instructed them to grab escape hoods stowed under chairs in the chamber.  i couldn’t hear the pandemonium from the house chamber unfolding three floors above me. but it wasn’t long until i was told by multiple sources there was gunfire in the capitol.  i used caution. misinformation is a lava flow during a crisis. hot. fast. and dangerous. i finally confirmed that there was gunfire in the capitol. but i wouldn’t see video of what transpired until a few hours later. a clutch of demonstrators raised hell at the glass doors atop a staircase leading to the speaker’s lobby. the speaker’s lobby is a long, ornate hallway stretching immediately behind the house chamber. the thugs kicked at the doors to the speaker’s lobby, stabbing at it with the butt end of poles festooned with trump flags. they shouted 'break it down!' and 'f--- the police!' the hooligans were getting close. if the mob broke into the speaker’s lobby, they were all but inside the house chamber. a secondary door leading to the chamber is immediately inside the lobby. security officials shoved stacks of furniture against the doors to the speaker’s lobby to prevent the invaders from breaking inside. then, a plainclothes u.s capitol police officer appeared inside the doorway to the speaker’s lobby, service weapon drawn. a woman later identified as ashli babbitt of california then allegedly tried to scale the doorway and vault over the transom of the speaker’s lobby.  holding his weapon steady, the officer fired a single shot. it killed babbitt.  in normal, pre-pandemic times, i spend hours in the speaker’s lobby. it’s where most reporters go to talk to lawmakers and aides when votes are called in the house. the speaker’s lobby hasn’t been open since march due to the pandemic. but the video from wednesday shows the mutineers were close to busting down the doors before the officer discharged his weapon.  i will return to the speaker’s lobby through those very doors when coronavirus subsides. but this grotesque episode forever alters that hallowed venue in america’s seat of government.  american history plays out under the capitol dome.  an icon to that history is situated above the main entrance to statuary hall, the old house chamber. perched immediately above the passageway to the capitol rotunda is a statue of clio, the 'muse of history.' clio stands atop a chariot, a clock doubling as a wheel. clio gazes down on the old house chamber, recording events which unfold in the capitol below.  many of the raiders who rushed the capitol passed right under clio as they traipsed between the rotunda and the house chamber, skirmishing with the capitol police.  american history plays out under the capitol dome.  they damn near lost the building. clio witnessed it all. the events of jan. 6, 2021 are now etched into clio’s tablet.  the darkest entry yet. chad pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for fox news channel (fnc). he joined the network in september 2007 and is

chances are you're probably standing at an airport waiting to get on the plane and wishing to god someone would turn the sound down on the tv set bolted to the ceiling. because it's absurd, and so is what harris said—it's ridiculous. in fact, it's so ridiculous, we're not even going to bother to deconstruct it once again or attempt to refute it. it's self-discrediting as if kamala harris could be further discredited. we're in a kind of civil war. but more specifically, we await the adl's furious statement condemning doug brinkley for trivializing genocide, which he just did. we'll let you know when we get that statement. in the meantime, doug brinkley was right about one thing. there are an awful lot of images showing what happened inside the capitol on january 6th. we don't have to guess for the most part. i want to show one of them tonight because it's frankly representative. here's the terrifying scene on the floor of the united states senate as insurrectionists swept in. there is also film of what you saw if you were watching the coverage live that day. if you're watching january 6th unfold in real-time and you were probably like most people, no matter who you voted for, kind of shocked by it. really, people swarming around the capitol? that's not good. but then you saw something pretty strange, you saw the police who were in charge of securing the perimeter, move aside the barricades and let the protesters or rioters or insurrectionists whatever you’re going to call them—a lot of people still in prison—let them in the building. so why did they do that? there's a man called ray epps, who was a longtime conservative activist. he was captured on camera at least three times, possibly more encouraging people on january 6th and the day before—january 6th eve, january 5th—encouraging protesters to storm the capitol. so there he is, scaffold commander, commanding the crowd to break the law, exhorting them forward to break the law. there was the largest manhunt in american history conducted after this day, january 6th. we're still talking about it, as noted a year later. and yet this guy is not only unidentified, no new authority seems interested in the slightest and finding out who he is and why is that?",2022-01-06,-0.971,Very Negative,"['tucker', 'carlson', 'tonight', 'host', 'examines', 'left', 'repulsive', 'rhetoric', 'covering', 'events', 'year', 'later', 'yeah', 'january', 'indelible', 'moments', 'moments', 'ca', 'forget', 'like', 'birth', 'child', 'kennedy', 'assassination', 'moon', 'landing', 'got', 'ask', 'claimed', 'democracy', 'assault', 'chances', 'probably', 'standing', 'airport', 'waiting', 'get', 'plane', 'wishing', 'god', 'someone', 'turn', 'sound', 'tv', 'set', 'bolted', 'ceiling', 'absurd', 'harris', 'ridiculous', 'fact', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'bother', 'deconstruct', 'attempt', 'refute', 'kamala', 'harris', 'discredited', 'kind', 'civil', 'war', 'specifically', 'await', 'adl', 'furious', 'statement', 'condemning', 'doug', 'brinkley', 'trivializing', 'genocide', 'get', 'statement', 'meantime', 'doug', 'brinkley', 'right', 'thing', 'awful', 'lot', 'images', 'showing', 'happened', 'inside', 'capitol', 'january', 'guess', 'part', 'want', 'show', 'tonight', 'frankly', 'representative', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'floor', 'united', 'states', 'senate', 'insurrectionists', 'swept', 'film', 'saw', 'watching', 'coverage', 'live', 'day', 'watching', 'january', 'unfold', 'probably', 'like', 'people', 'matter', 'voted', 'kind', 'shocked', 'really', 'people', 'swarming', 'around', 'capitol', 'good', 'saw', 'something', 'pretty', 'strange', 'saw', 'police', 'charge', 'securing', 'perimeter', 'move', 'aside', 'barricades', 'protesters', 'rioters', 'insurrectionists', 'whatever', 'call', 'lot', 'people', 'still', 'building', 'man', 'called', 'ray', 'epps', 'longtime', 'conservative', 'activist', 'captured', 'camera', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'possibly', 'encouraging', 'people', 'january', 'day', 'eve', 'january', 'protesters', 'storm', 'capitol', 'scaffold', 'commander', 'commanding', 'crowd', 'break', 'law', 'exhorting', 'forward', 'break', 'law', 'largest', 'manhunt', 'american', 'history', 'conducted', 'day', 'january', 'still', 'talking', 'noted', 'year', 'later', 'yet', 'guy', 'unidentified', 'new', 'authority', 'seems', 'interested', 'slightest', 'finding']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-lawmakers-insurrectionists-shouldnt-allowed-run-government,FOX,Democratic lawmakers say insurrectionists shouldn't be allowed to run for government,Lawmakers across the country are saying that insurrectionists should not be able to run for government. Many states have already proposed laws in favor of this idea.,"January 23, 2023 10:42am EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. while the bills vary in scope, their aim is similar. 'if you’ve tried to take down our government through violent means, in no way should you be part of it,' new york state sen. brad hoylman-sigal said. he is sponsoring a bill that would bar people convicted of engaging in an insurrection or rebellion against the united states from holding civil office, meaning they would not be able to serve as a judge or member of the legislature. hoylman-sigal said he introduced the bill this year because he saw more people who were involved in the riot in washington on jan. 6, 2021, running for office last year. a virginia lawmaker introduced a bill this month, on the second anniversary of the capitol riot, that would prohibit anyone convicted of a felony related to an attempted insurrection or riot from serving in positions of public trust — including those involving policymaking, law enforcement, safety, education or health. a connecticut bill would prohibit people convicted of sedition, rebellion, insurrection or a felony related to one of those acts from running for or holding public office. senate majority leader bob duff, who introduced the measure, told the associated press that he wants the legislation eventually to bar them from holding state or municipal jobs. the legislation in the states comes after the house jan. 6 committee's final report, which found donald trump criminally engaged in a conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election he lost and failed to take action to stop his supporters from attacking the capitol. the committee's recently concluded work may have provided another springboard for lawmakers to act and propose ways to hold people accountable, said victoria bassetti, a senior policy adviser at states united democracy center, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for fair elections. some republicans say the legislation is unnecessary. in new york, republican assemblyman will barclay, the minority leader, called the bill there a 'political statement,' saying it is 'more political than it is a concern about public policy.' he said existing rules already apply to people in certain positions who are convicted of crimes and that those laws 'should be sufficient.' the legislation is another example of how the capitol riot has become a political rorschach test in the country. many republicans refuse to see the attempt to violently halt the presidential certification — which was based on lies that 2020 election was stolen — as an insurrection, while a strong majority of the party continues to believe that president joe biden was not legitimately elected. even students are being taught different versions of the attack, depending on whether they live in more conservative or liberal parts of the nation. in a committee hearing, republican state sen. cris dush slammed his gavel as he ruled democratic state sen. amanda cappelletti out of order after she described the u.s. capitol on jan. 6 as 'the site of an insurrection.' 'insurrection, nobody has been charged with that,' dush said. 'there’s not been a single charge against any of those people as insurrectionists. in this committee, we are not using that term.' nearly 1,000 people have been charged in the capitol riot with federal crimes, with about half of them pleading guilty to riot-related charges and more than three dozen convicted at trial. the charges range from misdemeanors for those accused of entering the capitol illegally but not participating in violence to felony seditious conspiracy for far-right extremist group members accused of plotting to stop the transfer of presidential power. in november, two leaders of the oath keepers extremist group were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors alleged was a weekslong plot to use force to keep trump in office. leaders of the proud boys and additional members of the oath keepers are currently standing trial on the sedition charge, which carries up to 20 years behind bars. 'these are factually correct things,' she said. 'that doesn’t mean that we can’t disagree politically about policy or other things, but we can acknowledge that that happened and start to figure out how we move forward to work together to build up that public trust again.' dush remained steadfast in his view that what unfolded on jan. 6 was not an insurrection. 'if there had been some sort of plot for an insurrection, that would’ve come apart quite quickly after the government got the control back,' he said in a phone interview. there have been some earlier attempts to prevent certain officials from either running for or holding office. a new hampshire bill that would have barred anyone who participates in an insurrection or rebellion from holding office in the state died last year. also last year, groups brought lawsuits under a rarely cited section of the 14th amendment dealing with insurrection. they sought to disqualify a handful of u.s. house members from seeking reelection for events surrounding the jan. 6 riot. in new mexico, a state court in september disqualified a rural county commissioner from holding public office for engaging in the capitol insurrection. couy griffin had been previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the capitol grounds, without going inside the building. he was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. the judge permanently barred griffin, who was then an elected commissioner from otero county, from federal and local public office. 'we have to really rid ourselves of those who would take down our government,' said duff, the connecticut lawmaker. 'there’s no place for any of them to be (in) any kind of elected or appointed officer.'",2023-01-23,-0.9944,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'bills', 'vary',

'what occurred on january 6th cannot be considered under any circumstances a protest, rally of civil disobedience. this was a well-planned, coordinated insurrection at the united states capitol,' sund wrote.'the uscp does not have the manpower, the training of the capabilities to handle an armed insurrection involving thousands of individuals bent on violence and destruction at all costs. nevertheless, because of their bravery and professionalism in the face of this attack, uscp did not fail.' on jan. 3, an internal intelligence assessment showed that members of the proud boys, white supremacist groups, antifaand other extremist groups were expected to participate in the jan. 6 event and that they may be inclined to become violent, sund said. but though intelligence showed the capitol building would be the target on jan. 6, sund said the event was expected to be similar to previouslarge protestsorganized by pro-trump supporters on nov. 14 and dec. 12 in washington, d.c. at the supreme court and adjacent capitol grounds. those maga eventsinvolved thousands of people but had a limited number amount of violence, injuries to officersand arrests, sund said, adding thatat no point at either of those events did people attempt to storm the supreme court building. sund provided a timeline of his attempts to get a request for national guard support on jan. 6. he said he reiterated his urgent request for national guard support to help shore up the perimeter of the capitol in a call at 2:28 p.m.,when army lt. general walter piatt allegedly stated, 'i don’t like the visual of the national guard standing a line with the capitol in the background.' when sund said having capitol police officers relieved from other posts to respond to the capitol was not an option and thatnational guard was needed, house sergeant at arms paul irving said he would need to run the request up the chain of command at the pentagon. 'the uscp needs more unilateral authority to implement its security planning and the ability to call in national guard support when needed.steps need to be taken to ensure national guard's ability to support uscpis seamless in the future,' sund wrote. he added, 'i also wish we had better intelligence and warnings as the possibility of this type of military-style armed insurrection. the entire intelligence community seems to have missed this.' before the national guard arrived, more than 1,700 police officers from 18 nearby jurisdictions convened at the capitol. sund said he pushed for expedited delivery of helmets ordered for officers before the inauguration, and approximately 104 helmets were delivered on jan. 4 to protect officers from individuals who might be armed in the crowds expected on jan. 6. herecognizeda 'number of systems broke down' and that 'officials or officers who violated policies or directives, or even their oath, need to be held accountable.' about a month has passed since the insurrection, and heightened security measures set in place before the presidential inauguration on jan. 20 still remain, including an eight-foot, barbed wire fence that stands around the heavily fortified capitol complex.  in an appearance on 'sunday morning futures,' sen. ron johnson, who alongside sen. lindsey graham, has requested information about the insurrection from the senate sergeant of arms, said he appreciated sund for sending the letter and providing more of an insight into who knew what that day.  'i actually appreciate what the former chief of police of capitol police, steven sund, sent in the letter. and he lays out the diligence that he undertook to provide security around the capital,' johnson told fox business network's maria bartiromo. 'it seems like he took pretty reasonable precautions. he's obviously being one of the scapegoats here.' 'it's a month has gone by and we still don't know. and yet we have these eight-foot tall fences with concertina wire completely surrounding the capitol,' he continued. 'we've been told they're going to be put in place since march at least. listen, the capitol is the people's house.' johnson argued that democrats are intentionally keeping the fencing around the capitol to send a message that anyone who voted for trump can be equated to a domestic terrorist.  'it shouldn't be barricaded unless there are some real threats that i'm not aware of that they're not telling us about. i think we ought to take that fencing down and return to asnormal of a position as possible,' johnson said. 'i think the fencing is being remade, is remaining in place to send a signal, a narrative that seventy-four million americans had voted for president trump are dangerous to our democracy. they're all insurrectionists. and that's simply not the case.' danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police and more. story tips can be sent to danielle.wallace@fox.com and

https://www.foxnews.com/media/jan-6-anniversary-msnbc-douglas-brinkley-holocaust,FOX,"Jan. 6 anniversary: MSNBC invites historian to invoke the Holocaust, backs comparisons to 9/11, Pearl Harbor",Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley joined other Democrats and TV pundits with hyperbolic comparisons on the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot.,"January 6, 2022 7:54pm EST","in media news today, an msnbc reporter warns that republicans in state legislature are passing voting laws that make 'january 6 every day,’ a cnn medical guest says that companies should not treat the unvaccinated and vaccinated as equal, and a white house reporter asks jen psaki why biden hasn’t ‘focused more on scolding the unvaccinated.’ 'but we have film footage of happened on january 6th, and we have proof,' brinkley told msnbc anchor craig melvin. 'dwight eisenhower during world war ii, made sure all the holocaust camps were filmed. so we've got the film footage, so we're combating the conspiracy theorists, deniers and some, you know, trumpeteers.' 'but what my worry is what do we call this and make sure we honor this day, this dark-stained day every year. so we've got to keep saying january 6th. i think it is like december 7th pearl harbor it is like the 9/11 tragedy, and we also need to not be afraid to call the trump insurrection of january 6th because in the end, all roads to what went wrong that day lead to donald trump's ill behavior, his anti-democratic stance he took, the big lie, after the presidential election tallies came in. and joe biden had won by millions of votes,' brinkley said. the liberal tv pundit went on say jan. 6 'has to be a crusade that's every day,' citing an editorial from the new york times declaring 'every day is jan. 6.' 'it's not just about voting in the united states, but we have to make sure our elections aren't sabotaged or that there's not subversion, there's not sorts or wild-eyed gerrymandering going on behind our backs,' brinkley said. 'right now, our secretaries of states in different states are under attack, the death threats going on of public officials. so we are in a real neo-civil war, and it's a battle between democracy versus a kind of nativist authoritarianism.' brinkley went to seemingly endorse the democrat-led effort to federalize elections, noting how president biden and vice president harris are set to promote the john lewis voting rights act next week in atlanta. 'we've got to secure free and fair elections. that's the heart and soul of our democracy. that's been our great export. we are the world's oldest democracy. and we don't defend that, we're in dark, troubled times,' brinkley added. harris similarly invoked 9/11 and pearl harbor during her speech commemorating the one-year anniversary of the jan. 6 riot. 'certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who has lived through them where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault,' harris said. 'dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars but a place in our collective memory; december 7, 1941, september 11, 2001, and january 6, 2021.' joseph a. wulfsohn is a media reporter for fox news digital. story tips can be sent to joseph.wulfsohn@fox.com and on twitter: @josephwulfsohn.",2022-01-06,-0.9264,Very Negative,"['media', 'news', 'today', 'msnbc', 'reporter', 'warns', 'republicans', 'state', 'legislature', 'passing', 'voting', 'laws', 'make', 'every', 'day', 'medical', 'guest', 'says', 'companies', 'treat', 'unvaccinated', 'vaccinated', 'equal', 'white', 'house', 'reporter', 'asks', 'jen', 'psaki', 'biden', 'focused', 'scolding', 'film', 'footage', 'happened', 'january', 'proof', 'brinkley', 'msnbc', 'anchor', 'craig', 'melvin', 'eisenhower', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'made', 'sure', 'holocaust', 'camps', 'filmed', 'got', 'film', 'footage', 'combating', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'deniers', 'trumpeteers', 'worry', 'call', 'make', 'sure', 'honor', 'day', 'day', 'every', 'year', 'got', 'keep', 'saying', 'january', 'think', 'like', 'december', 'pearl', 'harbor', 'like', 'tragedy', 'need', 'afraid', 'call', 'trump', 'insurrection', 'january', 'end', 'roads', 'went', 'wrong', 'day', 'lead', 'donald', 'trump', 'ill', 'behavior', 'stance', 'took', 'big', 'lie', 'presidential', 'election', 'tallies', 'came', 'joe', 'biden', 'millions', 'votes', 'brinkley', 'liberal', 'tv', 'pundit', 'went', 'say', 'crusade', 'every', 'day', 'citing', 'editorial', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'declaring', 'day', 'jan', 'voting', 'united', 'states', 'make', 'sure', 'elections', 'sabotaged', 'subversion', 'sorts', 'gerrymandering', 'behind', 'backs', 'brinkley', 'secretaries', 'states', 'different', 'states', 'attack', 'death', 'threats', 'public', 'officials', 'real', 'war', 'battle', 'democracy', 'versus', 'kind', 'nativist', 'authoritarianism', 'brinkley', 'went', 'seemingly', 'endorse', 'effort', 'federalize', 'elections', 'noting', 'president', 'biden', 'vice', 'president', 'harris', 'set', 'promote', 'john', 'lewis', 'voting', 'rights', 'act', 'next', 'week', 'atlanta', 'got', 'secure', 'free', 'fair', 'elections', 'heart', 'soul', 'democracy', 'great', 'export', 'world', 'oldest', 'democracy', 'defend', 'dark', 'troubled', 'times', 'brinkley', 'added', 'harris', 'similarly', 'invoked', 'pearl', 'harbor', 'speech', 'commemorating', 'anniversary', 'riot', 'dates', 'echo', 'throughout', 'history', 'including', 'dates', 'instantly', 'remind', 'lived', 'democracy', 'came', 'assault', 'harris', 'occupy', 'place', 'calendars', 'place', 'collective', 'memory', 'december', 'september', 'january', 'joseph', 'wulfsohn', 'media', 'reporter', 'news', 'digital', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter', 'josephwulfsohn']"
https://www.foxnews.com/us/seattle-police-officers-capitol-riot-fired,FOX,Seattle police officers present at US Capitol on January 6 are fired,"Two off-duty Seattle police officers who trespassed onto restricted grounds and stood next to the U.S. Capitol as rioters breached the building on Jan. 6 have been fired, the police department's interim chief said Friday.","August 6, 2021 10:11pm EDT","president of the seattle police officer guild mike solan tells ‘america’s newsroom’ that the reforms put the public at risk the officers committed three violations, including that officers must adhere to laws, city policy and department policy, according to disciplinary reports for each. 'it is based on those values that i reached my decision. the two officers were found to have crossed the outdoor barriers established by the capitolpolice and were directly next to the capitol building,' diaz said in a statement posted to the seattle police news blotter. 'clear evidence places them directly next to the capitol building. itis beyond absurd to suggest that they did not knowthey were in an area where they should not be, amidst what was already a violent, criminal riot.' in the disciplinary reports, diaz wrote the officers stood in the 'midst of an attempted insurrection' and possibly downplayed their actions that day. 'a central function of a law enforcement officer is to uphold the law and keep the peace and your actions fell far short of that,' both reports said. the termination is in line with the july recommendation issued by the office of police accountability, a civilian group that acts as a review board over the seattle police department. 'in granting the police the power and responsibility to do their work, the community takes as collateral an expectation that law enforcement will at all times earn and abide by that trust.,' diaz said friday. 'this is what should be expected of policing, and it is what i demand as chief. it is also what seattle police officers expect of their colleagues, since these two officers’ actions in d.c. that day were first brought to our attention by fellow officers. ' mike solan, the president of the seattle police officers guild, told fox news the case against the officers was 'ensconced in politics.' 'i believe that the case file in and of itself has glaring holes in it,' solan said, noting the officers said they had left the area near the riot without witnessing any wrongdoing. 'i believe just after 2 p.m., that's when a lot of the criminality was occurring inside the capitol. there was really nothing occurring outside in terms of criminality or law enforcement officers being assaulted.' the officers said they stayed on grass 30 to 50 yards away from the capitol building and never saw any signs of a disturbance, according to an opa report.as of friday, the police union has not received an inquiry from the officers about possibly appealing the terminations, solan said. the pair was two of six off-duty seattle police officers who attended then-president donald trump's 'stop the steal' rally that preceded the chaos. their trip became public after caitlin everett posted a photo on facebook of her and alexander everett at the demonstration. four other officers later admitted they were also there but said they were not involved in the riot. diaz said the everetts' presence there was unacceptable: 'more than a hundred officers sustained serious injuries – some career-ending – through outright assault,'",2021-08-06,-0.9549,Very Negative,"['president', 'seattle', 'police', 'officer', 'guild', 'mike', 'solan', 'tells', 'america', 'newsroom', 'reforms', 'put', 'public', 'risk', 'officers', 'committed', 'three', 'violations', 'including', 'officers', 'must', 'adhere', 'laws', 'city', 'policy', 'department', 'policy', 'according', 'disciplinary', 'reports', 'based', 'values', 'reached', 'decision', 'officers', 'found', 'crossed', 'outdoor', 'barriers', 'established', 'capitolpolice', 'directly', 'next', 'capitol', 'building', 'diaz', 'statement', 'posted', 'seattle', 'police', 'news', 'blotter', 'evidence', 'places', 'directly', 'next', 'capitol', 'building', 'itis', 'beyond', 'absurd', 'suggest', 'knowthey', 'area', 'amidst', 'already', 'violent', 'criminal', 'riot', 'disciplinary', 'reports', 'diaz', 'wrote', 'officers', 'stood', 'attempted', 'insurrection', 'possibly', 'downplayed', 'actions', 'day', 'central', 'function', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'uphold', 'law', 'keep', 'peace', 'actions', 'fell', 'far', 'short', 'reports', 'termination', 'line', 'july', 'recommendation', 'issued', 'office', 'police', 'accountability', 'civilian', 'group', 'acts', 'review', 'board', 'seattle', 'police', 'department', 'granting', 'police', 'power', 'responsibility', 'work', 'community', 'takes', 'collateral', 'expectation', 'law', 'enforcement', 'times', 'earn', 'abide', 'diaz', 'friday', 'expected', 'policing', 'demand', 'chief', 'seattle', 'police', 'officers', 'expect', 'colleagues', 'since', 'officers', 'actions', 'day', 'brought', 'attention', 'fellow', 'mike', 'solan', 'president', 'seattle', 'police', 'officers', 'guild', 'news', 'case', 'officers', 'politics', 'believe', 'case', 'file', 'glaring', 'holes', 'solan', 'noting', 'officers', 'left', 'area', 'near', 'riot', 'without', 'witnessing', 'wrongdoing', 'believe', 'lot', 'criminality', 'occurring', 'inside', 'capitol', 'really', 'nothing', 'occurring', 'outside', 'terms', 'criminality', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'assaulted', 'officers', 'stayed', 'grass', 'yards', 'away', 'capitol', 'building', 'never', 'saw', 'signs', 'disturbance', 'according', 'opa', 'friday', 'police', 'union', 'received', 'inquiry', 'officers', 'possibly', 'appealing', 'terminations', 'solan', 'pair', 'six', 'seattle', 'police', 'officers', 'attended', 'donald', 'trump', 'steal', 'rally', 'preceded', 'chaos', 'trip', 'became', 'public', 'caitlin', 'everett', 'posted', 'photo', 'facebook', 'alexander', 'everett', 'demonstration', 'four', 'officers', 'later', 'admitted', 'involved', 'riot', 'diaz', 'everetts', 'presence', 'unacceptable', 'hundred', 'officers', 'sustained', 'serious', 'injuries', 'outright', 'assault']"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-jan-6-protesters-jailed-murderers-walk-free,FOX,Tucker Carlson: Why are Jan. 6 protesters still in jail while murderers walk free?,"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host commemorates the anniversary of the January 6 protests at the U.S. Capitol by analyzing what crimes Democrats prioritize, and what ones they don't.","April 6, 2021 11:10pm EDT","tucker examines the disproportionate punishment given to those in the capitol on jan 6 and those participating in blm protests we still don’t know who shot ashli babbitt, or why. no one will tell us. but then, when you’re fighting insurrectionists, you don’t have to explain yourself. you just hyperventilate about qanon, and then you do whatever you want. when a group of sad, disenfranchised people who have been left out of the modern economy show up at your office, you don’t have to listen to their complaints, not for a second. why would you? you thought listening to people’s complaints was democracy? no, these people threaten democracy. you can even shoot one of them, if you want, and get away with it. killing people without explaining yourself is an established part of counterinsurgency. if you don’t believe it, check out what happened in the second world war. until late last month, a man called michael sherwin worked for the administration as a prosecutor in washington. sherwin bragged that his office rounded up about 400 people who were in or near the capitol on jan.6. you may be wondering if 400 people really committed crimes that day. it depends how you define 'crime.' here's michael sherwin's definition: so now it’s clear. it wasn’t that 400 people broke actual laws. no, their crime, said the federal prosecutor, was 'thumbing their noses at the public,' meaning the democratic party. it wasn’t 'insurrection.' it was showing disrespect to joe biden and his enforcers like michael sherwin, and that can’t happen. that’s why michael sherwin decided to use 'shock and awe' — to teach them a permanent lesson about expressing their political opinions. as sherwin explained, 'the scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in fbi history but probably doj history.' and he may be right. how big and how serious is this investigation into those insurrectionists? so serious that the fbihas stopped investigating other crimes, and not minor crimes. so, in order to send a message to people with unacceptable political ideas in washington, d.c., we’re not going after people who sell fentanyl, a drug that has killed more than100,000 americans, or child pornographers. they won’t be punished. so who are these people who are being perused in lieu of tracking down fentanyl dealers and child pornographers? who’s experiencing the biden administration's'shock and awe'? 'griffith walked into the u.s. capitol building through the open doors on january 6, telling the agents he did not see any police officers as he entered the building. he then went into a nearby office where he 'interacted with some individuals' before exiting the building. however, he reentered the u.s. capitol building again a short time later, where he meandered through the hallways and took a few photos.' for that act of terrorism, anthony griffith faces seven years in prison. prosecutor michael sherwin is fine with that. at one point in his interview with '60 minutes,' sherwin was asked about bringing sedition charges against the people he arrests, the people who meandered. sure, he replied. why not? meandering is sedition, says michael sherwin. just for reference, federal prosecutors aren’t supposed to reveal themselves as partisan lunatics on television. sherwin’s comments were so grotesquely out of line that a federal judge appointed by barack obama, amit mehta, said he was considering issuing a gag order to make michael sherwin be quiet. the d.c. circuit court of appeals -- the most powerful appellate court in the country -- just ordered the doj to start distinguishing between actual criminals, and people who walked through open doors inside the capitol building. that ruling came after the doj tried to convince a judge that two defendants -- lisa eisenhart and her son, eric munchel - should face indefinite detention. neither lisa eisenhart nor her son damaged any property at the capitol or committed any violence. they just walked in to what we used to refer to as the people’s house. and yet, somehow joe biden’s doj convinced a trial judge that lisa eisenhart was a 'threat to our republic,' and that her son was a 'would-be martyr.' keep in mind, these are people whose only crime was trespassing in the capitol. we’re not endorsing that, but some perspective please. it took a ruling from the d.c. circuit court of appeals to bring some perspective. 'two individuals who did not engage in any violence and who were not involved in planning or coordinating the activities — seemingly would pose little threat,' the appellate panel wrote. yeah, seemingly. but the judges still didn't release eric munchel or lisa eisenhart. that's how much power these prosecutors have. they can keep you in prisoneven when a three-judge appellate panel concludes there's no reason for you to be in prison. that's probably why prosecutors still haven't, as of tonight, released a man called jacob chansely, otherwise known as the 'chewbacca guy.' like eric munchel and lisa eisenhart, jacob chansely isn't accused of committing any act of violence. he's not accused of breaking any property. what exactly did he do? we can answer that question. video shows him walking through the senate chamber. 'chewbacca guy' is still in jail. he’ll be there indefinitely. before you shrug that off, think about what that’s actually like. you don’t want to think about it. a number of people arrested on jan.6are still rotting in the d.c.municipal lockup, one of the foulest detention centers in the country. it's atruly repulsive, mismanaged place. ask anyone from washington, d.c. what they would do not to be thrown in the d.c. jail. it’s that bad. some say they’ve been beaten, not surprisingly, by guards there. lawyers for one, a man called ryan samsel, sayhe was beaten so badly, he has a skull fracture and is now blind in one eye. how many antifa rioters or blm vandals can say that? did they lose their eyesight from being beaten in jail? well, as a group, they didn't spend much time in jail. most were spring on bail immediately, which politicians like kamala harris helped them pay. last summer, for example, authorities released a terrorism suspect in oklahoma called eric christopher ruffin, after black lives matter posted his $750,000 bond. according to authorities, ruffin, 'encouraged others to burn an oklahoma county sheriff's van and an oklahoma city bail bonds business may 30. the van was destroyed. cj's bail bonds had $8,850 in damage from broken windows.' but eric christopher ruffin went home, and he went home for one reason: unlike the chewbacca guy, he didn't upset the people in charge. he didn't walk in their 'sacred chamber' and talk about 'liberty and rights.' he just tried to vaporize some police vehicles,and that’s exactly what our political class wanted him to do. so he’s a hero, he’s fine. he hasn’t lost his eyesight getting a beating in jail. this kind of thing, unequal treatment under the law, is on stark display across the country right now. we could spend an hour giving you examples, but here are a couple: the suspect, darlene montoya, was in jail for a serious crime -- she'd been accused of assault with a deadly weapon. but, is that really as serious as meandering through the capitol building? no, of course not, it’s not 'insurrection.' so, darlene montoya got to walk out of jail and find someone else to hurt. meanwhile, in detroit, a judge decided to release four felons who had been convicted of criminal sexual assault, and another 14 people who had committed assault. the judge claimed the coronavirus justified their release. according to prosecutors, one of those felons went out and raped three women at knifepoint. why haven’t you read this? no one covers any of this because it happens too often to notice. last month, however, one of these murders was caught on video. it was impossible to ignore. two teenage girls -- one 15, and one 13 -- carjacked and killed a pakistani immigrant driver called mohammad anwar. he has kids, and was just trying to work, trying to make a buck. as mohammad anwar lay dying on the sidewalk, one of the girls complained that the real crisis was she couldn’t find her cellphone. you kill a guy who’s just trying to work, and then you can’t even be bothered to notice as he dies on the sidewalk because you’re worried about your phone. there’s a big problem with these girls. they’re young, for sure, but they did something awful. the biggest threat to you, if you’re an autocrat, is people who mock you, and don’t take you seriously, and sneer at you. you want them in prison, and autocrats are doing just that.",2021-04-06,-0.9998,Very Negative,"['tucker', 'examines', 'disproportionate', 'punishment', 'given', 'capitol', 'jan', 'participating', 'blm', 'protests', 'still',

'they want to eliminate the capitalist system and replace it with … a socialist system. they want a centralized government, even though our constitution is set up as a federalist system to divide power to protect us. and the whole focus of the revolution, the whole focus of the declaration, is on the unalienable rights of the individual. the whole focus of biden and the democrats in the media is against the individual.' in order for the democrats to bring about this revolution, they target free speech, levin said. 'if you have a different viewpoint, you dare not mention it in the classroom today. you dare not mention it on social media. you will be censored. you will be banned. you will be destroyed. that's the nature of totalitarian regimes, not americanism.' levin didn't excuse the violence that occurred on jan. 6 and said those who were violent and attacked cops should be prosecuted, but he highlighted, what he believes, is bias in the justice system. 'so what's happened to black lives matter? what's happened to antifa? … one city after another destroyed people, killed people, [and] maimed. oh yes, yes! – but it was mostly peaceful, according to the press,' he said. 'we conservatives, we oppose violence. we believe in civil society. we believe in law and order. jan. 6 is a demonstration of what the democrats believe in. what do they believe in? they believe in power.' hannah grossman is an associate editor at fox news digital.",2022-01-09,0.8849,Very Positive,"['liberty', 'levin', 'host', 'mark', 'levin', 'reacts', 'politicization', 'reveals', 'real', 'insurrection', 'took', 'place', 'host', 'went', 'highlight', 'believed', 'democrats', 'grand', 'scheme', 'media', 'working', 'tandem', 'democrats', 'bring', 'socialist', 'revolution', 'conspire', 'individual', 'according', 'levin', 'want', 'eliminate', 'capitalist', 'system', 'replace', 'socialist', 'system', 'want', 'centralized', 'government', 'even', 'though', 'constitution', 'set', 'federalist', 'system', 'divide', 'power', 'protect', 'us', 'whole', 'focus', 'revolution', 'whole', 'focus', 'declaration', 'unalienable', 'rights', 'individual', 'whole', 'focus', 'biden', 'democrats', 'media', 'individual', 'order', 'democrats', 'bring', 'revolution', 'target', 'free', 'speech', 'levin', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'dare', 'mention', 'classroom', 'today', 'dare', 'mention', 'social', 'media', 'censored', 'banned', 'destroyed', 'nature', 'totalitarian', 'regimes', 'americanism', 'levin', 'excuse', 'violence', 'occurred', 'violent', 'attacked', 'cops', 'prosecuted', 'highlighted', 'believes', 'bias', 'justice', 'system', 'happened', 'black', 'lives', 'matter', 'happened', 'antifa', 'city', 'another', 'destroyed', 'people', 'killed', 'people', 'maimed', 'oh', 'yes', 'yes', 'mostly', 'peaceful', 'according', 'press', 'conservatives', 'oppose', 'violence', 'believe', 'civil', 'society', 'believe', 'law', 'order', 'demonstration', 'democrats', 'believe', 'believe', 'believe', 'power', 'hannah', 'grossman', 'associate', 'editor', 'news', 'digital']"

'i stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. i say that while also expressing my support as an american citizen for peaceful protest in our country. i have fully supported all peaceful protests in america. i love, respect and support all my fellow coaches, players and staff that i work with and respect their views and opinions.' rivera said del rio’s fine would be donated to the united states capitol police memorial fund. del rio’s comments had other implications. 'it is time for jack del rio to resign or be terminated,' johnson said. 'his comments could not have been more offensive and ignorant. the jan. 6th insurrection — an attempted coup — was far from a ‘dust-up.’ each day we learn more and more on just how close our democracy came to autocracy. 'downplaying the insurrection by comparing it to nationwide protests, which were in response to a public lynching, is twisted. you can’t coach a majority black team while turning your back on the black community. it’s time for you to pack up and step off the field.' commanders defensive lineman jonathan allen said he wasn’t bothered by del rio’s opinion.

'proud boys scuffled with cops and drove them inside to hide. breached the doors. one guy made it all the way to the house floor, another to pelosi’s office,' he wrote in a different missive. 'a good time.' but his messages didn’t stop there, according to authorities. 'we need to do this at the local level,' he allegedly wrote in a second message less than a minute later. 'we need to do this at the local level. lets (s.i.c) storm the capitol in ohio. tell me when!' sources told fox news he was charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the u.s. government. court papers show he was also charged with obstruction of an official proceeding; knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; and violent entry or disorderly conduct. caldwell is believed to be the first rioter hit with conspiracy charges. he could not be reached despite several attempts by fox news. among the hundreds who stormed the capitol on jan. 6 were eight to 10 people wearing 'paramilitary equipment' and clothing that identified them as members of the oath keepers, authorities said. they moved 'in an organized and practiced fashion and force[d] their way to the front of the crowd gathered around a door to the u.s. capitol,' court papers state. two of those members allegedly include jessica watkins and donovan crowl. watkins and crowl, both from ohio, are being held at a county jail in dayton, after being arrested monday. federal documents identify them as members of the ohio state regular militia, dues-paying members of the oath keepers. watkins, a 38-year-old self-described commanding officer of the ohio state regular militia, posted video and comments on jan. 6 on the parler social media site, investigators said. in one instance, she posted a picture of herself and included the caption, 'me before forcing entry into the capitol building.' watkins also reportedly posted that entry was forced through the back door of the capitol. they are amongmore than 125 peoplearrested so far on charges related to the jan. 6violent insurrection, which led to the deaths of a capitol police officer and four others. stephanie pagones is a digital reporter for fox business and fox news. story tips can be sent to stephanie.pagones@fox.com and on twitter: @steph_pagones.",2021-01-19,-0.9883,Very Negative,"['news', 'griff', 'jenkins', 'talks', 'trump', 'supporters', 'walking', 'capitol', 'protests', 'erupt', 'january', 'oath', 'keepers', 'court', 'papers', 'organized', 'collection', 'militia', 'believe', 'federal', 'government', 'coopted', 'shadowy', 'conspiracy', 'trying', 'strip', 'american', 'citizens', 'rights', 'seen', 'photographs', 'capitol', 'grounds', 'investigators', 'scoured', 'caldwell', 'facebook', 'page', 'found', 'caldwell', 'involved', 'planning', 'coordinating', 'january', 'breach', 'affidavit', 'states', 'caldwell', 'allegedly', 'made', 'arrangements', 'oath', 'keepers', 'stay', 'virginia', 'hotel', 'reportedly', 'writing', 'facebook', 'good', 'location', 'allow', 'us', 'hunt', 'night', 'wanted', 'references', 'another', 'alleged', 'oath', 'keepers', 'leader', 'potential', 'arms', 'adds', 'according', 'affidavit', 'hours', 'insurrection', 'caldwell', 'purportedly', 'wrote', 'facebook', 'message', 'storming', 'castle', 'please', 'share', 'instigator', 'boys', 'scuffled', 'cops', 'drove', 'inside', 'hide', 'breached', 'doors', 'guy', 'made', 'way', 'house', 'floor', 'another', 'pelosi', 'office', 'wrote', 'different', 'missive', 'good', 'messages', 'stop', 'according', 'authorities', 'need', 'local', 'level', 'allegedly', 'wrote', 'second', 'message', 'less', 'minute', 'later', 'need', 'local', 'level', 'lets', 'storm', 'capitol', 'ohio', 'tell', 'sources', 'news', 'charged', 'conspiracy', 'commit', 'offense', 'government', 'court', 'papers', 'show', 'charged', 'obstruction', 'official', 'proceeding', 'knowingly', 'entering', 'remaining', 'restricted', 'building', 'grounds', 'without', 'lawful', 'authority', 'violent', 'entry', 'disorderly', 'conduct', 'caldwell', 'believed', 'rioter', 'hit', 'conspiracy', 'charges', 'reached', 'despite', 'several', 'attempts', 'news', 'among', 'hundreds', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'eight', 'people', 'wearing', 'equipment', 'clothing', 'identified', 'members', 'oath', 'keepers', 'authorities', 'moved', 'organized', 'practiced', 'fashion', 'force', 'way', 'front', 'crowd', 'gathered', 'around', 'door', 'capitol', 'court', 'papers', 'state', 'members', 'allegedly', 'include', 'jessica', 'watkins', 'donovan', 'crowl', 'watkins', 'crowl', 'ohio', 'held', 'county', 'jail', 'dayton', 'arrested', 'monday', 'federal', 'documents', 'identify', 'members', 'ohio', 'state', 'regular', 'militia', 'members', 'oath', 'keepers', 'watkins', 'commanding', 'officer', 'ohio', 'state', 'regular', 'militia', 'posted', 'video', 'comments', 'parler', 'social', 'media', 'site', 'investigators', 'instance', 'posted', 'picture', 'included', 'caption', 'forcing', 'entry', 'capitol', 'building', 'watkins', 'reportedly', 'posted', 'entry', 'forced', 'back', 'door', 'capitol', 'amongmore', 'peoplearrested', 'far', 'charges', 'related', 'insurrection', 'led', 'deaths', 'capitol', 'police', 'officer', 'four', 'others', 'stephanie', 'pagones', 'digital', 'reporter', 'business', 'news', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-capitol-riot,FOX,Reporter's Notebook: Inside the US Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot,"Seeing images of smoke bombs going off in the Ohio Clock Corridor outside the Senate chamber, rioters on the floor of the Senate and clashes in the Capitol Rotunda, we suddenly heard a loud commotion. The mob was downstairs.","February 10, 2021 10:32am EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. just before 11 a.m. wednesday, i arrived at the capitol, and all was calm and peaceful. i told my uber driver to stay safe and went to work. i then went downstairs to the second floor outside the senate chamber to find republican senators to question about the results in georgia and to watch the mahogany boxes holding the electoral college certificates be paraded to the house chamber. after the boxes departed the senate, a u.s. capitol police officer i know suggested i take a lookout the west front windows. popping back upstairs, i was preparing to go into the senate chamber when fox news showed live images of the protesters breaching the west front. still, i wasn’t concerned. itwas unfathomable they would ever get remotely close to entering the building. with a few republicans planning to object to arizona’s electoral slate, i knew the senate would return to session any minute for debate. unlike the house chamber, you’re not allowed to have electronics in the senate chamber, so i gathered my pen and pad to take notes during senate majority leadermitch mcconnell'sspeech at the top. the cameras in the senate chamber are controlled by the senate recording studio. reporting from inside the chamber allows you to grab color and describe small details you wouldn’t see on tv. for instance, before the speeches began, i could overhear sen.mitt romney, r-utah, telling sen.rob portman, r-ohio, 'that’s what’s going on right now ... outside,' as romney showed portman his phone screen. i didn’t know what exactly they were talking about, but i’m sure it was the situation outside the capitol. the debate eventually began. mcconnell spoke, followed by schumer. i left midway through schumer’s speech to return to my office to type up my notes. then i get a text from the pool of hill journalists that the protesters made it inside the capitol. i thought, o.k., a small handful got inside the building. no way the capitol of the united states of america would be overrun by a violent mob. thenthe video feed from the senate floor abruptly stopped. a colleague from another network popped his head into my office asking if i saw what happened. 'no,'i replied, saying thatit just went off. a staffer was caught on a hot mic on the senate floor saying 'the protesters are in the building.' our evacuation point was supposed to be the senate chamber, but it was too late. we had to lock the doors and hunker down in our offices. soon after, a shelter-in-place announcement blared over the speakers. i was worried about one of my colleagues who was reporting from inside the house chamber. a report of a gunshot frightened all of us. thankfully, anothercoworker, kelly phares, and i knew our other colleague was o.k. because she texted us while continuing to report the news in real time that the violent mob was trying to break down the house chamber doors. thanks to heroic colleagues like her, we began to see images of what was happening inside the building. it was mind-boggling. the capitol had been overrun by insurrectionists. seeing images of smoke bombs going off in the ohio clock corridor outside the senate chamber, rioters on the floor of the senateand clashes in the capitol rotunda,we suddenlyheard a loud commotion. the mob was downstairs. i told phares and another coworker, jared halpern, to pack up everything they needed in case we needed to make a run for it. i didn’t want to scare them, but i later told them that night i had planned an escape route if we needed it.thankfully, the rioters never found us. soon after, capitol police evacuated us to an 'undisclosed location.'we were safe next door to the room where all the senators and their staff were located. but i will never forget the walk to the undisclosed location, the smell of pepper spray and tear gasoutside the chamber, and seeinggarbage and debris strewn on the floor. as we got to the capitol basement, the smell was even worse and made it difficult to breathe.at the evacuation site, scores of fbi officers were there protecting us. i felt safe again. i can’t even imagine what my journalistcolleagues in the house chamber or capitol rotunda went through. they are brave and heroic, dedicated to showing the world what went on inside the capitol. one congressional aide barricaded alone inside his capitol office described to reporters how rioters tried and failed to break down his locked door for 20 minutes. my phone constantly buzzed with worried friends asking if i was o.k. i definitely should have texted my dad back sooner, but you lose all sense of time in the moment. plus, i still had to report on the story. some senators would occasionally walk past us. i had to keep reporting. sens. dick durbin, d-ill., roy blunt, r-mo. shelley moore capito, r-w.va., rand paul, r-ky., and others,spoke to reporters. but when i tried asking sen.ted cruz, r-texas, if president trump’s rhetoric caused what happened today, he ignored me. sen.tommy tuberville, r-ala., ignored me as well. these were two of the senators leading the charge to object to electoral college certification. after about two-and-a-half hours, police escorted everyone – as well as the mahogany electoral college boxes–back to the capitol. they told us not to touch anything because pepper spray and tear gas residue blanketed the halls of congress. it covered everything:floors, railings, statues, walls, and more. there werealso broken glass, furnitureand garbage strewn about inside the capitol. the senate and house eventually returned to session, and i continued to work interviewing senators and shouting questions at vice president mike pence, whoignored them. just before 4 a.m., congress finally certified the electoral college. i caught speaker nancy pelosi leaving the house floor and asked her what she was thinking now that this day was finally over. pelosi, who looked absolutely exhausted, replied it was almost 4 a.m. and said she didn’t want to do any interviews. i didn’t blame her. we just survived an insurrection. i was exhausted, too.",2021-02-10,-0.7633,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check',

'tomorrow is going to be a tough one for those of us who were there or had loved ones in the building. thinking of all of you and finding strength knowing i’m not alone in this….#january6th' that was just a tweet. but, someday, you’ve got to believe, because this is a hopeful country, hunt and her fellow survivors of the insurrection massacre of jan. 6 will come together in some more formal way: annual reunions, held in the shadow of washington’s certain-to-be-built jan. 6 memorial, the one they’ll have to bulldoze the washington monument to construct. hunt and graying grizzled veterans of the washington post and bloomberg news, and politico, and the daily beast and the atlantic magazine will raise their white claws as one, and remember how they cheated death that terrible day. but of course, merrick garland never speaks alone. the chorus always joins him, because they always move as one. arrested for what? i guess there wasn’t room in the tweet to explain. but just arrested. bad people should be arrested, that’s the point. what’s interesting is there are a lot of actual criminals who got no space in the garland speech. garland made no mention at all of the 'pipe bomber' of jan. 5. – we’re observing the anniversary of the pipe bomber right now. that individual was caught – we would say man but we don’t want to get to specific in the current environment - on surveillance tape. he used his phone several times. that’s all traceable. where is that person? but merrick garland didn't mention it. here's what he focused on instead: what are they busy doing? well, they’re busy repeating the talking points merrick garland has prepared for them.  let’s be honest, everyone who’s conservative appreciates ted cruz. you may not like him, but you’ve got to appreciate him. he’s legitimately smart, and he’s one of the more articulate people to serve in congress, maybe the most articulate. he doesn’t use a single word by accident. every word ted cruz uses is used intentionally, he’s a lawyer.",2022-01-05,-0.8931,Very Negative,"['tucker', 'carlson', 'tonight', 'host', 'discusses', 'media', 'response', 'eve', 'anniversary', 'nation', 'wracked', 'unimaginable', 'loss', 'years', 'past', 'remember', 'casualties', 'gettysburg', 'lost', 'pearl', 'harbor', 'nearly', 'americans', 'dead', 'new', 'different', 'age', 'antiquated', 'metrics', 'work', 'observe', 'moment', 'silence', 'fallen', 'january', 'feelings', 'survivors', 'feel', 'especially', 'reporters', 'survived', 'feelings', 'reporters', 'washington', 'matter', 'great', 'deal', 'america', 'certainly', 'matter', 'lot', 'feel', 'moment', 'feel', 'probably', 'realized', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'anyone', 'cares', 'journalists', 'capitol', 'hill', 'care', 'upset', 'many', 'still', 'recovered', 'saw', 'day', 'lie', 'sleep', 'night', 'horrible', 'images', 'replay', 'loop', 'back', 'eyelids', 'deafening', 'thunder', 'cannon', 'volleys', 'smoke', 'remorseless', 'artillery', 'fire', 'blotting', 'sun', 'screams', 'mortallywounded', 'calling', 'loved', 'ones', 'echoing', 'like', 'demonic', 'soundtrack', 'walls', 'speaker', 'lobby', 'hell', 'small', 'place', 'unless', 'possibly', 'understand', 'like', 'imagine', 'tet', 'offensive', 'plus', 'fallujah', 'plus', 'night', 'thanksgiving', 'whole', 'foods', 'tell', 'enemy', 'unless', 'looked', 'saw', 'bought', 'shoes', 'walmart', 'knew', 'otherwise', 'fog', 'war', 'friends', 'kasie', 'hunt', 'day', 'hunt', 'something', 'called', 'national', 'affairs', 'analyst', 'veteran', 'siege', 'capitol', 'hunt', 'took', 'twitter', 'today', 'give', 'hope', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'tough', 'us', 'loved', 'ones', 'building', 'thinking', 'finding', 'strength', 'knowing', 'alone', 'tweet', 'someday', 'got', 'believe', 'hopeful', 'country', 'hunt', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'insurrection', 'massacre', 'come', 'together', 'formal', 'way', 'annual', 'reunions', 'held', 'shadow', 'washington', 'memorial', 'bulldoze', 'washington', 'monument', 'construct', 'hunt', 'graying', 'grizzled', 'veterans', 'washington', 'post', 'bloomberg', 'news', 'politico', 'daily', 'beast', 'atlantic', 'magazine', 'raise', 'white', 'claws', 'remember', 'cheated', 'death', 'terrible', 'day', 'course', 'merrick', 'garland', 'never', 'speaks', 'alone', 'chorus', 'always', 'joins', 'always', 'move', 'arrested', 'guess', 'room', 'tweet', 'explain', 'arrested', 'bad', 'people', 'arrested', 'point', 'interesting', 'lot', 'actual', 'criminals', 'got', 'space', 'garland', 'speech', 'garland', 'made', 'mention', 'bomber', 'observing', 'anniversary', 'pipe', 'bomber', 'right', 'individual', 'caught', 'say', 'man', 'want', 'get', 'specific', 'current', 'environment', 'surveillance', 'tape', 'used', 'phone', 'several', 'times', 'traceable', 'person', 'merrick', 'garland', 'mention', 'focused', 'instead', 'busy', 'well', 'busy', 'repeating', 'talking', 'points', 'merrick', 'garland', 'prepared', 'honest', 'everyone', 'conservative', 'appreciates', 'ted', 'cruz', 'may', 'like', 'got', 'appreciate', 'legitimately', 'smart', 'articulate', 'people', 'serve', 'congress', 'maybe', 'articulate', 'use', 'single', 'word', 'accident', 'every', 'word', 'ted', 'cruz', 'uses', 'used', 'intentionally', 'lawyer']"

https://www.foxnews.com/us/capitol-police-apologizes-congress-target-riot,FOX,"Capitol Police apologizes, admits advanced intel showed Congress was target before insurrection","U.S. Capitol Police apologized to Congress Tuesday for failing to meet its own standards to immediately secure the Capitol building ""in the face of a terrorist attack by tens of thousands of insurrectionists determined to stop the certification of Electoral College votes.""","January 26, 2021 2:28pm EST","fox news contributor jonathan turley joins 'fox report' to discuss the potential impact of possible domestic terrorism bill. pittman cited problems with manpower, delayed approval to send in national guardsmen, and radio communications issues on the day of the attack that would need to be addressed going forward. she also admittedthe department 'should have been more prepared for this attack' given intelligence it received by jan. 4 indicating that the jan. 6 event 'would not be like any of the previous protests held in 2020.' capitol police did fulfill 'its mission of protecting members and democracy ultimately prevailed,' but she said, 'insurrectionists’ actions and the department’s inability to immediately secure the u.s. capitol emboldened the insurrectionists and horrified millions of americans.' she explained that the department was already aware that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending an event in washington, d.c. on jan. 6 and that some participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event.  'we knew there was a strong potential for violence and that congress was the target,' pittman said. the events that unfolded at the u.s. capitol on jan. 6forever changed how we look at the 'people’s house,' according to pittman, who explainedthat the campus was designed to be open and welcoming to visitors, and because of this, it was difficult to fortify. it hadn’t until recently been surrounded by eight-foot global fencing. 'even before september 11, 2001, security experts, including former uscp chiefs of police, argued that more needed to be done to protect the capitol campus —although i doubt many would have thought it would be necessary to protect it against our own citizens,' she said. former chief steven sund ‒who resigned after the riot ‒had put in a request on jan. 4 for the capitol police board to declare a state of emergency and authorize a request to secure national guard support. but the board denied his request and instead encouraged sund to contact the dc national guard to determine how many guardsmen could be sent to the capitol on short notice, which he did.  sund also coordinated with d.c. metropolitan police department acting chief of police robert contee to guarantee additional support on jan. 6. days later, when the attack actually began, capitol police needed more manpower and 'received immediate assistance from the mpd, whosent 100officers within minutes of the initial breach of the outer security perimeter,' pittman said. sund 'immediately coordinated with federal agencies and law enforcement partners across the area to gain additional boots on the ground,' according to pittman’s account, and he also lobbied the board for authorization to bring in the national guard, but he was not granted authorization for over an hour.  before rioters ever neared the capitol on jan. 6,pittman said capitol police had taken steps to change its existing operational plan to require all available officers to be working that day and increase the number of civil disturbance units scheduled to work the event from four to seven, including four hard platoons equipped with less lethal munitions.  the plan also activated its swat team to extract violent demonstrators or those with weapons from the rally and to engage in counter sniper activity, andadapted a new security perimeter based on instructions it received from the house and senate sergeants at arms. acting sergeant at arms timothy p. blodgett also addressed the house appropriations committee tuesday.  there were over 1,200 sworn personnel working on site when the attack occurred, which pittman said, 'was no match for the tens of thousands of insurrectionists (many armed) attacking the capitol and refusing to comply with lawful orders.' 'in my experience, i do not believe there was any preparations that would have allowed for an open campus in which lawful protesters could exercise their first amendment right to free speech and at the same time prevented the attack on capital grounds that day,' pittman said.'however, i do believe certain challenges the department faced the day of the attack could have been overcome with additional preparation.' the department’s lockdown policy to close and seal every entrance to the capitol was not consistently followed and a union representing officers reported that communications were difficult to hear on their radios over the ruckus of the attack. that left officers without a clear line of communication operating with limited information about what was occurring and with little instruction from leadership. communications over the pa system were also not clear enough, pittman said.  danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police

'did it dawn on you that what you were doing could cause some trouble?' defense attorney joseph mcbride asked barnett. 'i was just in the moment,' barnett replied. 'i’m just kind of going with the flow at this point.' before leaving capitol grounds, barnett used a bullhorn to give a speech to the crowd, shouting, 'we took back our house, and i took nancy pelosi’s office!' according to prosecutors. videos support barnett's testimony that a crowd pushed him into the capitol as he approached an entrance, causing him to briefly fall to his knees as he crossed the threshold. 'we have no choice!' he shouted repeatedly as he entered the capitol. after police ordered him and others to leave pelosi’s office, barnett realized he had left his american flag behind. body camera video captured barnett shouting at a police officer in the rotunda for help in retrieving the flag. more than 940 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the jan.6 attack. nearly 500 of them have pleaded guilty. barnett is one of several dozen capitol riot defendants whose case has gone to trial. a grand jury indicted barnett on eight charges, including felony counts of civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding. he also faces a charge of entering and remaining in restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon — a stun gun with spikes concealed within a collapsible walking stick. barnett, 62, is a retired firefighter from gravette, arkansas. he said he regrets coming to washington for the 'stop the steal' rally where then-president donald trump addressed a crowd of supporters.

'the evidence amassed so far subjects the defendant to felonies beyond that with which he has been charged so far, including obstructing congress, interstate travel in furtherance of rioting activity, sedition, and other offenses,' prosecutors wrote in arguing for munchel to be held in custody. they continued: 'these offenses carry substantial penalties, which incentivizes flight and evading law enforcement – a thought that the defendant appears to have contemplated by virtue of avoiding his residence and workplace, terminating his facebook account, and leaving his cell phone with an associate.' prosecutors have said munchel traveled to washington with his mother, lisa eisenhart, who has also been charged in the capitol riot. the two participated in presidenttrump's fiery 'stop the steal' rally in which the then-president exhorted the crowd to 'fight like hell' and noted they would be 'peacefully' marching to the capitol. court documents allege munchel went into the senate chamber just minutes after the chamber had been evacuated. munchel 'perceived himself to be a revolutionary, in the mold of those who overthrew the british government in the american revolution,' according to court filings. he was 'dressed for combat' with 'combat boots, military fatigues, a tactical vest, gloves, and a gaiter that covered all of his face except for his eyes,' documents state. he also wore a stun gun on his hip and mounted a cellphone to his chest to record events. stephanie pagones is a digital reporter for fox business and fox news. story tips can be sent to stephanie.pagones@fox.com and on twitter: @steph_pagones.",2021-01-25,-0.9979,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'testimony', 'detention', 'hearing', 'magistrate', 'judge', 'jeffrey', 'frensley', 'middle', 'district', 'tennessee', 'determined', 'friday', 'munchel', 'flight', 'risk', 'pose', 'harm', 'public', 'howell', 'seated', 'district', 'columbia', 'stayed', 'lower', 'court', 'order', 'pending', 'review', 'federal', 'prosecutors', 'argued', 'munchel', 'offenses', 'serious', 'enough', 'detain', 'pending', 'trial', 'ensure', 'community', 'safety', 'according', 'court', 'records', 'fbi', 'search', 'munchel', 'home', 'turned', 'tactical', 'gear', 'wore', 'storming', 'capitol', 'five', 'pairs', 'plastic', 'handcuffs', 'multiple', 'weapons', 'hundreds', 'rounds', 'ammunition', 'magazine', 'munchel', 'charged', 'violent', 'entry', 'disorderly', 'conduct', 'capitol', 'grounds', 'conspiracy', 'civil', 'disorder', 'faces', 'years', 'convicted', 'court', 'papers', 'filed', 'sunday', 'prosecutors', 'information', 'lead', 'possible', 'additional', 'felonycharges', 'sedition', 'evidence', 'amassed', 'far', 'subjects', 'defendant', 'felonies', 'beyond', 'charged', 'far', 'including', 'obstructing', 'congress', 'interstate', 'travel', 'furtherance', 'rioting', 'activity', 'sedition', 'offenses', 'prosecutors', 'wrote', 'arguing', 'munchel', 'held', 'custody', 'continued', 'offenses', 'carry', 'substantial', 'penalties', 'incentivizes', 'flight', 'evading', 'law', 'enforcement', 'thought', 'defendant', 'appears', 'contemplated', 'virtue', 'avoiding', 'residence', 'workplace', 'terminating', 'facebook', 'account', 'leaving', 'cell', 'phone', 'associate', 'prosecutors', 'munchel', 'traveled', 'washington', 'mother', 'lisa', 'eisenhart', 'charged', 'capitol', 'riot', 'participated', 'presidenttrump', 'fiery', 'steal', 'rally', 'exhorted', 'crowd', 'like', 'hell', 'noted', 'marching', 'capitol', 'court', 'documents', 'allege', 'munchel', 'went', 'senate', 'chamber', 'minutes', 'chamber', 'evacuated', 'munchel', 'revolutionary', 'mold', 'overthrew', 'british', 'government', 'american', 'revolution', 'according', 'court', 'filings', 'combat', 'boots', 'military', 'fatigues', 'tactical', 'vest', 'gloves', 'gaiter', 'covered', 'face', 'except', 'eyes', 'documents', 'state', 'wore', 'stun', 'gun', 'hip', 'mounted', 'cellphone', 'chest', 'record', 'events', 'stephanie', 'pagones', 'digital', 'reporter', 'business', 'news', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter']"
https://www.foxnews.com/us/clear-the-capitol-pence-pleaded-timeline-of-riot-shows,FOX,"‘Clear the Capitol,’ Pence pleaded, timeline of riot shows",,"April 10, 2021 8:59pm EDT","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. 'we need help,' schumer, d-n.y., said in desperation, more than an hour after the senate chamber had been breached. at the pentagon, officials were discussing media reports that the mayhem was not confined to washington and that other state capitals were facing similar violence in what had the makings of a national insurrection. 'we must establish order,' said gen. mark milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, in a call with pentagon leaders. but order would not be restored for hours. these new details about the deadly riot are contained in a previously undisclosed document prepared by the pentagon for internal use that was obtained by the associated press and vetted by current and former government officials. with trump not engaged, it fell to pentagon officials, a handful of senior white house aides, the leaders of congress and the vice president holed up in a secure bunker to manage the chaos. while the timeline helps to crystalize the frantic character of the crisis, the document, along with hours of sworn testimony, provides only an incomplete picture about how the insurrection could have advanced with such swift and lethal force, interrupting the congressional certification of joe biden as president and delaying the peaceful transfer of power, the hallmark of american democracy. lawmakers, protected to this day by national guard troops, will hearfrom the inspector general of the capitol policethis coming week. 'any minute that we lost, i need to know why,' sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., chair of the senate rules and administration committee, which is investigating the siege, said last month. the timeline fills in some of those gaps. at 4:08 p.m. on jan. 6, as the rioters roamed the capitol and after they had menacingly called out for pelosi, d-calif., and yelled for pence to be hanged, the vice president was in a secure location, phoningchristopher miller, the acting defense secretary, and demanding answers. there had been a highly public rift between trump and pence, with trump furious that his vice president refused to halt the electoral college certification. interfering with that process was an act that pence considered unconstitutional. the constitution makes clear that the vice president’s role in this joint session of congress is largely ceremonial. pence's call to miller lasted only a minute. pence said the capitol was not secure and he asked military leaders for a deadline for securing the building, according to the document. by this point it had already been two hours since the mob overwhelmed capitol police unprepared for an insurrection. rioters broke into the building, seized the senate and paraded to the house. in their path, they left destruction and debris. dozens of officers were wounded, some gravely. just three days earlier, government leaders had talked about the use of the national guard. on the afternoon of jan. 3, as lawmakers were sworn in for the new session of congress, miller and milley gathered with cabinet members to discuss jan. 6. they also met with trump. in that meeting at the white house, trump approved the activation of the d.c. national guard and also told the acting defense secretary to take whatever action needed as events unfolded, according to the information obtained by the ap. the next day, jan. 4, the defense officials spoke by phone with cabinet members, including the acting attorney general, and finalized details of the guard deployment. the guard's role was limited to traffic intersections and checkpoints around the city, based in part on strict restrictions mandated by district officials. miller also authorizedarmy secretary ryan mccarthyto deploy, if needed, the d.c. guard’s emergency reaction force stationed at joint base andrews. the trump administration and the pentagon were wary of a heavy military presence, in part because of criticism officials faced for theseemingly heavy-handed national guard and law enforcementefforts to counter civil unrest in the aftermath of the police killing of george floyd in minneapolis. in particular, the d.c. guard’s use of helicopters to hover over crowds in downtown washington during those demonstrations drew widespread criticism. that unauthorized move prompted the pentagon to more closely control the d.c. guard. 'there was a lot of things that happened in the spring that the department was criticized for,'robert salesses, who is serving as the assistant defense secretary for homeland defense and global security, said at a congressional hearing last month. on the eve of trump's rally jan. 6 near the white house, the first 255 national guard troops arrived in the district, and mayor muriel bowser confirmed in a letter to the administration that no other military support was needed. by the morning of jan. 6, crowds started gathering at the ellipse before trump’s speech. according to the pentagon's plans, the acting defense secretary would only be notified if the crowd swelled beyond 20,000. before long it was clear that the crowd was far more in control of events than the troops and law enforcement there to maintain order. trump, just before noon, was giving his speech and he told supporters to march to the capitol. the crowd at the rally was at least 10,000. by 1:15 p.m., the procession was well on its way there. as protesters reached the capitol grounds, some immediately became violent, busting through weak police barriers in front of the building and beating up officers who stood in their way. at 1:49 p.m., as the violence escalated, then-capitol police chief steven sundcalledmaj. gen. william walker, commanding general of the d.c. national guard, to request assistance. sund’s voice was 'cracking with emotion,' walker later told a senate committee. walker immediately called army leaders to inform them of the request. twenty minutes later, around 2:10 p.m., the first rioters were beginning to break through the doors and windows of the senate. they then started a march through the marbled halls in search of the lawmakers who were counting the electoral votes. alarms inside the building announced a lockdown. sund frantically called walker again and asked for at least 200 guard members 'and to send more if they are available.' but even with the advance cabinet-level preparation, no help was immediately on the way. over the next 20 minutes, as senators ran to safety and the rioters broke into the chamber and rifled through their desks, army secretary mccarthy spoke with the mayor and pentagon leaders about sund’s request. on the pentagon’s third floor e ring, senior army leaders were huddled around the phone for what they described as a 'panicked' call from the d.c. guard. as the gravity of the situation became clear, mccarthy bolted from the meeting, sprinting down the hall to miller’s office and breaking into a meeting. as minutes ticked by, rioters breached additional entrances in the capitol and made their way to the house. they broke glass in doors that led to the chamber and tried to gain entry as a group of lawmakers was still trapped inside. at 2:25 p.m., mccarthy told his staff to prepare to move the emergency reaction force to the capitol. the force could be ready to move in 20 minutes. at 2:44 p.m., trump supporterashli babbitt was fatally shot by a capitol police officeras she tried to climb through a window that led to the house floor. shortly after 3 p.m., mccarthy provided 'verbal approval' of the activation of 1,100 national guard troops to support the d.c. police and the development of a plan for the troops’ deployment duties, locations and unit sizes. minutes later the guard’s emergency reaction force left joint base andrews for the d.c. armory. there, they would prepare to head to the capitol once miller, the acting defense secretary, gave final approval. meanwhile, the joint staff set up a video teleconference call that stayed open until about 10 p.m. that night, allowing staff to communicate any updates quickly to military leaders. at 3:19 p.m.,pelosi and schumer were callingthe pentagon for help and were told the national guard had been approved. but military and law enforcement leaders struggled over the next 90 minutes to execute the plan as the army and guard called all troops in from their checkpoints, issued them new gear, laid out a new plan for their mission and briefed them on their duties. the guard troops had been prepared only for traffic duties. army leaders argued that sending them into a volatile combat situation required additional instruction to keep both them and the public safe. by 3:37 p.m., the pentagon sent its own security forces to guard the homes of defense leaders. no troops had yet reached the capitol. by 3:44 p.m., the congressional leaders escalated their pleas. 'tell potus to tweet everyone should leave,' schumer implored the officials, using the acronym for the president of the united states. house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., asked about calling up active duty military. at 3:48 p.m., frustrated that the d.c. guard hadn't fully developed a plan to link up with police, the army secretary dashed from the pentagon to d.c. police headquarters to help coordinate with law enforcement. trump broke his silence at 4:17 p.m., tweeting to his followers to 'go home and go in peace.' by about 4:30 p.m., the military plan was finalized and walker had approval to send the guard to the capitol. the reports of state capitals breached in other places turned out to be bogus. at about 4:40 p.m. pelosi and schumer were again on the phone with milley and the pentagon leadership, asking miller to secure the perimeter. but the acrimony was becoming obvious. the congressional leadership on the call 'accuses the national security apparatus of knowing that protestors planned to conduct an assault on the capitol,' the timeline said. the call lasts 30 minutes. pelosi’s spokesman acknowledges there was a brief discussion of the obvious intelligence failures that led to the insurrection. it would be another hour before the first contingent of 155 guard members were at the capitol. dressed in riot gear, they began arriving at 5:20 p.m. they started moving out the rioters, but there were few, if any, arrests. by police. at 8 p.m. the capitol was declared secure. ___ associated press writers michael balsamo in new york, nomaan merchant in

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/stephen-colbert-breaks-silence-staffers-capitol-arrests,FOX,Stephen Colbert breaks silence on staffers’ Capitol arrests: 'First-degree puppetry',"Host of CBS' ""The Late Show"" Stephen Colbert spent a segment of his show Monday evening addressing the recent arrests of his crew and production members in the Longworth House Office Building.","June 21, 2022 5:04am EDT","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. the host opened the show by asking the audience about their weekends before joking, 'well, i had an interesting one and some members of my staff had a memorable one.' 'the capitol police were just doing their job, my staff was just doing their job, everyone was very professional, everyone was very calm,' the host continued. 'my staffers were detained, processed and released. a very unpleasant experience for my staff.' among those arrested was robert smigel, the puppeteer for 'triumph the insult comic dog,' a character on cbs's 'the late show with stephen colbert.' 'after they’d finished their interviews, [my staffers] were doing some last-minute puppetry and jokey make-em-ups in a hallway, when triumph and my folks were approached and detained by capitol police,' colbert said. he continued, 'a lot of paperwork for the capitol police but a fairly simple story… until the next night when a couple of the tv people started claiming that my puppet squad had quote, ‘committed insurrection’ at the u.s. capitol building.' colbert claimed his staff was not in the main capitol building, and he said he was 'shocked that he has to explain the difference, but an insurrection involves disrupting the lawful actions of congress and howling for the blood of elected leaders – all to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.' he tagged the incident as 'first-degree puppetry,' then blamed former president trump for the jan. 6 capitol riot. colbert accused journalists covering the story of looking for an excuse to talk about something other than the jan. 6 hearings and said drawing an equivalence to the rioters storming the capitol on jan. 6 is a 'shameful and grotesque insult to the memory of everyone who died.' he said it 'obscenely trivializes the service and courage the capitol police showed on that terrible day.' he joked that perhaps there was a vast conspiracy by his staffers to overthrow the government with a rubber rottweiler – a reference to the triumph the insult comic dog puppet. 'responding officers observed seven individuals, unescorted and without congressional id, in a sixth-floor hallway,' the police said in a statement. 'the building was closed to visitors, and these individuals were determined to be a part of a group that had been directed by the uscp to leave the building earlier in the day.' the capitol police said the individuals were charged with unlawful entry. 'this is an active criminal investigation, and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with the u.s. attorney,' the uscp added. earlier in the day, they conducted interviews with members of the jan. 6 select committee, including rep. adam schiff, d-calif., rep. stephanie murphy, d-fla, and rep. jake auchincloss, d-mass. rep. jim jordan, r-ohio, and rep. rodney davis, r-ill., are now asking capitol police for more information about how the group was able to gain accesses to the house building.",2022-06-21,-0.9814,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'host', 'opened', 'show', 'asking', 'audience', 'weekends', 'joking', 'interesting', 'members', 'staff', 'memorable', 'capitol', 'police', 'job', 'staff', 'job', 'everyone', 'professional', 'everyone', 'calm', 'host', 'continued', 'staffers', 'detained', 'processed', 'released', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'staff', 'among', 'arrested', 'robert', 'smigel', 'puppeteer', 'insult', 'comic', 'dog', 'character', 'cbs', 'late', 'show', 'stephen', 'colbert', 'finished', 'interviews', 'staffers', 'puppetry', 'jokey', 'hallway', 'triumph', 'folks', 'approached', 'detained', 'capitol', 'police', 'colbert', 'continued', 'lot', 'paperwork', 'capitol', 'police', 'fairly', 'simple', 'next', 'night', 'couple', 'tv', 'people', 'started', 'claiming', 'puppet', 'squad', 'quote', 'committed', 'insurrection', 'capitol', 'building', 'colbert', 'claimed', 'staff', 'main', 'capitol', 'building', 'explain', 'difference', 'insurrection', 'involves', 'disrupting', 'lawful', 'actions', 'congress', 'howling', 'blood', 'elected', 'leaders', 'prevent', 'peaceful', 'transfer', 'power', 'tagged', 'incident', 'puppetry', 'blamed', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'capitol', 'riot', 'colbert', 'accused', 'journalists', 'covering', 'story', 'looking', 'excuse', 'talk', 'something', 'hearings', 'drawing', 'equivalence', 'rioters', 'storming', 'capitol', 'grotesque', 'insult', 'memory', 'everyone', 'died', 'trivializes', 'service', 'courage', 'capitol', 'police', 'showed', 'terrible', 'day', 'joked', 'perhaps', 'vast', 'conspiracy', 'staffers', 'overthrow', 'government', 'rubber', 'rottweiler', 'reference', 'triumph', 'insult', 'comic', 'dog', 'puppet', 'officers', 'observed', 'seven', 'individuals', 'unescorted', 'without', 'congressional', 'id', 'hallway', 'police', 'statement', 'building', 'closed', 'visitors', 'individuals', 'determined', 'part', 'group', 'directed', 'uscp', 'leave', 'building', 'earlier', 'day', 'capitol', 'police', 'individuals', 'charged', 'unlawful', 'entry', 'active', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'may', 'result', 'additional', 'criminal', 'charges', 'consultation', 'attorney', 'uscp', 'added', 'earlier', 'day', 'conducted', 'interviews', 'members', 'select', 'committee', 'including', 'adam', 'schiff', 'stephanie', 'murphy', 'jake', 'auchincloss', 'jim', 'jordan', 'rodney', 'davis', 'asking', 'capitol', 'police', 'information', 'group', 'able', 'gain', 'accesses', 'house', 'building']"

'although courts have previously held that, despite this defect, the committee has the power to issue subpoenas, no court has ever examined the issue of whether this particular committee is able to comply with the deposition regulations which explicitly require certain actions to be taken by the ranking minority member.' mastriano's lawyers assert that they are not questioning the legality of the committee or its ability to issue subpoenas. rather they say that without a ranking republican member, the committee cannot guarantee witnesses being deposed a fair hearing. 'due to the secretive nature of deposition proceedings, the regulations rely upon the two-party system to create an adversarial proceeding to protect the substantive rights of witnesses in the absence of a judge or public scrutiny,' the suit reads. his lawyers are also requesting the committee pay his legal fees for the suit. earlier this year, mastriano was subpoenaed by the committee for documents and testimony relating to his efforts to have the 2020 election results in pennsylvania decertified. the republican nominee provided documents and offered to take part in a voluntary interview, but the committee insisted on a videotaped deposition. 'throughout the course of this investigation, doug mastriano has always been fully open, cooperative, and transparent with law enforcement, including the fbi,' said mastriano attorney timothy c. parlatore in a statement. 'regrettably, the committee has chosen to violate the rules of the house of representatives by demanding a compelled deposition – a move that we must challenge in court.' mastriano's attorneys say that since he is the gop nominee for governor his testimony could be deceptively edited for campaign purposes. the house select committee investigating the january 6 incident has nine members, seven democrats and two republicans. 'speaker pelosi has taken the unprecedented step of denying the minority party's picks for the select committee on jan. 6,' mccarthy said at a press conference last year when announcing republicans would boycott serving on the committee.

'it's my understanding they were offered a way back into the house office buildings by a staffer for [auchincloss],' he added, as they traveled to longworth, where republican rep. lauren boebert's office is located. davis noted the only individuals ultimately arrested by capitol police for illegally touring house buildings were smigel and those working for colbert, not those accompanying loudermilk. a house aide also pointed out the arrests came on the 50th anniversary of the infamous break-in of the democratic national committee's then-headquarters at the watergate complex on the other side of washington. in total, nine individuals, including colbert senior producer jake plunkett, reportedly were taken into custody and spent one night in jail. in response, mccarthy pulled his entire slate of appointees, and characterized both the process and the committee as a farce. later, reps. elizabeth cheney, r-wyo., and adam kinzinger, r-ill., were separately seated without mccarthy's blessing. loudermilk, the republican lawmaker under fire for giving the january 5, 2021 tour, recently rebuffed claims he was involved in or sanctioned any nefarious behavior. house january 6 committee chairman bennie thompson of mississippi countered that the behavior of the folks on loudermilk's tour 'raise[d] concerns about their activity and intent.' but, capitol police chief j. thomas manger recently wrote in a letter to davis his department 'do[es] not consider any of the activities we observed as suspicious.' loudermilk reacted on social media, writing that the 'truth will always prevail' and calling accusations about him from thompson and others 'baseless.'

(antifa and blm will burn your city down for marxism.) we storm the swamp for freedom!!! we want a forensic audit of the vote. simple. we will not go away. we will not surrender.'  in anotherfacebook

metropolitan police officers, who responded to the insurrection to assist capitol police, showed mellis, along with other identified and unidentified people, using sticks and other items as weapons to assault various police officers protecting the u.s. capitol, according to the statement of facts. the footage later reviewed by the fbi showed mellis, wearing the same straw-colored cowboy hat, conferring with another individual who is wielding a stick in front of officers, taking the stick from the individual, and following him toward the officers.  mellis can be heard saying 'knock their masks off' before the body-worn camera shows mellis’ hand -- wielding the stick -- come over the top of the first person, striking at the officers who were protecting the entryway to the capitol building, the court documents say.  another video retrieved by law enforcement of that altercation shows mellis repeatedly striking and making stabbing movements towardthe officers with the weapon in his hand. he appears to be makingcontact or attempting to strike the officers’ necks between their helmets and body armor where they are not protected. forceful strikes to the neck with or without the aid of a weapon to enhance impact is more than sufficient to cause serious physical injury or death, the court documents say. danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics,

'it is very puzzling, why these two witnesses would be treated differently than the two that the justice department is prosecuting. there is no absolute immunity. these witnesses have very relevant testimony to offer in terms of what went into the violence of january 6, the propagation of the big lie, and the idea that witnesses could simply fail to show up and when the statute requires the justice department to present those cases to the grand jury, and they don't, is deeply troubling,' schiff said. the california representative also called the doj’s decision 'a grave disappointment,' and claimed it could impede the progress of their investigation. with thursday’s hearing looming, politicians serving on the committee have reportedly been in disagreement on what reforms they want to pursue in order to prevent another similar event. some members have also pushed for 'federal legislation to oppose voter suppression tactics,' reforms to the electoral count act and increasing the criminal repercussions and lowering the standards for dereliction of duty. nikolas lanum is an associate editor for fox news digital.",2022-06-06,-0.7995,Very Negative,"['news', 'contributor', 'tammy', 'bruce', 'slams', 'committee', 'explains', 'american', 'people', 'eager', 'revisit', 'capitol', 'hill', 'riot', 'production', 'series', 'described', 'national', 'event', 'meant', 'engage', 'american', 'people', 'journalists', 'tuned', 'probe', 'capitol', 'riot', 'mob', 'donald', 'trump', 'supporters', 'stormed', 'building', 'certification', 'joe', 'biden', 'election', 'victory', 'least', 'broadcast', 'networks', 'allow', 'interruptions', 'primetime', 'programming', 'live', 'coverage', 'hearing', 'hosted', 'abc', 'david', 'muir', 'cbs', 'norah', 'donnell', 'republicans', 'expected', 'counter', 'coverage', 'already', 'booked', 'major', 'cable', 'interviews', 'news', 'goldston', 'hand', 'hearings', 'month', 'particularly', 'involved', 'efforts', 'committee', 'make', 'primetime', 'hearing', 'thursday', 'another', 'later', 'month', 'friendly', 'goldston', 'considered', 'veteran', 'documentary', 'producer', 'previously', 'run', 'morning', 'america', 'committee', 'criticized', 'partisan', 'exercise', 'exemplified', 'presence', 'russiagate', 'proponent', 'adam', 'schiff', 'reported', 'calls', 'members', 'recommend', 'abolishing', 'electoral', 'college', 'puzzling', 'witnesses', 'treated', 'differently', 'justice', 'department', 'prosecuting', 'absolute', 'immunity', 'witnesses', 'relevant', 'testimony', 'offer', 'terms', 'went', 'violence', 'january', 'propagation', 'big', 'lie', 'idea', 'witnesses', 'simply', 'fail', 'show', 'statute', 'requires', 'justice', 'department', 'present', 'cases', 'grand', 'jury', 'deeply', 'troubling', 'schiff', 'california', 'representative', 'called', 'doj', 'decision', 'grave', 'disappointment', 'claimed', 'impede', 'progress', 'investigation', 'thursday', 'hearing', 'looming', 'politicians', 'serving', 'committee', 'reportedly', 'disagreement', 'reforms', 'want', 'pursue', 'order', 'prevent', 'another', 'similar', 'event', 'members', 'pushed', 'legislation', 'oppose', 'voter', 'suppression', 'tactics', 'reforms', 'electoral', 'count', 'act', 'increasing', 'criminal', 'repercussions', 'lowering', 'standards', 'dereliction', 'duty', 'nikolas', 'lanum', 'associate', 'editor', 'news', 'digital']"

'just as you heard him say on jan. 6 of last year, i would expect that president biden will lay out the significance of what happened at the capitol, and the singular responsibility president trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw,' psaki told reporters on wednesday in previewing the president's remarks. 'he will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president – in an attempt to mislead the american people, and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened – so, he will, of course, speak to the moment, to the importance in history of the peaceful transfer of power, and of what we need to do to protect our own democracy and be forward-looking,' she continued. psaki doubled down, though, in that biden will 'reflect on the role his predecessor had.' 'president biden has, of course, spoken repeatedly about how the former president abused his office, undermined the constitution and ignored his oath to the american people in an effort to amass more power for himself and his allies,' psaki said. 'he sees jan. 6 as a tragic culmination of what those four years under president trump did to our country.' days after the riot, the house of representatives introduced an article of impeachment against trump saying he 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the government of the united states.' the article alleged that before jan. 6, the joint session of congress to certify the presidential election results, trump 'repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the american people or certified by state or federal officials.' the article claimed that before the jan. 6 joint session of congress, the president addressed a crowd and reiterated 'false claims,' claiming that his remarks 'encouraged--and forseeably resulted in--lawless action at the capitol.' the house of representatives voted on jan. 13, 2021, to impeach trump. the senate, in february 2021, voted in favor of his acquittal. trump was the first president in u.s. history to be impeached twice, and the first president out of office to go through an impeachment proceeding. meanwhile, psaki, on wednesday, previewed that biden will also 'speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril opposed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance.' biden is also expected to speak to 'the work we still need to do to secure and strengthen our democracy and our institutions to reject the hated and lies we saw on jan. 6, and to unit our country,' psaki said. psaki added that the president has been 'clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy, and how the former president constantly works to undermine basic american values and the rule of law.' biden and vice president kamala harris are set to visit the u.s. capitol thursday for the anniversary of the attack, where they both are set to deliver remarks. thursday marks the one-year anniversary of the deadly riot, which saw thousands of trump supporters breach the entrance and flood into the building while congress was certifying the 2020 presidential election results in favor of biden. ashli babbitt, a 35-year-old air force veteran was fatally shot by a capitol police officer while attempting to force her way into

'i would like to see the justice department investigate any credible allegation of criminal activity on the part of donald trump,' said rep. adam schiff, d-calif., a committee member who also leads the house intelligence committee. 'there are certain actions, parts of these different lines of effort to overturn the election that i don’t see evidence the justice department is investigating.' additional evidence is set to be released in hearings this week that will demonstrate how trump and some of his advisers engaged in a 'massive effort' to spread misinformation, pressured the justice department to embrace his false claims, and urged then-vice president mike pence to reject state electors and block the vote certification on jan. 6, 2021. monday's witness list includes bjay pak, the top federal prosecutor in atlanta who left his position on jan 4, 2021, a day after an audio recording was made public in which trump called him a 'never-trumper,' and chris stirewalt, the former political editor for fox news. the committee members on sunday also reiterated they would present clear evidence that 'multiple' gop lawmakers, including rep. scott perry, r-pa., had sought a pardon from trump, which would protect him from prosecution. perry on friday denied he ever did so, calling the assertion an 'absolute, shameless, and soulless lie.' 'we’re not going to make accusations or say things without proof or evidence backing it,' said rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill. lawmakers indicated that perhaps their most important audience member over the course of the hearings may be attorney general merrick garland, who must decide whether his department can and should prosecute trump. they left no doubt as to their own view whether the evidence is sufficient to proceed. rep. jamie raskin, d-md., said he doesn’t intend to 'browbeat' garland but noted the committee has already laid out in legal pleadings criminal statutes they believe trump violated. 'i think that he knows, his staff knows, the u.s. attorneys know, what’s at stake here,' raskin said. 'they know the importance of it, but i think they are rightfully paying close attention to precedent in history as well, as the facts of this case.' garland has not specified how he might proceed, which would be unprecedented and may be complicated in a political election season in which trump has openly flirted with the idea of running for president again. no president or ex-president has ever been indicted. richard nixon resigned from office in 1974 as he faced an impeachment and a likely grand jury indictment on charges of bribery, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. president gerald ford later pardoned his predecessor before any criminal charges related to watergate could be filed.

'i will say that we learned a lot about… breakdown of processes, procedures, policies, personnel changes leading up to jan. 6, with leadership changes that led to issues or problems.' banks said 'intelligence gathering and dissemination' was a major problem before the attack, adding 'it's clear the jan. 6 committee is not interested in that.' 'we will make recommendations to speaker of the house-to-be kevin mccarthy,' banks added. 'we want to give him some ideas, some things to think about as he prepares to take on that role. i guarantee you, with our help, kevin mccarthy is going to take his responsibility as speaker of the house and overseeing capitol security, the capitol police, a lot more seriously than nancy pelosi ever did.' the congressman said he's working on the report primarily in conjunction with members who, like him, were initially appointed to the jan. 6 committee by house minority leader mccarthy, r-calif, but were blocked from sitting on it by house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif. the other members were reps. jim jordan, r-ohio, troy nehls, r-texas, kelly armstrong, r-n.d., and rodney davis, r-ill. mccarthy is also closely involved in shaping the report, banks said. in a call with reporters tuesday, banks said the release of the report is weeks away. as banks focuses on capitol security, other top republicans are pushing slightly different points in their counter-programming to the jan. 6 committee hearings. house gop conference chair elise stefanik, r-n.y., is highlighting inflation, the baby formula shortage and more as she argues democrats are focusing on the wrong things. 'democrats are scrambling to change the headlines,' she said tuesday. jordan is attacking the legitimacy and alleged liberal bias of the committee.

'i am working closely with president trump, leader kevin mccarthy, jim jordan, and my colleaguesto help lead house republicans in pushing back against lame-duck speaker pelosi's shampolitical witch-hunt,' stefanik told fox news. meanwhile, the committee hearings set to be chaired by rep. bennie thompson, d-miss., will get expansive primetime coverage. that will include live coverage of the hearing on fox business and a two-hour reaction special on fox news channel anchored by chief legal correspondent shannon bream. committee members are expected make a case about why former president donald trump and his allies are responsible for the attack on the capitol by a mob of trump's supporters. they will likely highlight trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, which he made over the course of months after the election. trump then repeated those false claims at a rally in washington, d.c., on the morning of the attack, shortly before congress was set to meet to count electoral votes. asked his thoughts on democrats' case for why trump is at fault for the attack, banks emphasized apparent security breakdowns that allowed the mob of trump supporters to break into the capitol, sending hundreds of lawmakers into hiding. 'we should study the events that led up to it. why the capitol was left unsecured on jan. 6 when there was intelligence dating back before jan. 6 something was going to happen,' banks said.

'he went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. and we can’t let that ever happen again,' she said.  haley acknowledged that trump's base still remains loyal to the former presidentbut said that going forward,'i think what we need to do is take the good that he built, leave the bad that he did, and get back to a place where we can be a good, valuable, effective party. but at the same time, it’s bigger than the party. i hope our country can come together and figure out how we pull this back.' haley’s praise and criticism of trump underscores her apparent strategy of showcasing the achievements of the trump administration while criticizing trump’s efforts to upend his presidential election defeat to now-president joe biden and his encouragement of those who stormed the capitol. a republican strategist in the former ambassador and governor's orbit tells fox news that 'haley realizes that the liberal media blows up any and all republican criticism of president trump, attempting to push a gop civil war. she’s not going to play that game.'

https://www.foxnews.com/us/capitol-riot-qanon-shaman-jailhouse-interview,FOX,Capitol rioter 'QAnon Shaman' claims in new interview that officers 'waved' him into building on Jan. 6,"The self-described ""QAnon Shaman"" claimed in a jailhouse interview aired Thursday that police officers waved him and others into the building on that day two months ago.  ","March 4, 2021 10:03am EST","independent journalist glenn greenwald joins laura ingraham to discuss rising concern over fbi's tracking of americans prosecutors arguedin a new filing on monday that chansley is a danger to the community, explaining he held a speared weapon as he confronted officers inside the capitol, wrote a threatening note to then-vice president mike penceand spoke about ridding the government of traitors. but chansley categorized his actions on jan. 6 differently, rejecting the notion thatwhat he did was an attack on this country. he also claimed he remained peaceful after officers 'waved' him into the capitol building. 'my actions were not an attack on this country. that is incorrect. that is inaccurate entirely,' he told '60 minutes plus' correspondent laurie segall, describing instead how he prayed, sang songs inside the building and prevented theft and vandalism. 'i sang a song and that’s a part of shamanism. it’s about creating positive vibrations in a sacred chamber,' chansley said. 'i also stopped people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the senate. i actually stopped someone from stealing muffins out of the break room. i also said a prayer in that sacred chamber because it was my intention to bring divinity, to bring god back into the senate.' segall pressed him, pointing out that he was not legally allowed to be in that chamber. 'that is the one very serious regret that i have, was believing that when we were waved in by police officers that it was acceptable,' he said, describing himself as a lover of this country and a believer in the constitution, the 'truth and our founding principles' andgod. chansley also made a distinction that although he regrets entering the capitol, he does not regret supporting former president donald trump --but he was disappointed not to have received a presidential pardon during trump's last days in office. 'i developed a lot of sympathy for donald trump because it seemed like the media was picking on him,'chansley said.'it seemed like the establishment was going after him unnecessarily or unfairly and i had been a victim of that all of my life whether it be at school or at home, so in many ways i identified with many of the negative things he was going through.' 'i honestly believed and still believe that he cares about the constitution,' chansley continued, referring to trump.'that he cares about the american people. and that’s also why it wounded me so deeply and disappointed me so greatly that i and others did not get a pardon.' 'i regret entering that building. i regret entering that building with every fiber of my being,' he added.  'but you don’t regret the loyalty to donald trump?' segall asked. chansley responded flatly,'no.' authorities have saidchansley was allegedly among the first people to force their way into the capitol building on jan. 6, disobeyed orders to leave, refused an officer’s request to use chansley’s bullhorn to tell rioters to leave the senate chamber, called pence a traitor and wrote a note to the then-vice president saying, 'it’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.' while prosecutors say the spear attached to a flagpole carried by chansley into the capitol was allegedly a weapon, his attorney has characterized the spear as an ornament.the defense lawyer also argued the message that chansley penned to pence wasn’t intended to be threatening and said his client is suffering from digestive tract difficulties, even though he has been given organic food, as he had requested. chansley, who calls himself the 'qanon shaman' and has long been a fixture at trump rallies, unsuccessfully sought a pardon from trump. in february, he issued an apology, saying he was wrong for entering the capitol building on jan. 6.  he has pleaded not guilty to two felony and four misdemeanor charges. chansley also made headlines after a judge approved a request that he be given organic food in jail to honor his religious beliefs. he is being held in washington, d.c., after he was moved from an arizona jail following his initial arrest. danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police and more. story tips can be sent to

'his decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the us and around the world,' zuckerberg wrote. 'we removed these statements yesterday because we judged that their effect -- and likely their intent -- would be to provoke further violence.' zuckerberg added that the 'priority for the whole country must now be to ensure that the remaining 13 days and the days after inauguration pass peacefully and in accordance with established democratic norms.' 'over the last several years, we have allowed president trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies,' he continued. 'we did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech.' he added: 'but the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.' facebook first flagged the video, and then removed it altogether, before locking the president’s account due to 'two policy violations.' trump lost the ability to post on facebook during the 'feature block.' in the president's video,addressing supporters, he said: 'i know your pain, i know your hurt.' 'we had an election that was stolen from us,' trump said in the video taped from the white house. 'it was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.' he added: 'but you have to go home now. we have to have peace, we have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. we don’t want anyone hurt.' the president went on to say that it is a 'very tough period of time — there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us — from me, from you, from our country.' 'this was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people,' trump said. 'we have to have peace.' trump added: 'so go home, we love you, you're very special, you’ve seen what happens, you’ve seen the way others are treated that are so bad, so evil. i know how you feel.'

'twitter's bad news,' trump said. 'they're all bad news. if you want to go through social media, big tech, if you're a republican or have a big voice, they shadow ban you.' he added: 'and it should be illegal.' the president also said he has 'been telling these republicans to get rid of section 230.' republicans have questioned whether social media giantsshould still be afforded liability protections under section 230—a rule that shields social media companies from being held liable for content on their platforms, while allowing them to moderate that content. brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",2021-01-07,-0.9911,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'zuckerberg', 'statement', 'came', 'facebook', 'initially', 'news', 'trump', 'regain', 'access', 'facebook', 'thursday', 'night', 'temporarily', 'suspended', 'due', 'policy', 'violations', 'facebook', 'suspended', 'president', 'account', 'wednesday', 'night', 'posting', 'video', 'telling', 'protesters', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'building', 'erupting', 'violent', 'protests', 'led', 'multiple', 'deaths', 'home', 'maintaining', 'presidential', 'election', 'zuckerberg', 'statement', 'hours', 'clearly', 'demonstrate', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'intends', 'use', 'remaining', 'office', 'undermine', 'peaceful', 'lawful', 'transition', 'power', 'elected', 'successor', 'joe', 'biden', 'decision', 'use', 'platform', 'condone', 'rather', 'condemn', 'actions', 'supporters', 'capitol', 'building', 'rightly', 'disturbed', 'people', 'us', 'around', 'world', 'zuckerberg', 'wrote', 'removed', 'statements', 'yesterday', 'judged', 'effect', 'likely', 'intent', 'provoke', 'violence', 'zuckerberg', 'added', 'whole', 'country', 'must', 'ensure', 'remaining', 'days', 'days', 'inauguration', 'pass', 'peacefully', 'accordance', 'established', 'democratic', 'norms', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'allowed', 'president', 'trump', 'use', 'platform', 'consistent', 'rules', 'times', 'removing', 'content', 'labeling', 'posts', 'violate', 'policies', 'continued', 'believe', 'public', 'right', 'broadest', 'possible', 'access', 'political', 'speech', 'even', 'controversial', 'speech', 'added', 'current', 'context', 'fundamentally', 'different', 'involving', 'use', 'platform', 'incite', 'violent', 'insurrection', 'democratically', 'elected', 'government', 'facebook', 'flagged', 'video', 'removed', 'altogether', 'locking', 'president', 'account', 'due', 'policy', 'violations', 'trump', 'lost', 'ability', 'post', 'facebook', 'block', 'president', 'video', 'addressing', 'supporters', 'pain', 'hurt', 'election', 'stolen', 'us', 'trump', 'video', 'taped', 'white', 'house', 'landslide', 'election', 'everyone', 'knows', 'especially', 'side', 'added', 'go', 'home', 'peace', 'law', 'order', 'respect', 'great', 'people', 'law', 'order', 'want', 'anyone', 'hurt', 'president', 'went', 'say', 'tough', 'period', 'never', 'like', 'thing', 'happened', 'away', 'us', 'country', 'fraudulent', 'election', 'play', 'hands', 'people', 'trump', 'peace', 'trump', 'added', 'go', 'home', 'love', 'special', 'seen', 'happens', 'seen', 'way', 'others', 'treated', 'bad', 'evil', 'feel', 'go', 'home', 'go', 'home', 'peace', 'facebook', 'vice', 'president', 'guy', 'rosen', 'upon', 'video', 'initially', 'emergency', 'situation', 'taking', 'appropriate', 'emergency', 'measures', 'including', 'removing', 'president', 'trump', 'removed', 'balance', 'believe', 'contributes', 'rather', 'diminishes', 'risk', 'ongoing', 'violence', 'facebook', 'initially', 'flagged', 'trump', 'post', 'label', 'saying', 'biden', 'elected', 'president', 'results', 'certified', 'states', 'us', 'laws', 'procedures', 'established', 'institutions', 'ensure', 'peaceful', 'transfer', 'power', 'election', 'company', 'later', 'removed', 'post', 'altogether', 'twitter', 'removed', 'video', 'locked', 'president', 'account', 'went', 'step', 'warning', 'violations', 'rules', 'result', 'suspension', 'platform', 'instagram', 'locked', 'president', 'account', 'wednesday', 'night', 'according', 'twitter', 'message', 'adam', 'mosseri', 'head', 'instagram', 'earlier', 'day', 'unrest', 'capitol', 'began', 'president', 'addressed', 'supporters', 'railed', 'big', 'tech', 'social', 'media', 'bad', 'news', 'trump', 'bad', 'news', 'want', 'go', 'social', 'media', 'big', 'tech', 'republican', 'big', 'voice', 'shadow', 'ban', 'added', 'illegal', 'president', 'telling', 'republicans', 'get', 'rid', 'section', 'republicans', 'questioned', 'whether', 'social', 'media', 'giantsshould', 'still', 'afforded', 'liability', 'protections', 'section', 'rule', 'shields', 'social', 'media', 'companies', 'held', 'liable', 'content', 'platforms', 'allowing', 'moderate', 'content', 'brooke', 'singman', 'news', 'digital', 'politics', 'reporter', 'reach', 'brookesingman', 'twitter']"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/capitol-riot-aftermath-trump-doug-schoen,FOX,Doug Schoen: Capitol riot incited by Trump shows democracy at risk — Dems & GOP must work together peacefully,"The unprecedented, shocking and disgraceful violent attack on the U.S. Capitol Wednesday as lawmakers met to certify Electoral College votes shows that the foundation of America’s democracy is at risk.","January 7, 2021 8:25pm EST","fox news correspondent david spunt joins 'special report' with more from the justice department. four people died as rioters swarmed the capitol — a woman shot by capitol police and three people who died as a result of medical emergencies, authorities said. trump finally took the important step early thursday of acknowledging in a statement tweeted out by an aide that there will be an 'orderly transition' of power. but we have to view this statement in the context of the president’s encouragement of the riots wednesday, when he urged his protesting supporters — who had come to washington at his request — to march on the capitol to demand that he be declared the winner of the november election. and the president at long last released a video message thursday night in which he said on camera for the first time that he will be leaving office jan. 20.  'congress has certified the results. a new administration will be inaugurated on jan. 20th,' trump said.'my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. this moment calls for healing and reconciliation.' the president added that he was 'outraged' by individuals who participated in the violent attack on the capitol and said those who broke the law 'will pay.' these comments are of course greatly welcome and substantially ease the crisis created by the attack on the capitol. but it is still hard to forget that the president took a very different stance just a day earlier. fortunately, vice president mike pence is honoring and supporting the democratic process and our constitution. on wednesday he rejected trump’s calls to refuse to accept the electoral votes of several states that voted for biden in november. once congress finally accepted all the electoral votes thursday morning, turning back challenges from some republicans, trump ran out of options to challenge his election loss. even sen. josh hawley, r-mo. — who sought to keep trump in the white house by rejecting some biden electors, and whose position i couldn’t disagree with more — decried the violent attack on the capitol. hawley said the place to resolve issues with our electoral process is first in the courts and then in congress — but never with violence. to that end, some have likened the wednesday rioting to what we witnessed this summer in major cities across the country, when racial justice protests in the streets turned violent. buildings and cars were set on fire, stores were looted, and law enforcement officers were attacked when the protests got out of control and embraced criminal activity. at the time, many democrats were more interested in explaining the violence by discussing america’s long history of systemic racism and advocating for defunding the police than they were in decrying lawbreaking and supporting lawful government and policing. to be clear, i do not see equivalence here. but i do understand the concerns of those on the right who believe that those on the left have, when it has suited them, been willing to put our democratic values and public safety at risk for political purposes. indeed, the right is not wrong to say that the left has acted in anti-systemic ways in the past. but the attack on the capitol — the first since british troops attacked during the war of 1812 — was certainly more serious because it was armed insurrection. this was an attempted coup to keep trump in power despite his election loss. and disgracefully, the president initially incited and applauded those who marched on the capitol before pulling back and telling them in a video he tweeted out to be peaceful. but that call for peaceful protest did not come until after rioters successfully stormed the capitol. without question, the rioting and violence in our cities and in the capitol were both wrong. but the lawless mob that invaded our capitol put our democracy in jeopardy. being so close and so partisan, the results of the u.s. senate runoff elections in georgia that were held tuesday clearly fed into the passions and suspicions of trump voters. democrats jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock won those two races, giving democrats a razor-thin majority in the senate. as a result of the georgia elections, democrats and republicans now each hold 50 seats in the 100-member senate, enabling incoming vice president kamala harris to cast the tie-breaking vote to give democrats control. democrats retained their majority in the house of representatives in the november election, although their majority is now slimmer. once biden and harris are inaugurated as president and vice president jan. 20, they and democrats in both houses of congress will have a responsibility to govern in a moderate way. they will need to reach out to soon-to-be senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., to make it clear that our country is deeply divided and has to be brought together by both parties. this means all sides must make it clear that they will not tolerate extreme behavior on the left or the right. biden rightfully decried the violence at the capitol wednesday and called for a de-escalation of violence for the 'work of democracy to go forward.' on thursday biden denounced those who attacked the capitol as 'a riotous mob' and 'domestic terrorists.' importantly, with democrats set to control the presidency and both chambers of congress, they must not allow the radical left to encourage or condone violent protests and should reject calls to defund the police. the larger challenge now is to move beyond this moment in our nation’s history and get our country back, because we are at risk from threats we face at home and abroad. in order to confront threats from our adversaries, the u.s. needs to show that we stand for democracy. sadly, as rioters overran the capitol on wednesday, it looked as if america stands for nothing. ultimately, the attack on the capitol was deeply upsetting moment for our country. all patriotic americans should rightfully be profoundly troubled by what transpired. but right now, it is of the utmost importance that lawmakers from both parties commit to peaceful resolution of our differences and to a bipartisan approach to ending the coronavirus pandemic with mass vaccinations, additional economic stimulus and economic recovery, improved health care, and ultimately national reconciliation and revitalizing our sense of purpose. nothing is more important. douglas e. schoen has more than 40 years of experience as a pollster and political consultant. he served as adviser to president bill

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schumer-remove-trump-capitol-riot-25th-amendment-impeachment,FOX,Schumer: Use 25th Amendment or impeachment to remove Trump after Capitol riot,"Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday said Vice President Pence should ""immediately"" invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Trump from office, while warning that if he refuses, Congress should ""impeach the president.""","January 7, 2021 12:11pm EST","fox news contributor jonathan turley tells 'fox &amp; friends' invoking the 25th amendment could easily be abused. 'the quickest and most effective way – it can be done today – to remove this president from office would be for the vice president to immediately invoke the 25th amendment,' schumer continued. 'if the vice president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, congress should reconvene to impeach the president.' schumer’s statement comes after a number of congressional democrats on wednesday urged pence to invoke the 25th amendment. the 25th amendment includes a section allowing the vice president and a majority of cabinet members to declare a president 'unable' to perform the job. a trump administration official told fox news on thursday that pence has not been involved in any 25th amendment conversations. another source who has been in direct contact with several cabinet members told fox news that there has been no discussion. meanwhile, rep. ilhan omar, d-minn., said she was 'drawing up articles of impeachment.' 'donald j. trump should be impeached by the house of representatives & removed from office by the united states senate,' she tweeted. 'we can’t allow him to remain in office, it’s a matter of preserving our republic and we need to fulfill our oath.' the calls for trump’s removal come after the president spoke at a rally wednesday, telling supporters that he would 'never concede,' and repeated unsubstantiated claims that the election was 'stolen' from him and that he won in a 'landslide.' during his remarks, he renewed pressure on pence, claiming that he should decertify the results of the presidential election and send it 'back to the states,' claiming that if he did that, trump would be president for another four years. trump’s remarks came ahead of a joint session of congress to certify the results of the presidential election. as members of the house and senate raised objections to certain electoral votes, both chambers called for a recess and left their chambers as pro-trump protesters breached the capitol building. washington, d.c., police said the security breach at the capitol resulted in four deaths –including a woman who had been shot inside the building –and at least 70 arrests. congress later returned and certified the electoral college vote early thursday, formally giving joe biden his presidential victory. white house deputy chief of staff dan scavino posted a statement from the president on twitter early thursday morning, saying: 'even though i totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on january 20th.' 'i have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,'trump said.

'that is a major blow to him. that is how he’s been able to get his base on the same page with what he wants them to do and without that, it’s going to be very tough for him.' the move by twitter capped a week tumultuous week for the president --and the nation. the president,at a rally near the white house that he headlined earlier wednesday,had encouraged supporters to march to the capitol and show strength in opposing the certification of an election that he had repeatedly claimedhe had wonand that had been stolen. two of trump’s cabinet secretaries andsome top white house staffersresigned in protest of the president’s actions. and a growing number of high-ranking gop lawmakers and other elected officials blasted the president for seemingly sparking the storming of the capitol. trump is facing plenty of blame by some in the party for the gop losses in georgia, due to his repeated claims that his narrow defeat in the state to biden was due to fraud, and for his numerous vocal attacks on georgia’s republican governor and secretary of state for refusing to aid his attempts to upend the state’s election results. trump’s 'horrific' week comes as the soon-to-be-former president has vowed to remain extremely influential in republican party politics after he leaves the white house. and it comes as he’s pledged to support primary challenges in the 2022 midterm elections against republican governors and senators who refused to aid his multiple unsuccessful efforts to upend his presidential election defeat and stay in power. but trump’s formidable clout in a party he reshaped and owned the past four years has clearly taken a hit. longtime republican consultant david carney, a veteran of numerous gop presidential campaigns over the course ofthree decades, said the past few days have been 'a horrific disaster' for trump. reacting to the move by twitter, the president said in a statement on friday night that 'i predicted this would happen. we have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. we will not be silenced!' but it wasn't only twitter: trump’s facebook and instagram accounts are also suspended, at least through the end of his presidency, and possibly longer. carney, a top political adviser to texas gov. greg abbott, said the potential long-termlockout from his social media platforms would 'be a huge crushing blow to his prospects to being a kingmaker in the future because those are his go-to platforms… it will be difficult to be much of an influencer without those platforms.' the president, at wednesday’s rally near the white house, called gop lawmakers and officials who opposed his push to upend the presidential election 'weak republicans.' and he told his supporters that 'we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. you primary them. we're going tolet you know who they are. i can already tell you, frankly.' the comments by trump contained some of his most explosive language to date against fellow party membersand could potentially have major implications in the next midterm elections, when the republicans will try to recapture both houses of congress and expand their control of the governorships. top trump political adviser corey lewandowski highlighted at the beginning of the week that 'the president has raised northwards of a quarter of a billion dollars since election day for his campaign and that will give him theopportunity to target individuals who don’t support the make america great again agenda in 2022, and that includes republicans.' 'you’ve got someone whois unbelievably popular, who has enormous amounts of cash on hand, and has the opportunity and desire to weigh in and hold people accountable for both their statements and their records,'lewandowski told fox news. trump's hopes to play a kingmaker role in 2022 come as he's also flirting with a 2024 presidential bid to try and reclaim the white house. but longtime republican fundraiser and lobbyist david tamasi emphasized that, for trump, 'the line was crossed... forever.' tamasi, who raised money for trump in 2016 and 2020, told fox news that 'politically there might be a path forward for him to try and rally certain primary challenges in certain red states, either in the house or the senate. that’s his business.' but he stressed that 'you’re not going to see any financial support from washington or from the business community or any republican who is not associated with the fringe.' dan eberhart, a major gop donor and bundler who also helped raise money for the president, told fox news that 'the desecration of the capitol is not going to be forgotten.'  he also charged that trump’s rhetoric in the georgia runoff elections 'cost senate majority leader [mitch]mcconnell his leadership position.'  although trump hastaken a hit, he can still point to plenty of metrics to show his clout with his party. while only eight senate republicans stood by the president’s push to reverse the election results following the attack on the capitol,roughly two-thirds of house republicans remained with trump. that large group included the top two house republicans:minority leader kevin mccarthy and minority whip steve scalise. trump can also tout the 74 million americans who voted for him in november’s presidential election. ahead of this week, the president’s approval rating among republicans had stayed in the stratosphere  new hampshire state rep. fred doucette, who served as trump's 2016 and 2020 campaign co-chair in the granite state, highlighted that the president is 'absolutely' going to have influence going forward. 'i think he’s going to remain a force,' he told fox news. doucette noted that 'the core trump supporters are republicans but some of the president’s ardent backers are more supporters of the president than necessarily the republican party.' but he also acknowledged that 'anybody would be foolish to say' that this week'sevents weren’t 'going to have an effect. it will definitely have an effect.' the question going forward is -- how much of an effect? 'it's just way too early to know what happens,'carney added.",2021-01-09,0.9927,Very Positive,"['report', 'panel', 'discuss', 'new', 'restrictions', 'twitter', 'apple', 'move', 'social', 'media',

'president trump continues to be the most powerful, the most influential republican on the planet earth,' gaetz added. 'it's my expectation that while he'll be leaving the white house in several days when his term is lawfully complete, he will continue to weigh in on matters that are important to the tens of millions of americans who voted for him, who believe that this election process that we went through in 2020 still deserves more scrutiny and who expect that there will still be a constituency of people fighting for the america first agenda.' 'this impeachment would be unnecessary, it would be divisive, and it's only being done because democrats want to keep the focus on president trump,' gaetz said. 'you would think that with just nineto 10 days left in the trump presidencyfor this term, you would have democrats eager to focus on what joe biden would be bringing to the country, his exciting picks for the cabinet, but you see they have to continue to hold together a very fragile coalition by maintaining the focus on president trump.' the congressman urged republicans to continue their focus on 'election integrity,'including outside washington, such as 'inspiring state legislatures to have strong voter identificationrequirements,'conducting investigations into the vote-by-mail system, and to not allow election officials to 'deviate from the instructions that state legislatures set on the running of elections and the selection of electors.' gaetz is among a group of republican lawmakers being called on to resign for their efforts against the certification of the electoral college for president-elect joe biden. 'i think that cancellation of members of congress, whether it be calls for hawley and cruz and myself and mo brooks to resign, or calls for even worse, dovetail with what we see with big tech,' gaetz said.'no longer is it acceptable for the political left to participate in elections and try to participate in debate, they're trying to deplatform people who don't agree with them and to say that folks who maybe inspire a different political message are worthy of an expulsion for worse and i don't think that's going to do anything to animate the calls for unity that we've seen across the political spectrum.' gaetz also addressed big tech's removal of trump from their platforms, arguing that the decisionshows they want to 'define the four corners of acceptable debate,' constraining thought and engagement. 'we cannot live in a world where the terms of service on twitter are more important than the terms laid out by our founding fathers in the united states constitution and the bill of rights,' gaetz said. gaetz said he is joining forces with rhode island democrat rep.david cicilline to have 'far more aggressive enforcement of our antirust laws' in order to 'reset the relationship between consumers and the digital platforms that they use.' he also suggested that president trump could take action in the final days of his presidency to 'ensure that people are still able to speak out' about election integrity on social media.",2021-01-10,0.9637,Very Positive,"['matt', 'gaetz', 'joins', 'report', 'discuss', 'dems', 'mission', 'impeach', 'trump', 'censure', 'several', 'gop', 'lawmakers', 'violent', 'capitol', 'breach', 'trump', 'continues', 'powerful', 'influential', 'republican', 'planet', 'earth', 'gaetz', 'added', 'expectation', 'leaving', 'white', 'house', 'several', 'days', 'term', 'lawfully', 'complete', 'continue', 'weigh', 'matters', 'important', 'tens', 'millions', 'americans', 'voted', 'believe', 'election', 'process', 'went', 'still', 'deserves', 'scrutiny', 'expect', 'still', 'constituency', 'people', 'fighting', 'america', 'agenda', 'impeachment', 'unnecessary', 'divisive', 'done', 'democrats', 'want', 'keep', 'focus', 'president', 'trump', 'gaetz', 'think', 'nineto', 'days', 'left', 'trump', 'presidencyfor', 'term', 'democrats', 'eager', 'focus', 'joe', 'biden', 'bringing', 'country', 'exciting', 'picks', 'cabinet', 'see', 'continue', 'hold', 'together', 'fragile', 'coalition', 'maintaining', 'focus', 'president', 'trump', 'congressman', 'urged', 'republicans', 'continue', 'focus', 'integrity', 'outside', 'washington', 'state', 'legislatures', 'strong', 'voter', 'identificationrequirements', 'investigations', 'system', 'allow', 'election', 'officials', 'instructions', 'state', 'legislatures', 'set', 'running', 'elections', 'selection', 'electors', 'gaetz', 'among', 'group', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'called', 'resign', 'efforts', 'certification', 'electoral', 'college', 'joe', 'biden', 'think', 'cancellation', 'members', 'congress', 'whether', 'calls', 'hawley', 'cruz', 'mo', 'brooks', 'resign', 'calls', 'even', 'worse', 'dovetail', 'see', 'big', 'tech', 'gaetz', 'longer', 'acceptable', 'political', 'left', 'participate', 'elections', 'try', 'participate', 'debate', 'trying', 'deplatform', 'people', 'agree', 'say', 'folks', 'maybe', 'inspire', 'different', 'political', 'message', 'worthy', 'expulsion', 'worse', 'think', 'anything', 'animate', 'calls', 'unity', 'seen', 'across', 'political', 'spectrum', 'gaetz', 'addressed', 'big', 'tech', 'removal', 'trump', 'platforms', 'arguing', 'decisionshows', 'want', 'four', 'corners', 'acceptable', 'debate', 'constraining', 'thought', 'engagement', 'live', 'world', 'terms', 'service', 'twitter', 'important', 'terms', 'laid', 'founding', 'fathers', 'united', 'states', 'constitution', 'bill', 'rights', 'gaetz', 'gaetz', 'joining', 'forces', 'rhode', 'island', 'democrat', 'cicilline', 'aggressive', 'enforcement', 'antirust', 'laws', 'order', 'relationship', 'consumers', 'digital', 'platforms', 'use', 'suggested', 'president', 'trump', 'action', 'final', 'days', 'presidency', 'people', 'still', 'able', 'speak', 'election', 'integrity', 'social', 'media']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-draft-new-articles-impeachment-trump-deadly-riot-capitol,FOX,Democrats march toward another impeachment against Trump for deadly riot at Capitol,House Democrats were drafting new articles of impeachment against President Trump on Friday following a deadly riot at the Capitol two days earlier in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential victory.,"January 8, 2021 2:17pm EST","vice president mike pence is expected to attend, according to reports; john roberts reports to the white house. rep. ilhan omar, of minnesota,was also circulating articles of impeachment. pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york had pushed for trump's immediate removal of office through the 25th amendment, arguing it was too risky to keep trump in poweruntil jan. 20, when democrat joe biden is scheduled to be inaugurated. but if vice president mike pence and the cabinet don't remove trump, as the amendment would require, democrats seemed to have broad support among their caucus for a second round of impeachment. (the president's forced removal before his term ends was appearing unlikely friday.) 'it is the hope of members that the president will immediately resign,' pelosi said in a statement friday. 'but if he does not, i have instructed the rules committee to be prepared to move forward with congressman jamie raskin’s 25th amendment legislation and a motion for impeachment. accordingly, the house will preserve every option – including the 25th amendment, a motion to impeach or a privileged resolution for impeachment.' earlier friday, pelosisaid she hadspoken to chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. mark milley about protecting the nuclear codes from what she described as an 'unhinged president.' '[f]ollowing the president’s dangerous and seditious acts, republicans in congress need to ... call on trump to depart his office – immediately,' pelosi wrote in a letter to her fellow democrats. 'if the president does not leave office imminently and willingly, the congress will proceed with our action.' the resolutionalso calls out trump for his jan. 2 phone call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger where he urged the election officialto 'find' enough votes to overturn biden's win in the state -- and appeared to issue subtlethreats if raffensperger failed to do so. trump's actions warrantremoval from office and 'disqualification' to run ever again, the impeachment resolution states. it was unclear when or if this impeachment resolution would get a vote. a few republicans, including sen. ben sasse of nebraska,have expressed an openness to trump's removal from office after his repeated false claims that he won the presidential election in a landslide and urging his supporters to march to the capitol as congress was in the middle of certifying biden's electoral victory. house gop leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., said a second impeachment would further fracturethe country. 'impeaching the president with just 12 days left in his term will only divide our country more,' mccarthy said friday in a statement. 'i have reached out to president-elect biden today and plan to speak to him about how we must work together to lower the temperature and unite the country to solve america’s challenges.' mccarthy was one of 138 house republicans who voted to toss out pennyslvania's electoral college votes early thursday morning whenthe congressional count resumed after the riot. eventually, the election was certified by the joint session of congress with biden winning 306 electoral votestrump's 232. rep. tim ryan, d-ohio, blasted mccarthy as having'no guts' to stand up to trump even after the desecration of the capitol and the death of officerbrian sicknick. ryan supports trump's removal from office. 'he [mccarthy] has his lips firmly attached to president trump's rear end,' ryan said friday.

'i’m going to continue to be the same person that i always have been, which is an individual that has views that many would say are moderate,' the senator highlighted. she added that plans to 'continue in the role that i have, which is one that is not afraid to be in the middle, even if there’s not a lot of people there that are with me.' and murkowski emphasized that she’d like the gop to be the 'party that is inclusive of young people and minorities, and lgbtq and all people everywhere. regardless of demographic or our background, i just, i think the republican party has so much to offer, if we can just get away from them, the personalities that have that have shaped it into a more narrowly defined view.'",2021-01-22,0.9897,Very Positive,"['alaskan', 'gop', 'lawmaker', 'call', 'president', 'quit', 'neil', 'cavuto', 'details', 'world', 'fast', 'forward', 'weeks', 'murkowski', 'friday', 'remains', 'committed', 'staying', 'senate', 'republican', 'conference', 'asked', 'reporters', 'liberal', 'dreams', 'caucus', 'democrats', 'senator', 'dream', 'materialize', 'discouraged', 'times', 'things', 'go', 'caucus', 'party', 'think', 'member', 'feels', 'emphasized', 'absolutely', 'desire', 'move', 'democrat', 'side', 'aisle', 'murkowski', 'served', 'nearly', 'decades', 'senate', 'succeeding', 'father', 'senator', 'lost', 'gop', 'primary', 'much', 'conservative', 'candidate', 'tea', 'party', 'wave', 'election', 'cycle', 'ran', 'successful', 'campaign', 'independent', 'general', 'election', 'winning', 'another', 'term', 'senate', 'murkowski', 'true', 'moderates', 'either', 'party', 'left', 'senate', 'continue', 'person', 'always', 'individual', 'views', 'many', 'say', 'moderate', 'senator', 'highlighted', 'added', 'plans', 'role', 'afraid', 'middle', 'even', 'lot', 'people', 'murkowski', 'emphasized', 'like', 'gop', 'inclusive', 'young', 'people', 'minorities', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'everywhere', 'regardless', 'demographic', 'background', 'think', 'republican', 'party', 'much', 'offer', 'get', 'away', 'personalities', 'shaped', 'narrowly', 'defined', 'view']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-sway-with-republicans-takes-hit-but-he-still-holds-firm-grip-over-gop,FOX,"Trump’s sway with Republicans takes hit, but he still holds firm grip over GOP","President Trump’s sway with Republicans takes hit in public opinion polls, but he still holds a firm grip over GOP","January 18, 2021 11:45am EST","gop must now navigate through trump and trumpism.  but new public opinion poll indicates that while his approval ratings have taken a hit among americans and specifically republicans, his sway over the party he reshaped and ruled over with near-absolute authority during his four years in the white house remains immense. 'trump still retains incredible support from those who voted for him, but his credibility has collapsed among everyone else,' veteran republican pollster frank luntz told fox news. the president’s approval rating has dipped from the low to mid 40’s down to around 40%, according to a real clear politics average of polls conducted in the wake of the storming of the capitol, which resulted in the death of five people including a capitol hill police officer and widespread vandalism of the building. but among republicans, it’s a different story. while trump’s numbers among gop voters has taken a hit, they still remain very healthy. trump’s approval rating among republicans stands at a sky-high 87% in the nbc news/wall street journal poll, down just two points from october. cnn puts the outgoing president’s approval rating at 80%, down 14 points from three months ago. trump’s approval rating among republicans in the abc news/washington post survey remains a robust 79%, a drop of 9 points from october. and the president’s approval rating in the pew research poll stands at 60%, down from 77% in august of last year. luntz noted that 'republicans have always been the 'law and order' party.their opinions of trump have taken a hit because of continued focus on the events of january 6th and their embarrassment about the violence and destruction.' the attack on the capitol came soon after the president urged a large crowd of supporters he addressed at a rally near the white house to march to the capitol and show strength in protesting the certification of an election he’s repeatedly and falsely claimed was 'rigged.' but two-thirds of republicans questioned in the nbc news/wall street journal poll said trump’s words and actions related to the storming of the capitol has not changed how they feel about their vote in november for trump, with nearly three in 10 republicans saying it reinforces their vote for trump, and only 5% say it makes them regret their vote. those sentiments seem to be reflected in the actions of gop members of congress. nearly two-thirds of house republicans -- even after the joint session of congress was delayed six hours after the attack on the capitol -- objected to certifying the electoral college results in two states that biden narrowly edged overtrump in the presidential election. and 197 house republicans voted last wednesday against impeaching trump, with just 10 gop lawmakers joining all 222 democrats in voting for impeachment. ahead of the insurrection, trump had vowed to play an influential role in the party going forward, threatening to back primary challenges to republicans up for reelection in 2022 who didn’t support the president’s unsuccessful push to upend his election defeat to biden. trump was also flirting with a 2024 presidential run to try and win back the white house. now, with the possibility of being barred from running for federal office ever again if he’s convicted in the senate impeachment trial, trump’s future political ambitions are in a precarious state. according to the pew research poll, 57% of republicans want trump to remain a major political figure for years to come. four in 10 republicans questioned in the survey disagreed. and 55% of republicans surveyed in the usa today/suffolk university poll said they would definitely vote for trump again if he ran for president in 2024. while that’s a very strong number, it’s down from 71% of republicans who said the same thing in december.",2021-01-18,0.9844,Very Positive,"['gop', 'must', 'navigate', 'trump',

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-managers-close-argument-lee-objection,FOX,Mike Lee's objection to ‘false’ Trump impeachment evidence causes stir as Dems set for closing arguments,"The House impeachment managers will continue their case Thursday, after making their argument over the last two days that Trump should be convicted of inciting an insurrection on the Capitol.","February 11, 2021 7:56am EST","the managers are expected to continue to argue that trump had planted the seeds of the attack on the capitol for months by sayinghe could not have lostthe presidential election unless there was voter fraud; failing to condemn violence from his supporters; inviting a mass of his supporters to washington, d.c., on jan. 6;telling them to go to the capitol; and failing to make efforts to stop the mob once the riot began. trump's defense could technically start making their arguments thursday if the house managers end their opening statements early, but they are more likely to begin on friday. trump's defense team is arguing that he was within his first amendment rights in making his claims about the election and he cannot be held responsible for the actions of the criminals that stormed the capitol. they also say the impeachment managers are taking trump's comments out of context. the impeachment managers have tried to preempt some of trump's anticipated defenses early in the trial while also maintaining a solemn tone, playing gruesome video of rioters attacking capitol police, seeking out lawmakers and their staffs and calling for the death of former vice president mike pence, among others. they've particularly leaned on security footage from the capitol showing the number of close calls lawmakers had where they could have been swept up and potentially injured or killed by the mob. 'obviously very troubling to see the great violence that our capitol police and others are subjected to,' sen mitt romney, r-utah, said when asked about video showing officer eugene goodman, lauded as a hero for his actions in the riot, guiding the senator to safety. 'it tears you at your heart and brings tears to your eyes, that was overwhelmingly distressing and emotional.' but the solemn tone was broken wednesday during a spat between lee, r-utah, and the impeachment managers -- and it could escalate thursday if the impeachment managers try to 'relitigate' the point as schumer, d-n.y., said may happen. as lead impeachment manager rep. jamie raskin, d-md., was preparing to close down the house's arguments for the day, lee requested to be recognized and said that the impeachment managers had incorrectly described what happened when trump called his phone on jan. 6. he asked that the statement, made by rep. david cicilline, d-r.i., be removed from the record of the trial. 'statements were attributed to me moments ago by the house impeachment managers... relating to the content of conversations between ... president trump and senator tuberville. they were not made by me. they're not accurate and they're contrary to fact,' lee said. 'i move... that they be stricken from the record,' lee continued. senate president pro tempore patrick leahy, d-vt., who is presiding over the impeachment trial, said that lee's motion was not provided in the rules. lee then appealed the ruling and requested a roll call vote. but leahy's statement on what the rule was was not clear and prompted minutes of conversations about what exactly the senate was about to vote on. schumer put the senate into a quorum call 'while we work this out.' it appears that what lee was objecting to was related to acall that was reportedly made by trump to lee's phone during the capitol riot. the call was actually meant for sen. tommy tuberville, r-ala., and lee handed his phone to the tuberville so he could speak with trump. cicilline claimed that lee said the content of the call was trump asking tuberville to further delay the certification of the election results. but lee claimed that he had never said such a thing. notably, however,trump lawyer rudy giuliani also during the riot left a voicemail with lee in which he was explicitly asking tuberville to delay the certification of the election results. the recording of that voicemail has been widely reported, but there is no such record of the conversation between tuberville and trump. 'tonight the house impeachment managers made false statements mischaracterizing sen. lee’s account of a phone conversation between president trump and senator tuberville,' a spokesperson for lee said wednesday.'sen. lee objected and asked that the false statements be stricken from the record. the house managers agreed to withdraw those statements.' tuberville told politico wednesday thatthere was not much to his conversation with trump. 'i don’t know if you’ve ever talked to president trump – you don’t get many words in. but he didn’t get a chance to say a whole lot because i said ‘mr. president, they just took the vice president out, i’ve got to go,'' tuberville said.'that’s pretty much what it was.' after several minutes,the senators came to an agreement that would allow them to end the hearing for the night. lee withdrew his request for a vote appealing leahy's ruling and schumer withdrew his quorum call, asking raskin to make a statement. 'the impeachment manager mr. cicillinecorrectly and accurately quoted a newspaper account which the distinguished senator has taken objection to. so we're happy to withdraw it on the grounds that it is not true and we are going to withdraw it this evening without any prejudice to the ability to resubmit if possible and then we could debate it if we need it,' raskin said. he added that it 'is much ado about nothing' because the specific comment is 'not critical' to the case. 'it's not true,' lee could be heard saying in the background as raskin went through his explanation.'you're not the one being cited as a witness here,' he said. 'we may relitigate it tomorrow if we have to,' schumer said, before closing down senate proceedings for the night. tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington,

'democrats talk a big game on diversity in the courts and about how representation matters, but their records don’t match their rhetoric,' article iii project founder and president mike davis said of the analysis, first shared with fox news. 'these democrats are quick to weaponize race and gender to achieve their progressive political goals, but diversity in the workplace, racial progress, and gender equality clearly aren’t their real priorities.' davis added: 'as democrats prepare to nominate a black woman to the supreme court, remember how they treated clarence thomas, janice rogers brown, miguel estrada, and amy coney barrett during their confirmation processes.' democrats said they voted against these nominees based on their qualifications or their ideology. all three also voted against judge patrick bumatay when he was nominated to the 9th circuit court of appeals. bumatay is asian-american and gay. then-ranking member of the senate judiciary committee sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., said she did not think bumatay had the experience to sit on an appeals court. 'mr. bumatay has only argued twice before any appellate court, state or federal, furthermore he identified only 10 appellate briefs, motions or other filings that he has submitted in his legal career,' she said. 'notably three of those filings had occurred after the white house interviewed mr. bumatay in connection to his present nomination to the ninth circuit.' 'the president’s view is that anyone who’s saying that that’s not possible or we can’t find the most eminently qualified person [by selecting a black woman] — that’s ludicrous,' white house press secretary jen psaki said last month. 'i mean, that’s suggesting that a black woman should not be a part of the most important court in our nation, that there aren’t black women who have distinguished themselves by rising to the top of the legal profession with the strongest credentials imaginable,' she added. democrats also say that even though trump appointed some high-profile minority nominees, including selecting the first woman with school aged children for the supreme court, a disproportionate number of his picks were white men. biden is expected to announce his supreme court pick this week – or next monday at the very latest – after he said his plan was to choose his nominee by the end of this month. among the most discussed candidates are south carolina district court judge j. michelle childs, d.c. circuit court judge ketanji brown jackson, california supreme court justice leondra kruger, and naacp legal defense fund president sherrilyn ifill. tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington, d.c.",2022-02-21,0.9931,Very Positive,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'chairman', 'dick', 'durbin', 'meanwhile', 'voted', 'nominees', 'according', 'analysis', 'sheldon', 'whitehouse', 'vocal', 'members', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'voted', 'trump', 'minority', 'appeals', 'court', 'nominees', 'analysis', 'article', 'iii', 'project', 'identifies', 'dozens', 'minority', 'federal', 'court', 'nominees', 'trump', 'former', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'least', 'three', 'senators', 'opposed', 'talk', 'big', 'game', 'diversity', 'courts', 'representation', 'matters', 'records', 'match', 'rhetoric', 'article', 'iii', 'project', 'founder', 'president', 'mike', 'davis', 'analysis', 'shared', 'news', 'democrats', 'quick', 'weaponize', 'race', 'gender', 'achieve', 'progressive', 'political', 'goals', 'diversity', 'workplace', 'racial', 'progress', 'gender', 'equality', 'clearly', 'real', 'priorities', 'davis', 'added', 'democrats', 'prepare', 'nominate', 'black', 'woman', 'supreme', 'court', 'remember', 'treated', 'clarence', 'thomas', 'janice', 'rogers', 'brown', 'miguel', 'estrada', 'amy', 'coney', 'barrett', 'confirmation', 'processes', 'democrats', 'voted', 'nominees', 'based', 'qualifications', 'ideology', 'three', 'voted', 'judge', 'patrick', 'bumatay', 'nominated', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'bumatay', 'gay', 'member', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'dianne', 'feinstein', 'think', 'bumatay', 'experience', 'sit', 'appeals', 'court', 'bumatay', 'argued', 'twice', 'appellate', 'court', 'state', 'federal', 'furthermore', 'identified', 'appellate', 'briefs', 'motions', 'filings', 'submitted', 'legal', 'career', 'three', 'filings', 'occurred', 'white', 'house', 'interviewed', 'bumatay', 'connection', 'present', 'nomination', 'ninth', 'circuit', 'president', 'view', 'anyone', 'saying', 'possible', 'find', 'eminently', 'qualified', 'person', 'selecting', 'black', 'woman', 'ludicrous', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', 'jen', 'psaki', 'last', 'month', 'mean', 'suggesting', 'black', 'woman', 'part', 'important', 'court', 'nation', 'black', 'women', 'distinguished', 'rising', 'top', 'legal', 'profession', 'strongest', 'credentials', 'imaginable', 'added', 'democrats', 'say', 'even', 'though', 'trump', 'appointed', 'minority', 'nominees', 'including', 'selecting', 'woman', 'school', 'aged', 'children', 'supreme', 'court', 'disproportionate', 'number', 'picks', 'white', 'men', 'biden', 'expected', 'announce', 'supreme', 'court', 'pick', 'week', 'next', 'monday', 'latest', 'plan', 'choose', 'nominee', 'end', 'month', 'among', 'discussed', 'candidates', 'south', 'carolina', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'michelle', 'childs', 'circuit', 'court', 'judge', 'ketanji', 'brown', 'jackson', 'california', 'supreme', 'court', 'justice', 'leondra', 'kruger', 'naacp', 'legal', 'defense', 'fund', 'president', 'sherrilyn', 'ifill', 'tyler', 'olson', 'capitol', 'hill', 'producer', 'news', 'washington']"

'the crimes charged in the indictment involve active participation in an insurrection attempting to violently overthrow the united states government. by chansley’s own admissions to the fbi and news media, the insurrection is still in progress and he intends to continue participating,' the filing reads. 'strong evidence, including chansley’s own words and actions at the capitol, supports that the intent of the capitol rioters was to capture and assassinate elected officials in the united states government. chansley left a note on the senate chamber dais, where vice president mike pence had been presiding over the session just minutes before, warning 'it's only a matter of time, justice is coming,'' the document continued. 'when questioned as to the meaning of that statement, chansley went on a lengthy diatribe describing current and past united states political leaders as infiltrators, specifically naming vice president mike pence, former president barack obama, former senator hillary clinton and u.s. president-elect joe biden as infiltrators involved in various types of wrongdoing,' prosecutors added. 'although he stated his note was not a threat, the government strongly disagrees.' a lawyer for chansley did not immediately respond to a request for comment from fox news. the claims by the government that rioters wanted to 'capture and assassinate' officials are not necessarily surprising. some who stormed the capitol did so while chanting, 'hang mike pence.' but whatisbeing alleged by the government itself in a court document makes clear the danger of what amounted to an insurrection aimed at stopping the certification of president-elect joe biden's victory. it also brings into focus the fact that the results of the riot that killed multiple people could have been much worse. underscoring fears of further unrest during biden's inauguration next wednesday –and why prosecutors don't want chansley released –chansley said he would return to d.c. on jan. 20 if he could.'i’ll still go, you better believe it,' he told the fbi, according to the filing. 'for sure i’d want to be there, as a protestor, as a protestor, f-----’ a.' 'some say the riots were caused by antifa,' house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., said on the house floor wednesday. 'there's absolutely no evidence of that, and conservatives should be the first to say so.' mccarthy's been one of the republicans who lays the blame for the storming of the capitol at president trump's feet. at least one left-wing activist, john sullivan, was arrested in the wake of the riots after allegedly egging on pro-trump rioters. he told fox news he was at the riot to 'document' it. but almost all of those arrested for storming the capitol were public supporters of trump, like chansley. 'in an interview with nbc news before his arrest, chansley boasted about his involvement in the mob that infiltrated the capitol, driving congress people and staffers to flee in fear of their lives,' the government filing against chansley reads. ''the fact that we had a bunch of our traitors in office hunker down, put on their gas masks and retreat into their underground bunker, i consider that a win,'' it quotes chansley as saying. 'chansley stated that he drove to washington, d.c. as a part of a group effort, with other 'patriots'from arizona, at the request of the president that all 'patriots'come to d.c. on january 6, 2021.' tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington, d.c.",2021-01-15,-0.9915,Very Negative,"['fbi', 'preparing', 'violent', 'extremism', 'surge', 'ahead', 'inauguration', 'day', 'national', 'security', 'analyst', 'rebecca', 'grant', 'offers', 'insight', 'ahead', 'detention', 'hearing', 'chansley', 'scheduled', 'friday', 'afternoon', 'prosecutors', 'filed', 'document', 'outlining', 'believe', 'chansley', 'released', 'ahead', 'trial', 'among', 'reasons', 'prosecutors', 'say', 'severe', 'nature', 'accusing', 'chansley', 'crimes', 'charged', 'indictment', 'involve', 'active', 'participation', 'insurrection', 'attempting', 'violently', 'overthrow', 'united', 'states', 'government', 'chansley', 'admissions', 'fbi', 'news', 'media', 'insurrection', 'still', 'progress', 'intends', 'continue', 'participating', 'filing', 'reads', 'evidence', 'including', 'chansley', 'words', 'actions', 'capitol', 'supports', 'intent', 'capitol', 'rioters', 'capture', 'assassinate', 'elected', 'officials', 'united', 'states', 'government', 'chansley', 'left', 'note', 'senate', 'chamber', 'dais', 'vice', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'presiding', 'session', 'minutes', 'warning', 'matter', 'justice', 'coming', 'document', 'continued', 'questioned', 'meaning', 'statement', 'chansley', 'went', 'lengthy', 'diatribe', 'describing', 'current', 'past', 'united', 'states', 'political', 'leaders', 'infiltrators', 'specifically', 'naming', 'vice', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'former', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'former', 'senator', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'joe', 'biden', 'infiltrators', 'involved', 'various', 'types', 'wrongdoing', 'prosecutors', 'added', 'stated', 'note', 'threat', 'government', 'strongly', 'disagrees', 'lawyer', 'chansley', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'news', 'claims', 'government', 'rioters', 'wanted', 'assassinate', 'officials', 'necessarily', 'surprising', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'chanting', 'mike', 'pence', 'whatisbeing', 'alleged', 'government', 'court', 'document', 'makes', 'clear', 'danger', 'amounted', 'insurrection', 'aimed', 'stopping', 'certification', 'joe', 'biden', 'victory', 'brings', 'focus', 'fact', 'results', 'riot', 'killed', 'multiple', 'people', 'much', 'worse', 'underscoring', 'fears', 'unrest', 'biden', 'inauguration', 'next', 'wednesday', 'prosecutors', 'want', 'chansley', 'released', 'return', 'still', 'go', 'better', 'believe', 'fbi', 'according', 'filing', 'sure', 'want', 'protestor', 'protestor', 'f', 'say', 'riots', 'caused', 'antifa', 'house', 'minority', 'leader', 'kevin', 'mccarthy', 'house', 'floor', 'wednesday', 'absolutely', 'evidence', 'conservatives', 'say', 'mccarthy', 'republicans', 'lays', 'blame', 'storming', 'capitol', 'president', 'trump', 'feet', 'least', 'activist', 'john', 'sullivan', 'arrested', 'wake', 'riots', 'allegedly', 'egging', 'rioters', 'news', 'riot', 'almost', 'arrested', 'storming', 'capitol', 'public', 'supporters', 'trump', 'like', 'chansley', 'interview', 'nbc', 'news', 'arrest', 'chansley', 'boasted', 'involvement', 'mob', 'infiltrated', 'capitol', 'driving', 'congress', 'people', 'staffers', 'flee', 'fear', 'lives', 'government', 'filing', 'chansley', 'reads', 'fact', 'bunch', 'traitors', 'office', 'hunker', 'put', 'gas', 'masks', 'retreat', 'underground', 'bunker', 'consider', 'win', 'quotes', 'chansley', 'saying', 'stated', 'drove', 'washington', 'part', 'group', 'effort', 'arizona', 'request', 'president', 'january', 'tyler', 'olson', 'capitol', 'hill', 'producer', 'news', 'washington']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-trump-impeachment-dodge-house-democrats,FOX,Biden avoids firm position on Trump impeachment as House Dems ramp up,"President-elect Joe Biden is avoiding taking a firm position on removing President Trump from office ahead after last week's Capitol riot, as House Democrats signaled they would introduce articles of impeachment against him on Monday.","January 11, 2021 9:30am EST","but denounces trump over capitol riot  'with every new day we learn that the violent insurrection was even worse than we thought. impeaching @potus would be just the bare minimum of what needs to occur,' lieu tweeted. 'donald trump should be prosecuted for a range of felonies, including inciting an insurrection and felony murder.' biden, over the weekend, said that trump is 'not above the law,' saying that 'justice serves the people — it doesn't protect the powerful.' but the president-elect has stopped short of outright calling for trump’s impeachment or for vice president mike pence and the trump cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment. when asked whether he supported bringing articles of impeachment, or invoking the 25th, which both house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and senate democratic leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., have called for, biden said it was up to congress to decide. 'i’m focused on the virus, the vaccine and economic growth. what congress decides to do is for them to decide,' biden said. 'we’re going to do our job and the congress can decide how to proceed with theirs.' he added: 'that's a decision for the congress to make. i am focused on my job.' biden, though, said that he has 'been saying for now well over a year that he’s not fit to serve,' calling trump 'one of the most incompetent presidents in the history of the united states of america.' biden emphasized that 'it's important to get on with the business of getting him out of office,' but he said 'the quickest way that that will happen is us being sworn in on the 20th. what action happens before or after that is a judgment for the congress to make.' biden added: 'if we were six months out, we should be doing everything to get him out of office, impeaching him again. trying to invoke the 25th amendment. whatever it took to get him out of office. but i am focused now on us taking control as president and vice president on the 20th and getting our agenda moving as quickly as we can.' biden’s comments came as the democrat-controlled house reached more than 200 co-sponsors for an article of impeachment against trump, which they plan to introduce monday. there are 222 democrats in the house. 'it is the hope of members that the president will immediately resign,'pelosi said in a statement saturday after an hourslong phone call with democrats on impeachment.'but if he does not, i have instructed the rules committee to be prepared.' it’s unlikely that impeachment would make it through both the house and the senate by jan. 20, when president-elect biden is inaugurated. rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., has called for trumpto be removed through the 25th amendment, the first gop member of the house to publicly do so. meanwhile, frequent trump critic sen. ben sasse, r-neb., has said he would 'definitely consider' impeachment articles if they were brought forth. sen. lisa murkowski, r-alaska, becamethe first republican to call on the president to resign friday, and said trump’s leadership of the gop leaves her questioning whether to remain in the party. meanwhile, schumer and other democrats have urged pence to 'immediately' invoke the 25th amendment, calling it the 'quickest and most effective way' to remove trump from office. schumer, though, warned that if pence and the cabinet did not take that path, congress could 'reconvene to impeach the president.' the 25th amendment includes a section allowing the vice president and a majority of cabinet members to declare a president 'unable' to perform the job. a senior trump administration official told fox news that pence has not been involved in any 25th amendment conversations. the calls for trump’s removal come after the president spoke at a rally wednesday, telling supporters that he would 'never concede,' and repeated unsubstantiated claims that the election was 'stolen' from him and that he won in a 'landslide.' during his remarks, he renewed pressure on pence, claiming that he should decertify the results of the presidential election and send it 'back to the states,' claiming that if he did that, trump would be president for another four years. trump’s remarks came ahead of a joint session of congress to certify the results of the presidential election. as members of the house and senate raised objections to certain electoral votes, both chambers called for a recess and left their chambers as pro-trump protesters breached the capitol building. washington, d.c., police said the security breach at the capitol resulted in four deaths –including a woman who had been shot inside the building –and at least 70 arrests. congress later returned and certified the electoral college vote early thursday, formally giving joe biden his presidential victory. white house deputy chief of staff dan scavino posted a statement from the president on twitter early thursday morning, saying: 'even though i totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on january 20th.' 'i have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,'trump said. 'while this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to make america great again!' the house voted to impeach trump in december 2019, but the senate acquitted him on both articles of impeachment –abuse of power and obstruction of congress –in february 2020. the house impeachment inquiry began after the president, during a phone call in july 2019, pressed ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, to look into biden’srole pressing for the ouster of a ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of burisma holdings –a ukrainian natural gas firm where his son, hunter, sat on the board. the president’s request came after millions in u.s. military aid to ukraine had been frozen, which democrats cited as a quid pro quo

'the president of the united states summoned this mob, assembled the moband lit the flame of this attack. everything that followed was his doing,' cheney continued.'none of this would have happened without the president. the president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. he did not. there has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the united states of his office and his oath to the constitution.' as top democrats lobbied on the house floor to maximize the bipartisan support for their article of impeachment, they cited cheney over and over while looking at their republican colleagues. meanwhile, some of the most staunchly pro-trump house republicans slammed cheney as others defended the top republican, who is seen as a potential future speaker of the house. house rules committee chairman jim mcgovern, d-mass., was the first to reference cheney, asking that her statement be placed in the congressional record as debate on the rules for impeachment got underway. he named her at least once. house majorityleader steny hoyer, d-md., was the next to reference cheney –he did so at least 14 times on the house floor wednesday. 'this attack was not from abroad,' hoyer said. 'it was, as liz cheney said, summoned, assembledand inflamedby the president of the united states of america.' rep. jamie raskin, d-md., who will be the lead impeachment manager when the matter goes to trial in the senate, also mentioned cheney at least three times. 'cheney says there's never been a greater betrayal by a president of the united states of his office and his oath to the constitution,' raskin said. 'read ms. cheney's statement. let's come together and impeach the president for this high crime against the republic. we don't have a minute to spare. he is a clear and present danger to the people.' cheney herself did not speak on the house floor wednesday. cheney's move to back impeachment angered some of the president's most vocal allies in the house –most notably house judiciary committee ranking member jim jordan, r-ohio, who said cheney should resign as the gop conference chair. those members were joined by freshman reps. matt rosendale, r-mont., andbob good., r-va. 'her decision to impeach the president does not represent the majority of our conference. it has only served to become a democrat talking point to be used against our party during this impeachment debate,' good said. 'leadership is a privilegeand carries great responsibility. i believe that privilege has been violated, and i am calling for her to step down as republican conference chair.' but many other house republicans backed cheney, including those who did not vote to impeach trump. a spokesman for house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., told fox news he does not support efforts to oust her as the gop conference chair. mccarthy opposed impeaching trump but said the president was partially responsible for the carnage at the capitol last week during his wednesday floor speech. 'let’s get some truth on the record: @liz_cheney has a hell of a lot more backbone than most, & is a principled leader with a fierce intellect,' rep. dan crenshaw, r-texas, who voted against impeaching trump, said.'she will continue to be a much needed leader in the conference, with my full support. we can disagree without tearing eachother (sic) apart.' added rep. mike gallagher, r-wis.: 'make no mistake: @replizcheney is a principled leader and we are lucky to have her in our conference. she has my full support.' 'congressman buck does not support the freedom caucus letter calling for the removal of rep. cheney,' a spokeswoman for rep. ken buck, r-colo., a prominent member of the freedom caucus, told fox news on thursday. a number of other republicanswho did not back impeachment have voiced their support for cheney in recent hours, including multiple members ofthe house freedom caucus. and reps. adam kinzinger, r-ill., john katko, r-n.y., and peter meijer, r-mich., who voted for impeachment, have supported cheney as well. indecision from house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and public quibbling between senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., havemade the next steps on the impeachment trial in the senate unclear. but schumermade very clear he intends to hold the trial once he becomes majority leaderif mcconnell does not initiate it on his own in the coming days. and it's widely expected that at least some senate republicans will vote to convict trump. mcconnell has even left the door open to voting to convict trump himself.

'why aren't you doing what your constituents wanted you to do?' said cindy witke. 'i went against people who said not to vote for you because i believed in you. i've lost that belief.' nancy eardley accused meijer, the only first-term legislator to back impeachment on jan. 13, of betraying the district within two weeks of taking office. 'i don't know that there's really much you can say that will ever change my mind and not work toward primarying you out after two years,' she said, claiming no court looked at evidence of election fraud. meijer said trump told 'two fundamental lies' after losing to democrat joe biden — falsely stating that the election had been stolen and that jan. 6, the day congress counted electoral votes, was a chance to 'stop the steal.' trump, who had exhorted his supporters to 'fight like hell' shortly before they swarmed the capitol, took close to 2 1/2 hours to issue a video urging them to go home despite the riot having turned deadly, meijer said. 'this was a moment when we needed leadership and the president, in my view, did not show that,' he said. one participant, kim reeder, thanked meijer for his vote. 'i didn't vote for you, but right now i'm sure glad you're my representative,' she said. impeachment took up half of the hourlong forum. other questioners asked about the next federal covid-19 relief plan, student debt forgiveness, gun rights and the role of pharmacy benefit managers in drug costs. at least one republican has already vowed to challenge meijer in the 2022 primary: tom norton, who finished third to meijer in a five-way primary last year. meijer in november won the open, longtime gop-held seat by nearly 6 percentage points over a democrat, a larger margin than trump’s 3-point victory there. meijer acknowledged that a majority of republicans in his district, 'maybe a strong majority,' are upset with his impeachment decision. 'that weighed on me. that was one of the reasons why i felt ultimately sickened by having to take this vote,' he said.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/active-duty-troops-ordered-to-stage-at-bases-outside-washington-amid-riots,FOX,Active-duty troops ordered to stage at bases outside Washington amid riots,"Defense Secretary Mark Esper has ordered military police active-duty troops from Fort Bragg and Fort Drum and a ready battalion from the 82nd Airborne to stage in the Washington, D.C. area at Maryland's Andrews Air Force Base and Virginia's Fort Belvoir, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.","June 2, 2020 1:46pm EDT","kristin fisher reports from the white house on the president's rose garden remarks and visit to the historic d.c. church burned in the riots. in remarks monday evening, trump said he was 'an ally of all peaceful protesters,' but took a hard-line stance against those who choose violence. 'we will end it now,' trump said. the president urged governors to seek the aid of the national guard, warningthat if states and cities fail to protect their residents, he will send the military to do it instead. during his remarks, however, trump stopped short of invoking the insurrection act. senior administration officials told fox news tuesdaymorning thatit is being “seriously considered,” but onlyas a “last resort.”the white house hopes thethreatof invoking it will be enough to push mayors and governors across the country to crack down on protesters and “dominate the streets.” meanwhile, asenior administration official told fox news that contrary to what trump said in a phone call with governors, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. mark milley is not in charge of the response to protests. “general milley’s role has not changed,' the official said. 'he is the senior military adviser to the president. he is not issuing orders to the governors or overseeing national guard troops in washington, d.c.' former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. martin dempsey took issue on twitter with the term “battle space” that had beenused by esper, and language onthe president's call with governors to“get control of the battle space,” suggesting the u.s. military should be used to stamp out protests. former special operations commander general tony thomas, a well-respected army ranger also objected to this language. 'the 'battle space'of america??? not what america needs to hear...ever, unless we are invaded by an adversary or experience a constitutional failure...ie a civil war,' thomas tweeted. many top pentagon leaders are opposed to such drastic measures, andsome current and former officialshave expressed frustration that the u.s. military is being used as a “prop“ by the president in a standoff with violent protesters who have taken to the streets in the aftermath of the death of george floyd, the minneapolis man who died in police custody may 25 after an officer kneeled on his neck for more than eightminutes. meanwhile, the national guard has been activated in more than half the country. a national guard statement on tuesday said governors in 28 states and d.c. have activated thousands of guard members to help local law enforcement. some other governors have rejected the president's offers to deploy the national guard and criticized his suggestion to involve armed forces. illinois gov. j.b. pritzker also pushed back against trump's suggestion of using the military. 'i reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of illinois,' pritzker told cnn. d.c. mayor muriel bowser criticized trump's use of federal police to clear an area in d.c.'s lafayette square monday evening. also monday night, arlington county withdrew police officers from d.c. who had been present as part of an agreement with the district that may now be in jeopardy. 'the county is re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations,' the county said in a news release.",2020-06-02,-0.9927,Very Negative,"['kristin', 'fisher', 'reports', 'white', 'house', 'president', 'rose', 'garden', 'remarks', 'visit', 'historic', 'church', 'burned', 'riots', 'remarks', 'monday', 'evening', 'trump', 'ally', 'peaceful', 'protesters', 'took', 'stance', 'choose', 'violence', 'end', 'trump', 'president', 'urged', 'governors', 'seek', 'aid', 'national', 'guard', 'warningthat', 'states', 'cities', 'fail', 'protect', 'residents', 'send', 'military', 'instead', 'remarks', 'however', 'trump', 'stopped', 'short', 'invoking', 'insurrection', 'act', 'senior', 'administration', 'officials', 'news', 'tuesdaymorning', 'thatit', 'seriously', 'considered', 'onlyas', 'last', 'white', 'house', 'hopes', 'thethreatof', 'invoking', 'enough', 'push', 'mayors', 'governors', 'across', 'country', 'crack', 'protesters', 'dominate', 'meanwhile', 'asenior', 'administration', 'official', 'news', 'contrary', 'trump', 'phone', 'call', 'governors', 'chairman', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'mark', 'milley', 'charge', 'response', 'protests', 'general', 'milley', 'role', 'changed', 'official', 'senior', 'military', 'adviser', 'president', 'issuing', 'orders', 'governors', 'overseeing', 'national', 'guard', 'troops', 'washington', 'former', 'chairman', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'martin', 'dempsey', 'took', 'issue', 'twitter', 'term', 'battle', 'space', 'beenused', 'esper', 'language', 'onthe', 'president', 'call', 'governors', 'get', 'control', 'battle', 'space', 'suggesting', 'military', 'used', 'stamp', 'protests', 'former', 'special', 'operations', 'commander', 'general', 'tony', 'thomas', 'army', 'ranger', 'objected', 'language', 'america', 'america', 'needs', 'hear', 'ever', 'unless', 'invaded', 'adversary', 'experience', 'constitutional', 'failure', 'ie', 'civil', 'war', 'thomas', 'tweeted', 'many', 'top', 'pentagon', 'leaders', 'opposed', 'drastic', 'measures', 'andsome', 'current', 'former', 'officialshave', 'expressed', 'frustration', 'military', 'used', 'prop', 'president', 'standoff', 'violent', 'protesters', 'taken', 'streets', 'aftermath', 'death', 'george', 'floyd', 'minneapolis', 'man', 'died', 'police', 'custody', 'may', 'officer', 'kneeled', 'neck', 'eightminutes', 'meanwhile', 'national', 'guard', 'activated', 'half', 'country', 'national', 'guard', 'statement', 'tuesday', 'governors', 'states', 'activated', 'thousands', 'guard', 'members', 'help', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'governors', 'rejected', 'president', 'offers', 'deploy', 'national', 'guard', 'criticized', 'suggestion', 'involve', 'armed', 'forces', 'illinois', 'gov', 'pritzker', 'pushed', 'back', 'trump', 'suggestion', 'using', 'military', 'reject', 'notion', 'federal', 'government', 'send', 'troops', 'state', 'illinois', 'pritzker', 'mayor', 'muriel', 'bowser', 'criticized', 'trump', 'use', 'federal', 'police', 'clear', 'area', 'lafayette', 'square', 'monday', 'evening', 'monday', 'night', 'arlington', 'county', 'withdrew', 'police', 'officers', 'present', 'part', 'agreement', 'district', 'may', 'jeopardy', 'county', 'agreements', 'allowed', 'officers', 'put', 'compromising', 'position', 'endangered', 'health', 'safety', 'people', 'around', 'purpose', 'worthy', 'mutual', 'aid', 'obligations', 'county', 'news', 'release']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-targeted-look-investigations-involving-former-president-from-russia-mar-a-lago,FOX,Trump targeted: A look at the investigations involving the former president; from Russia to Mar-a-Lago,"Investigations are nothing new for former President Trump, whose administration, and post-presidency, have been plagued by probes into his family's business, his campaign and more.","August 11, 2022 2:00am EDT","fox news correspondent david lee miller has the latest on questioning from the ny attorney general's office over the investigation into trump's family real estate business on 'special report.' this week alone, trump, again, found himself in the line of fire. sources told fox news that fbi agents would not allow trump’s attorneys to watch as they raided the former president's private residence. one source said fbi agents took boxes and documents without reviewing them on the property—only to investigate them later. the nara notified congress in february that the agency recovered the 15 boxes from mar-a-lago and 'identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes.' the matter was referred to the justice department by nara. trump, earlier this year, said the national archives did not 'find' the documents, but that they were 'given, upon request.' sources close to the former president said he had been cooperating and there was 'no need' for the raid. classified material that was reportedly confiscated by the fbi during the raid monday included a letter to trump from former president obama, a letter from kim jong un, a birthday dinner menu and a cocktail napkin. then, on tuesday, a federal appeals court paved the way for the house ways and means committee to finally obtain trump’s tax returns from the internal revenue service—something the panel has been trying to obtain since 2019, under a law that permits the disclosure of an individual's tax returns to the congressional committee. trump may seek emergency intervention measures from the supreme court in an attempt to temporarily block any release of these tax records. 'i did nothing wrong, which is why, after five years of looking, the federal, state and local governments, together with the fake news media, have found nothing,' trump said in a statement wednesday morning. 'i once asked, ‘if you’re innocent, why are you taking the fifth amendment?’ now i know the answer to that question,' he continued. 'when your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated witch hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the fake news media, you have no choice.' trump added: 'accordingly, under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, i declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the united states constitution.' a spokesperson for the new york state attorney general’s office confirmed that the office conducted trump’s deposition. 'attorney general letitia james took part in the deposition during which mr. trump invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination,' the spokesperson said. 'attorney general james will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead.' the spokesperson added: 'our investigation continues.' however, trump’s republican allies are seeing a pattern, and encouraging him to continue to fight back. 'before he's in the white house, they go after him. while he's in the white house, they go after him, and they're continuing to do so now that he's left,' the top republican on the house judiciary committee rep. jim jordan, r-ohio, told fox news. 'it actually started before he was even president.' when trump took office in january 2017, the fbi was in the middle of conducting a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate donald trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with russia to influence the 2016 election. that investigation was referred to inside the bureau as 'crossfire hurricane,' and began on july 31, 2016. in september 2016, the cia properly forwarded that information through a counterintelligence operational lead (ciol) to then-fbi director james comey and then-deputy assistant director of counterintelligence peter strzok, with the subject line: 'crossfire hurricane.' fox news first obtained and reported on the ciol, which stated: 'the following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.' 'an exchange [redacted] discussing us presidential candidate hillary clinton’s approval of a plan concerning us presidential candidate donald trump and russian hackers hampering us elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server,' the referral states. it is unclear how the fbi handled that memo. special counsel john durham is currently investigating the origins of the fbi's trump-russia probe. after trump’s victory and during the presidential transition period, comey briefed trump on the now-infamous anti-trump dossier, containing salacious allegations of purported coordination between trump and the russian government. it was authored by christopher steele, an ex-british intelligence officer. the doj inspector general later revealed that the unverified dossier helped serve as the basis for controversial foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) warrants obtained against former trump campaign aide carter page. it is now widely known that hillary clinton’s presidential campaign and the democratic national committee funded the dossier through the law firm perkins coie. during the early months of trump’s administration, jeff sessions, who served as attorney general at the time, recused himself from oversight of the fbi’s russia investigation, due to his involvement with the trump campaign, per justice department regulations. then-deputy attorney general rod rosenstein was then tasked with oversight of the investigation. trump, in may 2017, fired then-fbi director james comey. comey, during his june 2017 testimony to congress, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel. 'i asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—i thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,' comey testified. days after comey was fired, rosenstein appointed special counsel robert mueller to take over the fbi’s trump-russia probe. the mueller investigation clouded the trump administration for nearly two years. simultaneously, investigations into trump-russia allegations were launched on capitol hill—in both chambers of congress. the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate intelligence committee opened investigations into whether trump and members of his campaign colluded with russia to influence the 2016 presidential race. neither the house nor senate investigation found evidence of collusion between trump and russia. after nearly two years, mueller’s investigation, which concluded in march 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the trump campaign and russian officials during the 2016 presidential election. mueller, though, did not draw a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice. at the time, then-attorney general bill barr and rosenstein concluded the evidence from the mueller case was 'not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.' once mueller’s findings were made public, congressional democrats seized on the issue of obstruction of justice, and began ramping up investigations on matters that spanned from trump’s personal finances to security clearances for trump administration officials, all whilst the drumbeat of impeachment built within the house democratic caucus. in march 2019, house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler, d-n.y., announced a wide-ranging probe into almost every aspect of trump’s administration, business ventures, and family dealings, subpoenaing more than 81 individuals and entities to investigate 'alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by president trump.' but nadler wasn’t alone— a number of other house panels also stepped up inquiries. the house foreign affairs committee, which was chaired, at the time, by rep. eliot engel, d-n.y., dissolved the panel’s subcommittee on terrorism and re-directed those resources to a subcommittee dedicated, instead, toinvestigations related to trump—specifically his relationships and communications with foreign officials, such as russian president vladimir putin. congressional committees, at the time, were also seeking access to state department employees and contractors with knowledge of trump's communications with putin, including the 'linguists, translators, or interpreters' who participated in or listened to trump-putin meetings. house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff, d-calif., who pushed the trump-russia collusion narrative for years, in 2019, continued his investigation into the matter, claiming he had evidence of collusion, despite mueller’s findings. declassified transcripts from house intelligence committee interviews, which fox news first reported on in 2020, revealed, among other things, that top obama officials acknowledged they hadno 'empirical evidence' of collusion or aconspiracy between the trump campaign and russia in the 2016 election. also in the spring of 2019, the house ways and means committee sued the trump administration, accusing officials of violating federal law by refusing to comply with the panel’s requests and subpoenas for documents related to trump’s tax returns. the house oversight committee, at the time, also subpoenaed trump’s accounting firm, mazars usa llc for his financial information, including annual statements, periodic financial reports and independent auditor reports from mazars, as well as all communications with trump. democrats on the house financial services committee also subpoenaed deutsche bank and capital one over trump’s financial statements. in the middle of the congressional investigations into his finances, trump’s business dealings were also being probed in two separate investigations in new york— one by then-manhattan district attorney cyrus vance and the other by new york attorney general letitia james. trump’s administration was even being investigated by the house oversight committee over security clearances given to officials, probing the process that gave clearances to white house staff. but everything came to a head in july 2019—trump had a phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy. during that call, trump pressed zelenskyy to launch investigations into the biden family’s actions and business dealings in ukraine—specifically hunter biden’s ventures with ukrainian natural gas firm burisma holdings. hunter biden, at the time, was, and still is, under federal criminal investigation for his tax affairs, prompted by suspicious foreign transactions. the president’s request came after millions in u.s. military aid to ukraine had been frozen, which democratsand some witnesseshave cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. democrats also claimed trump was meddling in the next presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a democratic political opponent. trump’s conversation with zelenskyy prompted a whistleblower complaint, which led to the house impeachment inquiry, and ultimately, impeachment proceedings in the senate. the house voted to impeach trump in december 2019 on two counts— abuse of power and obstruction of congress.the senate voted for acquittal in february 2020. 'at some point, you got to ask, you know, the motive,' jordan said of the investigations. 'and the motive is this guy came to town and shook up the place—he changed the clique that exists there in d.c., he took on the clique and the bureaucracy and everything else, and the folks there said, no, we just can't have this, and that's why they go after him so hard.' weeks after trump’s first acquittal, in march 2020, the covid-19 pandemic rocked the world, shutting down the u.s. economy and global markets, with millions of people around the world contractingthe novel coronavirus. trump was accused, throughout, of not taking the virus seriously. democratic senators, including now-vice president kamala harris, called for an investigation into the trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. democrats also said they would create a 9/11-style commission to probe trump’s response. the trump administration, though, launched operation warp speed—a public-private partnership to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus, as the pandemic raged in 2020. under his administration, the food and drug administration approved emergency use authorizations (euas) for the pfizer/biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines. trump in december 2020 signed an executive order that would ensure all americans had access to coronavirus vaccines before the u.s. government could begin aiding nations around the world. in another congressional probe, during the pandemic, trump was hammered by democrats over when he was briefed, and his response to moscow, related to intelligence that russia offered bounties to taliban-linked militants to kill u.s. troops. a year later, during the biden administration, officials admitted that intelligence was unverified. throughout 2020, trump was also criticized for questioning the security of the upcoming presidential election, and for repeatedly saying it would be 'rigged' due to the pandemic-era process of mail-in ballots. biden won the 2020 election, but trump claimed it was stolen, and his legal team filed a slew of lawsuits in battleground states across the nation. on jan. 6, 2021, pro-trump rioters breached the u.s. capitol during a joint session of congress to certify the electoral college results in favor of president biden. trump was permanently banned from facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat and youtube after the riot. the house of representatives then drafted articles of impeachment against him again, and ultimately voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting an insurrection for the jan. 6 capitol riot—making him the first and only president to be impeached, and ultimately acquitted, twice in history. trump's legal team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional 'sham impeachment' against a private citizen, driven by democrats''hatred' for trump and desire to silence a political opponent. the senate voted to acquit, but had trump been convicted, the senate would have moved to bar the 45th presidentfrom holding federal office ever again, preventing a 2024 white house run. and when trump left office, the house select committee to investigate the january 6th attack on the united states capitol began its probe into the capitol riot. that committee has spent more than a year investigating, and launched a series of hearings this summer, some during primetime, in an attempt to capture americans’ attention before the november midterm elections—as they compete with record-high inflation, record-high gas prices, shortages in baby formula, a looming recession, and more for political attention. republican study committee chairman jim banks, r-ind., who met with trump at bedminster tuesday evening, reflected on the series of investigations, and said 'america has never had a fighter like donald trump, and that’s why the american people love him.' 'now, more than ever, we need donald trump back in the white house to fight for america,' banks said. 'he has taken a beating from the left, from the left-wing media, from the swamp—and each and every time, he gets back up and keeps fighting back and that’s why he enjoys so much support from house republicans.' jordan told fox news that democrats are 'afraid he is going to run again, which i want him to do.' 'and he’s going to win,' jordan said. 'he’s going to come and continue to shake up the town and stand up for ‘we the people,’ and not the bureaucratic swamp.' and banks told fox news that what happened at mar-a-lago 'unifies republicans in our outrage.' 'it will only backfire on the left as they see that the american people stand with president trump,' banks said. 'and all of the investigations that have added up over the years--this should not happen in america.' banks told fox news that should the republicans take back the majority in the house of representatives in november’s midterm elections, jordan will be chairman of the house judiciary committee. 'if there has ever been the right guy, in the right place in american politics—it is going to be jim jordan chairing the house judiciary committee,' he said. 'those committee hearings should be on primetime—on live television—for the american people to tune in.' as for trump, banks told fox news that the former president 'has made up his mind' about whether he will run for re-election in 2024—a decision he will make public in 'a matter of time.' brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or

John Katko of New York are planning to support Democrats' effort to impeach President Trump after last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol, Fox News has confirmed.","January 12, 2021 6:17pm EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. after cheney's and katko's announcement, rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., later tweeted a statement backing impeachment. 'we are in unchartered waters here, and in history we have not experienced in modern times,' he said. he added that 'there is no doubt in my mind that the president of the united states broke his oath of office and incited this insurrection.' a senior administration official told fox news the white house is expecting anywhere between 10 and 20 republicans to vote in favor of moving ahead with impeachment.the official saidthe number could possibly go above 20, though they doubted that. cheney blasted trump in a statement, saying, 'much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. 'the president of the united states summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,' she said.'everything that followed was his doing. none of this would have happened without the president. the president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. he did not. there has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the united states of his office and his oath to the constitution.i will vote to impeach the president.' a source close to mcconnell told fox news that he was furious with trump.'he's done with trump,' a source said. it’s unclear, though, whether mcconnell will ultimately vote to remove the president in a senate trial.a source very close to mcconnell also disputed the times' reporting, sayingthat nobody was 'pleased' by anything. the call for impeachment has encountered resistance from other republicans, including sen. roy blunt of missouri, who panned the idea on friday.'there is no way we're going to impeach the president. there's not the time to do it,' said blunt. democratic leaders have called for trump's swift removal from office, arguing that heposes a threat to american democracy with less than two weeks before president-elect biden is inaugurated. impeachment has also been viewed as a way to keep trump from holding future office. a vote on the articles is expected on wednesday, exactly a week after the riots that involved violent confrontations with capitol police. at least one officer has died in relation to the riots while another committed suicide after they occurred. sam dorman is a reporter with fox news. you can send tips on twitter @dormanindc or facebook at samdormanfoxnews.",2021-01-12,-0.9939,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'cheney', 'katko', 'announcement', 'adam', 'kinzinger', 'later', 'tweeted', 'statement', 'backing', 'impeachment', 'unchartered', 'waters', 'history', 'experienced', 'modern', 'times', 'added', 'doubt', 'mind', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'broke', 'oath', 'office', 'incited', 'insurrection', 'senior', 'administration', 'official', 'news', 'white', 'house', 'expecting', 'anywhere', 'republicans', 'vote', 'favor', 'moving', 'ahead', 'official', 'saidthe', 'number', 'possibly', 'go', 'though', 'doubted', 'cheney', 'blasted', 'trump', 'statement', 'saying', 'become', 'clear', 'coming', 'days', 'weeks', 'enough', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'summoned', 'mob', 'assembled', 'mob', 'lit', 'flame', 'attack', 'followed', 'none', 'happened', 'without', 'president', 'president', 'immediately', 'forcefully', 'intervened', 'stop', 'violence', 'never', 'greater', 'betrayal', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'office', 'oath', 'vote', 'impeach', 'president', 'source', 'close', 'mcconnell', 'news', 'furious', 'trump', 'done', 'trump', 'source', 'unclear', 'though', 'whether', 'mcconnell', 'ultimately', 'vote', 'remove', 'president', 'senate', 'source', 'close', 'mcconnell', 'disputed', 'times', 'reporting', 'sayingthat', 'nobody', 'anything', 'call', 'impeachment', 'encountered', 'resistance', 'republicans', 'including', 'roy', 'blunt', 'missouri', 'panned', 'idea', 'friday', 'way', 'impeach', 'president', 'blunt', 'democratic', 'leaders', 'called', 'trump', 'swift', 'removal', 'office', 'arguing', 'heposes', 'threat', 'american', 'democracy', 'less', 'weeks', 'biden', 'inaugurated', 'impeachment', 'viewed', 'way', 'keep', 'trump', 'holding', 'future', 'office', 'vote', 'articles', 'expected', 'wednesday', 'exactly', 'week', 'riots', 'involved', 'violent', 'confrontations', 'capitol', 'police', 'least', 'officer', 'died', 'relation', 'riots', 'another', 'committed', 'suicide', 'occurred', 'sam', 'dorman', 'reporter', 'news', 'send', 'tips', 'twitter', 'dormanindc', 'facebook', 'samdormanfoxnews']"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-rips-trump-says-actions-unconscionable-but-trial-was-unconstitutional,FOX,"McConnell rips Trump, says actions 'unconscionable' but trial was unconstitutional","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday said that former President Donald Trump's actions after the presidential election were ""unconscionable"" despite his vote to acquit the former president of the impeachment charge against him. ","February 13, 2021 4:50pm EST","university of baltimore law professor kimberly wehle and former deputy dependent counsel sol wisenberg react on 'america's news hq' but he'd played his cards close to his chest on how he would vote on the impeachment charge that trump incited an insurrection until saturday morning. mcconnell said saturday that trump was wrong, that the senate was right to avoid claiming jurisdiction to convict trump and that trump can still be held accountable in criminal courts. 'there's no question... that president trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,' he said. 'the people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president. and having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth.' he added: 'these criminals were carrying his banners. hanging his flags and screaming their loyalty to him. it was obvious that only president trump could end this... former aides publicly begged him to do so. loyal allies frantically called the administration. the president did not act swiftly. he did not do his job... instead according to public reports he watched television happily as the chaos unfolded, kept pressing his scheme to overturn the election.' mcconnell, however, said that the senate could not vote to convict trump because of the constraints placed on it by the constitution. 'i believe the best constitutional reading shows that article ii, section 4 exhausts the set of persons who can legitimately be impeached, triedor convicted,' mcconnell said. 'it's the president, the vice president and civil officers. we have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen.' but mcconnell foreshadowed that trump still could face accountability for his actions in criminal courts. indeed, there is a criminal investigation in georgia into whether trump broke any laws with his phone call to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger in which he asked raffensperger to 'find' enough votes to hand the state to trump. 'president trump is still liable for everything he did while in office,' mcconnell. 'he didn't get away with anything yet. we have a criminal justice system in this country. we have civil litigation.' mcconnell added that the senate's decision to convict trump does not say that the senate endorses trump's actions, but that 'it simply says that senators did what the former president failed to do. we put our constitutional duty first.' critics of mcconnell have noted that the then-majority leader did not publicly acknowledge that president biden won the presidential election until weeks after the result was clear. but mcconnell defenders say that in the interim, trump was pursuingelection challenges in the courts that he legitimately had the right to pursue. it'safter it became clear those would not succeed that mcconnell congratulated biden on his victory. house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., called mcconnell's comments saturday 'disingenuous' and said he triad to have it 'every which way.' trump's second impeachment was spurred by the jan. 6 riot at the u.s. capitol. trump, after months of making false claims that he'd won the presidential election, called a rally in washington, d.c., with his supporters for the same day congress and then-vice president mike pence were meeting in a joint session to certify the results of the election. but house impeachment managers argued that one comment did not cancel out the balance of trump's other comments in that speech or in the proceeding months. they said he bore fundamental responsibility for the mob that breached the capitol and forced hundreds of lawmakers and the former vice president into hiding while chanting 'hang mike pence,' among other things. tyler olson is a for capitol hill producer for fox news in washington, d.c.",2021-02-13,-0.9856,Very Negative,"['university',

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-impeachment-would-divide-censure-prudent,FOX,McCarthy says impeachment would divide: ‘Censure resolution would be prudent’,"As the House debated impeachment proceedings against President Trump, the GOP leader weighed in: impeachment would further divide, censure is more appropriate. ","January 13, 2021 3:24pm EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com.

'that doesn’t mean the president is free from fault,' mccarthy continued.'the president bears responsibility for wednesday’s attack on congress by mob rioters. he should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. the california lawmaker called on trump to immediately accept his share of responsibility and ensure president-elect biden is able to begin his term successfully. still, he said the president’s response to last week’s capitol riots called for congressional action, 'which is why i think a fact-finding commission and a censure resolution would be prudent,' mccarthy said. censure is a formal reprimand or statement of disapproval. the house has three formal modes of discipline: reprimand, censure and expulsion. asource told fox news on monday that trump told mccarthythat he bears some of the blame for the capitol riot last week during a conversation with the house gop leader. two house republican sources told fox news tuesday that gop leadership will not lobby members to vote against trump’s impeachment, calling it a 'conscience vote for members.' 'i don’t believe it will be whipped,' one senior republican aide said. meanwhile, on the other side of the capitol, sources said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., is furious with the president, and said he is 'done with trump.' the source told fox news that mcconnell believes that impeachment will help rid the republican party of trump and his movement. it is unclear how mcconnell would vote in an impeachment trial, should house democrats vote to impeach trump. it is not clear at this point whether mcconnell would vote to convict, but mcconnell’s office has said the senate majority leader will not invoke the 2004 resolution thatcould bring the senate back before jan. 19 to begin the impeachment trial as soon as possible' mcconnell, r-ky., issued a memo to republican senators earlier this week saying that the senate would not be able to reconvene for business until jan. 19 without the consent of all 100 senators. this would mean, in effect, that the earliest an impeachment trial for trump could begin is 1 p.m. on jan. 20, an hour after president-elect biden is inaugurated. it's almost certain a trump loyalist senator would object to bringing the senate back early.",2021-01-13,-0.2295,Slightly Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'investigations', 'completed', 'hearings', 'held', 'senate', 'confirmed', 'trial', 'begin', 'biden', 'sworn', 'explained', 'house', 'debating', 'animpeachment', 'resolution', 'charges', 'trump', 'inciting', 'insurrection', 'last', 'wednesday', 'capitol', 'riots', 'impeachment', 'divide', 'nation', 'flames', 'partisan', 'division', 'mean', 'president', 'free', 'fault', 'mccarthy', 'continued', 'president', 'bears', 'responsibility', 'wednesday', 'attack', 'congress', 'mob', 'rioters', 'immediately', 'denounced', 'mob', 'saw', 'unfolding', 'california', 'lawmaker', 'called', 'trump', 'immediately', 'accept', 'share', 'responsibility', 'ensure', 'biden', 'able', 'begin', 'term', 'successfully', 'still', 'president', 'response', 'last', 'week', 'capitol', 'riots', 'called', 'congressional', 'action', 'think', 'commission', 'censure', 'resolution', 'prudent', 'mccarthy', 'censure', 'formal', 'reprimand', 'statement', 'disapproval', 'house', 'three', 'formal', 'modes', 'discipline', 'reprimand', 'censure', 'expulsion', 'asource', 'news', 'monday', 'trump', 'mccarthythat', 'bears', 'blame', 'capitol', 'riot', 'last', 'week', 'conversation', 'house', 'gop', 'leader', 'house', 'republican', 'sources', 'news', 'tuesday', 'gop', 'leadership', 'lobby', 'members', 'vote', 'trump', 'impeachment', 'calling', 'vote', 'members', 'believe', 'whipped', 'senior', 'republican', 'aide', 'meanwhile', 'side', 'capitol', 'sources', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'furious', 'president', 'trump', 'source', 'news', 'mcconnell', 'believes', 'impeachment', 'help', 'rid', 'republican', 'party', 'trump', 'movement', 'unclear', 'mcconnell', 'vote', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'house', 'democrats', 'vote', 'impeach', 'trump', 'clear', 'point', 'whether', 'mcconnell', 'vote', 'convict', 'mcconnell', 'office', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'invoke', 'resolution', 'thatcould', 'bring', 'senate', 'back', 'begin', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'soon', 'possible', 'mcconnell', 'issued', 'memo', 'republican', 'senators', 'earlier', 'week', 'saying', 'senate', 'able', 'reconvene', 'business', 'without', 'consent', 'senators', 'mean', 'effect', 'earliest', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'trump', 'begin', 'hour', 'biden', 'inaugurated', 'almost', 'certain', 'trump', 'loyalist', 'senator', 'object', 'bringing', 'senate', 'back', 'early']"

'the option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire situations,' esper said. 'we are not in one of those situations now.i do not support invoking the insurrection act.' in some states, governors have called for the national guard to assist police, which does not require the insurrection act. esper said he was 'very proud' of the national guard members who have gone out to help. but trump has suggested going a step further. esper on wednesday then spoke about trump's controversial appearance at a d.c. church that had previously been harmed by fire. reports had said that the national guard and u.s. park police had used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear peaceful protesters from the area before trump stopped there for a photo opportunity. esper said that national guard members did not do this. the u.s. park police has denied this as well, but did acknowledgeusingsmoke canisters and pepper balls on the protesters. during the brief visit at the boarded-up church, the president stood in frontand posed for photographers while holding up abible. he was accompanied by a variety of aides and officials, including attorney general bill barr, daughter and white house adviser ivanka trump, chief of staff mark meadows, and esper. defense science board member james miller resigned tuesday following the incident, citing esper's failure to oppose the use of force in clearing the crowd. esper said wednesday that while he was aware that he and the president, along with a number of others, were going to the church and lafayette square,he did not know what was going to happen once they got there. he said he'did not know a photo op was happening' at the church before they got there, and that he had not been briefed on law enforcement's plans. esper stated he tries to keep himself and his department out of politics as best he can. esper has also come under fire for his use of the term 'battle space' when describing how governors should control protests.he stopped short of saying he regretted using that military terminology and claimed it was simply part of the military’s lexicon but that he was not referring to the protesters. “in retrospect, i would use a different word,” he said. before discussing these controversies, esper addressed floyd's death, calling it a 'tragedy' and expressing condolences to floyd's family and friends.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/growing-number-of-gop-senators-oppose-impeachment-trial,FOX,Growing number of GOP senators oppose impeachment trial,"A growing number of Republican senators say they oppose holding an impeachment trial, a sign of the dimming chances that former President Donald Trump will be convicted on the charge that he incited a siege of the U.S. Capitol.","January 24, 2021 6:03pm EST","sen. marco rubio, r-fla., tells ‘fox news sunday’ the trump impeachment will be ‘bad’ for the country and ‘stir up’ additional chaos.  arguments in the senate trial will begin the week of feb. 8. leaders in both parties agreed to the short delay to give trump's team and house prosecutors time to prepare and the senate the chance to confirm some of president joe biden's cabinet nominees. democrats say the extra days will allow for more evidence to come out about the rioting by trump supporters who interrupted the congressional electoral count of biden's election victory, while republicans hope to craft a unified defense for trump.  an early vote to dismiss the trial probably would not succeed, given that democrats now control the senate. still, the republican opposition indicates that many gop senators would eventually vote to acquit trump. democrats would need the support of 17 republicans — a high bar — to convict him. when the house impeached trump on jan. 13, exactly one week after the siege, sen. tom cotton, r-ark., said he didn't believe the senate had the constitutional authority to convict trump after he had left office. on sunday, cotton said 'the more i talk to other republican senators, the more they're beginning to line up' behind that argument.  'i think a lot of americans are going to think it's strange that the senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove from office a man who left office a week ago,' cotton said. democrats reject that argument, pointing to a 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who had already resigned and to opinions by many legal scholars. democrats also say that a reckoning of the first invasion of the capitol since the war of 1812, perpetrated by rioters egged on by a president who told them to 'fight like hell' against election results that were being counted at the time, is necessary so the country can move forward and ensure such a siege never happens again. a few gop senators have agreed with democrats, though not close to the number that will be needed to convict trump.  sen. mitt romney, r-utah, said he believes there is a 'preponderance of opinion' that an impeachment trial is appropriate after someone leaves office.  'i believe that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense,' romney said. 'if not, what is?'  but romney, the lone republican to vote to convict trump when the senate acquitted the then-president in last year's trial, appears to be an outlier.  sen. mike rounds, r-s.d., said he believes a trial is a 'moot point' after a president's term is over, 'and i think it's one that they would have a very difficult time in trying to get done within the senate.'  and sen. john cornyn, r-texas, had tweeted on saturday: 'if it is a good idea to impeach and try former presidents, what about former democratic presidents when republicans get the majority in 2022? think about it and let's do what is best for the country.'  on friday, gop sen. lindsey graham of south carolina, a close trump ally who has been helping him build a legal team, urged the senate to reject the idea of a post-presidency trial — potentially with a vote to dismiss the charge — and suggested republicans will scrutinize whether trump's words on jan. 6 were legally 'incitement.'  sen. john barrasso, r-wyo., said democrats were sending a message that 'hatred and vitriol of donald trump is so strong' that they will hold a trial that stops biden's policy priorities from moving. sen. ron johnson, r-wis., suggested democrats are choosing 'vindictiveness' over national security as the new president tries to set up his administration. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, who said last week that trump 'provoked' his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote or argued any legal strategies. the kentucky senator has told his gop colleagues that it will be a vote of conscience. one of house speaker nancy pelosi's nine impeachment managers said trump's encouragement of his loyalists before the riot was 'an extraordinarily heinous presidential crime.' 'i think you will see that we will put together a case that is so compelling because the facts and the law reveal what this president did,' said rep. madeleine dean, d-pa. 'i mean, think back. it was just two-and-a-half weeks ago that the president assembled a mob on the ellipse of the white house. he incited them with his words. and then he lit the match.'  trump's supporters invaded the capitol and interrupted the electoral count as he falsely claimed there was massive fraud in the election and that it was stolen by biden. trump's claims were roundly rejected in the courts, including by judges appointed by trump, and by state election officials. sen. chris coons, d-del., said in an interview with the associated press on sunday that he hopes that evolving clarity on the details of what happened jan. 6 'will make it clearer to my colleagues and the american people that we need some accountability.'  coons questioned how his colleagues who were in the capitol that day could see the insurrection as anything other than a 'stunning violation' of the centuries-old tradition of peaceful transfers of power.  'it is a critical moment in american history and we have to look at it and look at it hard,' coons said.  rubio and romney were on 'fox news sunday,' cotton appeared on fox news channel's 'sunday morning futures' and romney also was on cnn's 'state of the union,' as was dean. rounds was interviewed on nbc's 'meet the press.'",2021-01-24,-0.4879,Slightly Negative,"['marco', 'rubio', 'tells', 'news', 'sunday', 'trump', 'impeachment', 'bad', 'country', 'stir', 'additional', 'chaos', 'arguments', 'senate', 'trial', 'begin', 'week', 'leaders', 'parties', 'agreed', 'short', 'delay', 'give', 'trump', 'team', 'house', 'prosecutors', 'prepare', 'senate', 'chance', 'confirm', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'cabinet', 'nominees', 'democrats', 'say', 'extra', 'days', 'allow', 'evidence', 'come', 'rioting', 'trump', 'supporters', 'interrupted', 'congressional', 'electoral', 'count', 'biden', 'election', 'victory', 'republicans', 'hope', 'craft', 'unified', 'defense', 'trump', 'early', 'vote', 'dismiss', 'trial', 'probably', 'succeed', 'given', 'democrats', 'control', 'senate', 'still', 'republican', 'opposition', 'indicates', 'many', 'gop', 'senators', 'eventually', 'vote', 'acquit', 'trump', 'democrats', 'need', 'support', 'republicans', 'high', 'bar', 'convict', 'house', 'impeached', 'trump', 'exactly', 'week', 'siege', 'tom', 'cotton', 'believe', 'senate', 'constitutional', 'authority', 'convict', 'trump', 'left', 'office', 'sunday', 'cotton', 'talk', 'republican', 'senators', 'beginning', 'line', 'behind', 'argument', 'think', 'lot', 'americans', 'think', 'strange', 'senate', 'spending', 'trying', 'convict', 'remove', 'office', 'man', 'left', 'office', 'week', 'ago', 'cotton', 'democrats', 'reject', 'argument', 'pointing', 'impeachment', 'secretary', 'war', 'already', 'resigned', 'opinions', 'many', 'legal', 'scholars', 'democrats', 'say', 'reckoning', 'invasion', 'capitol', 'since', 'war', 'perpetrated', 'rioters', 'egged', 'president', 'like', 'hell', 'election', 'results', 'counted', 'necessary', 'country', 'move', 'forward', 'ensure', 'siege', 'never', 'happens', 'gop', 'senators', 'agreed', 'democrats', 'though', 'close', 'number', 'needed', 'convict', 'trump', 'mitt', 'romney', 'believes', 'opinion', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'appropriate', 'someone', 'leaves', 'office', 'believe', 'alleged', 'saw', 'incitement', 'insurrection', 'impeachable', 'offense', 'romney', 'romney', 'lone', 'republican', 'vote', 'convict', 'trump', 'senate', 'acquitted', 'last', 'year', 'trial', 'appears', 'outlier', 'mike', 'rounds', 'believes', 'trial', 'point', 'president', 'term', 'think', 'difficult', 'trying', 'get', 'done', 'within', 'senate', 'john', 'cornyn', 'tweeted', 'saturday', 'good', 'idea', 'impeach', 'try', 'former', 'presidents', 'former', 'democratic', 'presidents', 'republicans', 'get', 'majority', 'think', 'best', 'country', 'friday', 'gop', 'lindsey', 'graham', 'south', 'carolina', 'close', 'trump', 'ally', 'helping', 'build', 'legal', 'team', 'urged', 'senate', 'reject', 'idea', 'trial', 'potentially', 'vote', 'dismiss', 'charge', 'suggested', 'republicans', 'scrutinize', 'whether', 'trump', 'words', 'legally', 'john', 'barrasso', 'democrats', 'sending', 'message', 'vitriol', 'donald', 'trump', 'strong', 'hold', 'trial', 'stops', 'biden', 'policy', 'priorities', 'moving', 'ron', 'johnson', 'suggested', 'democrats', 'choosing', 'national', 'security', 'new', 'president', 'tries', 'set', 'administration', 'senate', 'republican', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'last', 'week', 'trump', 'supporters', 'riot', 'vote', 'argued', 'legal', 'strategies', 'kentucky', 'senator', 'gop', 'colleagues', 'vote', 'conscience', 'house', 'speaker', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'nine', 'impeachment', 'managers', 'trump', 'encouragement', 'loyalists', 'riot', 'extraordinarily', 'heinous', 'presidential', 'crime', 'think', 'see', 'put', 'together', 'case', 'compelling', 'facts', 'law', 'reveal', 'president', 'madeleine', 'dean', 'mean', 'think', 'back', 'weeks', 'ago', 'president', 'assembled', 'mob', 'ellipse', 'white', 'house', 'incited', 'words', 'lit', 'match', 'trump', 'supporters', 'invaded', 'capitol', 'interrupted', 'electoral', 'count', 'falsely', 'claimed', 'massive', 'fraud', 'election', 'stolen', 'biden', 'trump', 'claims', 'roundly', 'rejected', 'courts', 'including', 'judges', 'appointed', 'trump', 'state', 'election', 'officials', 'chris', 'coons', 'interview', 'associated', 'press', 'sunday', 'hopes', 'evolving', 'clarity', 'details', 'happened', 'make', 'clearer', 'colleagues', 'american', 'people', 'need', 'accountability', 'coons', 'questioned', 'colleagues', 'capitol', 'day', 'see', 'insurrection', 'anything', 'violation', 'tradition', 'peaceful', 'transfers', 'power', 'critical', 'moment', 'american', 'history', 'look', 'look', 'hard', 'coons', 'rubio', 'romney', 'news', 'sunday', 'cotton', 'appeared', 'news', 'channel', 'morning', 'futures', 'romney', 'union', 'dean', 'rounds', 'interviewed', 'nbc', 'press']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-op-ed-trump-impeachment-acquittal-vote,FOX,"McConnell says he was defending Constitution, not Trump, with impeachment acquittal vote","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said he was defending the U.S. Constitution, and not Donald Trump, by voting to acquit the former president of an impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection.","February 16, 2021 10:59am EST","fox news flash top headlines are here. check out what's clicking on foxnews.com. 'there is no question former president trump bears moral responsibility,' mcconnell wrote, saying his supporters stormed the capitol because of the 'unhinged falsehoods he shouted into the world's largest megaphone.' mcconnell called trump's behaviorduring and after the riot 'unconscionable' and said he was 'as outraged as any member of congress.' 'but senators take our own oaths. our job wasn't to find some way, any way, to inflict a punishment,' he wrote. 'the senate's first and foundational duty was to protect the constitution.' trump was the first president in u.s.history to be impeached twice,and the first president out of office to go through an impeachment proceeding. 'the house's 'sole power of impeachment'and the senate's 'sole power to try all impeachments'would constitute an unlimited circular logic with no stopping point at former officers,' he continued. 'any private citizen could be disqualified. this is why one house manager had to argue the senate possesses 'absolute, unqualified'jurisdiction. but nobody really accepts that.' mcconnell said his positionalignswith 'the early constitutional scholar justice joseph story,' who observed that 'while disqualification is optional, removal is mandatory on conviction.' 'the constitution presupposes that anyone convicted by the senate must have an office from which to be removed,' mcconnell explained. 'this doesn’t mean leaving office provides immunity from accountability. former officials are 'still liable to be tried and punished in the ordinary tribunals of justice.'criminal law and civil litigation ensure there is no so-called january exemption.' fox news reported last week that there is a criminal investigation in georgia into whether trump broke any laws with his phone call to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger in which he asked raffensperger to 'find' enough votes to hand the state to trump. mcconnell shifted, saying there is a 'modern reflex to demand total satisfaction from every news cycle.' 'but impeachment is not some final moral tribunal. it is a specific tool with a narrow purpose: restraining government officers,' he explained. 'the instant donald trump ceased being the president, he exited the senate’s jurisdiction.' mcconnell said he respects his senate colleagues who voted to convict,acknowledging that the text is 'unclear.' democrats have blamed mcconnell for not bringing the senate back into session to consider the article of impeachment that was passed by house on jan. 13, one week before trump left office. mcconnell countered that 'no remotely fair or regular senate process could have started and finished in less than one week,' saying that 'even the brisk impeachment process we just concluded took 19 days.' rushing the senate back into session would have 'shredded due process and ignited a constitutional crisis in a footrace to outrun our loss of jurisdiction,' he wrote. 'this selective disregard for rules and norms is a civic disease that is spreading through the political left,' he said. brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",2021-02-16,-0.9596,Very Negative,"['news', 'flash', 'top', 'headlines', 'check', 'clicking', 'question', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'bears', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'mcconnell', 'wrote', 'saying', 'supporters', 'stormed', 'capitol', 'falsehoods', 'shouted', 'world', 'largest', 'megaphone', 'mcconnell', 'called', 'trump', 'behaviorduring', 'riot', 'outraged', 'member', 'congress', 'senators', 'oaths', 'job', 'find', 'way', 'way', 'inflict', 'punishment', 'wrote', 'senate', 'foundational', 'duty', 'protect', 'constitution', 'trump', 'president', 'impeached', 'twice', 'president', 'office', 'go', 'impeachment', 'proceeding', 'house', 'power', 'senate', 'power', 'try', 'constitute', 'unlimited', 'circular', 'logic', 'stopping', 'point', 'former', 'officers', 'continued', 'private', 'citizen', 'disqualified', 'house', 'manager', 'argue', 'senate', 'possesses', 'nobody', 'really', 'accepts', 'mcconnell', 'positionalignswith', 'early', 'constitutional', 'scholar', 'justice', 'joseph', 'story', 'observed', 'disqualification', 'optional', 'removal', 'mandatory', 'conviction', 'constitution', 'presupposes', 'anyone', 'convicted', 'senate', 'must', 'office', 'removed', 'mcconnell', 'explained', 'mean', 'leaving', 'office', 'provides', 'immunity', 'accountability', 'former', 'officials', 'liable', 'tried', 'punished', 'ordinary', 'tribunals', 'justice', 'law', 'civil', 'litigation', 'ensure', 'january', 'exemption', 'news', 'reported', 'last', 'week', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'georgia', 'whether', 'trump', 'broke', 'laws', 'phone', 'call', 'georgia', 'secretary', 'state', 'brad', 'raffensperger', 'asked', 'raffensperger', 'enough', 'votes', 'hand', 'state', 'trump', 'mcconnell', 'shifted', 'saying', 'reflex', 'demand', 'total', 'satisfaction', 'every', 'news', 'cycle', 'impeachment', 'final', 'moral', 'tribunal', 'specific', 'tool', 'narrow', 'purpose', 'restraining', 'government', 'officers', 'explained', 'instant', 'donald', 'trump', 'ceased', 'president', 'exited', 'senate', 'jurisdiction', 'mcconnell', 'respects', 'senate', 'colleagues', 'voted', 'convict', 'acknowledging', 'text', 'democrats', 'blamed', 'mcconnell', 'bringing', 'senate', 'back', 'session', 'consider', 'article', 'impeachment', 'passed', 'house', 'week', 'trump', 'left', 'office', 'mcconnell', 'countered', 'remotely', 'fair', 'regular', 'senate', 'process', 'started', 'finished', 'less', 'week', 'saying', 'brisk', 'impeachment', 'process', 'concluded', 'took', 'days', 'rushing', 'senate', 'back', 'session', 'due', 'process', 'ignited', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'footrace', 'outrun', 'loss', 'jurisdiction', 'wrote', 'selective', 'disregard', 'rules', 'norms', 'civic', 'disease', 'spreading', 'political', 'left', 'brooke', 'singman', 'news', 'digital', 'politics', 'reporter', 'reach', 'brookesingman', 'twitter']"

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/weeks-after-capitol-riot-scars-both-visible-and-invisible-remain,FOX,"Weeks after Capitol riot, scars both visible and invisible remain","The United States Capitol bears ugly scars of that mortifying day. The lesions which remain are the hideous fencing encapsulating the Capitol, draped with spirals of concertina wire. There are the National Guard troops in fatigues, toting M5 carbines, guarding the American Capitol.","January 31, 2021 3:37pm EST","the national guard deployment is extended amid concerns of more unrest; lucas tomlinson reports from the pentagon. i know these aides are hurting. smarting. reeling. they huddled for hours under desks. in a coat closets. in restrooms. barricaded, in rooms, just as they were taught in a post-columbine world. these are the scars which will take time to heal. but they are scars. and scars never disappear. but the scars will remain in heads and hearts long after the troops depart. an unsettling silence cloaks you once you enter the capitol’s secure perimeter these days. you pass through the fencing, showing your pass a few times as you walk. you pass stretches of grass which is the russell senate park. it is a park in name only. the grass is there. some frost in winter. benches. the robert a. taft memorial and carillon, honoring the late senate majority leader. capitol hill was always a hive of activity. aides.tourists.lobbyists.sightseers.senators.journalists.gawkers.joggers.toddlers.policeofficers. before the pandemic, a jumble of humanity. just coming and going. doing the nation’s business. senators rushing to the senate chamber to confirm the assistant interior secretary. or maybe a family just in from spokane who’ve never set foot in dc, pushing a three-year-olds’ stroller, ambling around the grounds. lobbyists piling out of cabs on independence avenue in front of the longworth house office building. now, a stillness. the pandemic hushed the daily bedlam of capitol hill. lawmakers may only show up to vote. and on the house side, some don’t even do that, voting from home. there are aides who haven’t darkened the door in close to a year. there might be a smattering of tourists. some joggers. dog walkers. a funereal silence. that silence is incongruous with the daily scramble of capitol hill. the capitol and its environs are a shell of what they once were. the white marble is still there. the majesty of the dome remains. but that silence is haunting. the silence is a signal. it tells you something bad happened here. i’ve been back at the capitol most days since the riot. i stayed at a hotel close to the capitol around the inauguration – so i could easily get in and out for work. my wife drove me in the other days and dropped me off. if the capitol were locked down like this in any other circumstance, i would likely hire an uber, lyft or take metro. but the pandemic presents a new level of difficulty just getting to work and parking my car.  and then there was the silence. just the rustle of shriveled leaves, clinging to the trees, bombed by tiny ice pellets from the sky. no horns. no cars. no people. the silence is one of those scars. some who work on capitol hill may never return, traumatized by 1/6. that’s a scar, too. and, there’s likely an emerging scar. the capitol won’t be the same. multiple investigations are now underway as to what went wrong at the capitol on 1/6. but one of the most consequential lines came from acting u.s. capitol police chief yogananda pittman. pittman briefed house appropriators about the attack last week. 'in my experience, i do not believe there (were) any preparations that would have allowed for an open campus in which lawful protesters could exercise their first amendment right to free speech, and, at the same time, prevent the attack on the (capitol) grounds that day,' said pittman. yes. there will be discussions about personnel, better communications, and barricades. many reporters picked up on what pittman said about no 'preparations' failing to avert 'the attack.' but there’s another important line from pittman. she used the phrase 'open campus.' that is what the u.s. capitol complex generally was. an open campus. and it remains to be seen if it ever will be again. prior to 1/6, people could traipse about the campus at their leisure. walk across the capitol plaza. pre-pandemic, people could clear security and spend all day wandering around the house and senate office buildings, if they so chose. it didn’t matter if they had an appointment to see someone or not. the capitol itself was closed unless you were there on official business. you could also come to the capitol to watch the house and senate in action from the galleries. the difference between the capitol, and say, the state department, is that the public doesn’t have the right to just show up at an executive branch building and waltz around. even the perimeter. but access to the capitol is quintessentially congressional. it’s a two-way exchange on capitol hill. the people demand to interact with the people who represent them in washington. and lawmakers insist that their constituents have access to them. it’s one of the only ways that american democracy functions. moreover, lawmakers want people to enjoy the grounds. the view from the capitol hill vista, looking westward toward the washington monument and lincoln memorial is one of the most dramatic in the world. so how does congress address this? barricades? appointments? no one on the grounds unless they’ve cleared security blocks away? controlled access? the closures of constitution and independence avenues? they hardened the white house facility in the early 1980s after the west berlin discotheque bombing. they shuttered pennsylvania avenue in front of the white house after the 1995 oklahoma city bombing. that also forced congressional officials to shut off many streets that run between the house and senate office buildings. so what scars will the capitol now bear now? the capitol will be different. more restricted. less access. and the quiet serves as a reminder to the bedlam on january 6. chad pergram

be it a lawmaker? an aide? a journalist? a u.s. capitol police officer? a custodian? and the last few days proved you don’t need airplanes, hijackers, box cutters, chemical weapons, nerve agents, or even firearms to take out the capitol. you just need people. that’s ironic. the capitol serves as the 'the people’s house.' the legislative branch is supposed to be representatives of the people and the states. you can erect all of the barricades you want around the u.s.capitol. build automated barricades on the streets embroidering the capitol complex. keep the air force jet fighters hot 24/7 at joint base andrews across the potomac to shoot down an intruding plane. dispatch sniffer dogs about the capitol grounds. inspect the automobile trunks of staffers who park in the rayburn garage across the street from the capitol. look for guns among tourists entering the dirksen senate office building. but, it turns out, the weapon to pierce the capitol wasn’t a gun. it wasn’t a bomb. it wasn’t a truck. people were the weapon. and it’s what the people who invaded the capitol brought with them. not the homemade napalm, the handguns and the flex-cuffs. the 'tools of conquest' were their thoughts. beliefs. grievances. anger. hostility. the insurrectionists were armed with enough rage, malevolence, and rancor to attempt to tear down the constitutionally-mandated legislative branch of government and sidetrack the counting of the electoral college mandated by the 12th amendment. these were ideas, shifted into gear by people who believed they could extract a dividend by sacking the capitol, maybe taking hostages, and perhaps assassinating american leaders. you can’t defend against that if that’s what people think. and, if they have enough people who believe that who - egged on by the president of the united states - are willing to bull rush the doors and plow underfoot an outmanned u.s. capitol police force, then the gig us up. so even if you survived the capitol siege, people remained your biggest adversary. the problem was people just being around other people. uscp sequestered lawmakers in secure rooms on the capitol complex for hours at a time. everyone huddled together, inhaling the same air. democrats raised issues with some republicans eschewing masks. meantime, the u.s. capitol has been closed for ten months due to the pandemic. but mayhem and chaos reigned on capitol hill on january 6. thousands of demonstrators breached the capitol, the largest number of people to roam the complex since the covid-19 struck. the pandemic has introduced us to all forms of superspreader events. choir practice. a wedding in rural maine. the introduction of a supreme court justice nominee on the white house lawn. and, add to that a dual effort to seize the capitol and disrupt the certification of the electoral college. the cases spiked at the beginning of the new congress early last week. then came word that reps. bonnie watson coleman (d-nj), pramila jayapal (d-wa), and brad schneider (d-il) contracted coronavirus after the capitol mele. remember when house majority leader steny hoyer (d-md) wanted to wrap up funding the government and the covid-19 bill before december 11 so members could leave the capitol, comply with dc health guidelines, and requarantine for the new congress to begin on january 3? well, that was shot to hell as coronavirus negotiations dragged on through a weekend session. there was nearly a government shutdown. and then everyone hustled back to washington to override president trump’s veto of the defense bill in the senate on new year’s day. no wonder everyone’s getting sick. those are just the physical maladies. we haven’t discussed the mental health consequences with all of this. congressional aides, nerves incinerated over the siege, now crafting statements about impeachment and developing strategies for a senate trial. capitol police officers are shaking. they feel that their leaders set them up to fail. they mourn for their fallen colleagues, officers brian sicknick and howard liebengood. and now they have to protect the capitol during an impeachment trial and inauguration? people are people. they are not machines. venison tartare isn’t as raw as the emotions on capitol hill right now. we were dealing with a five-alarm fire. now it’s a forty alarm fire. security measures pop up around the capitol. double fencing. concertina wire worthy of sing sing. members must now pass through magnetometers to enter the house chamber to debate and vote. that immediately spurred protests from reps. jim jordan (r-oh), chip roy (r-tx), marjorie taylor greene (r-ga), lauren boebert (r-co), and rep. rodney davis (r-il), the top goper on the house administration committee. boebert - who raised the ire of washington, dc police chief robert contee last week for packing her sidearm as she loped around capitol hill - held up the line to enter the chamber. she refused to allow uscp officers to inspect her bag. davis yelled at hoyer after uscp officers wouldn’t let him use a staircase near the speaker’s lobby. 'steny, this is bulls--t!' yelled davis. 'rodney, we’re all going through the magnetometers. all of us,' replied hoyer. 'you guys know the threat is not on the interior side of the building,' said davis. 'you’re taking resources completely away from where it needs to be.' hoyer was wrong. it was hardly 'all.' about a dozen other republicans either pushed their way past uscp, confronted them verbally or just shoved past the officers guarding the door. one can argue about the appropriateness of the metal detectors and whether its right to have guns in the chamber now. gopers may have an argument with democrats about them. but do republicans really want to make the job of u.s. capitol police officers harder after all of this? is that truly the hill on which they care to fight? the fight over firearms and masks is central to the entire conflagration. lawmakers don’t trust one another. they don’t trust one another with their safety. it’s one thing to disagree on policy. but when they think the other side is literally coming for them? well, we’ve crossed the rubicon there. why would they work together on an appropriations bill if they think someone on the other side may actually either make them sick or posed a risk to their safety this is different territory. congress is comprised of people. members. aides. u.s. capitol police officers. custodians. they’re all mad. they’re all hurting right now. the sting is palpable. and the only remedy to make things better? people. chad pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for fox news channel (fnc). he joined

Officials and experts agree that officers who were involved in the melee should be fired and charged for their role.,"January 24, 2021 6:08pm EST","sen. mitt romney, r-utah, provides insight into trump’s impeachment trial on ‘fox news sunday.’  most of the officers have not been publicly identified; only a few have been charged. some were identified by online sleuths. others were reported by their colleagues or turned themselves in. communities will question the integrity of officers who attended the rally along with 'individuals who proudly profess racist and divisive viewpoints,' she said. 'it calls into question whether those officers are interested in engaging in policing in a way that builds trust and legitimacy in all communities, including communities of color.' in rocky mount, a virginia town of about 1,000, sgt. thomas robertson and officer jacob fracker face criminal charges after posting a photo of themselves inside the capitol during the riot. according to court records, robertson wrote on social media that the 'left are just mad because we actually attacked the government who is the problem … the right in one day took the f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) u.s. capitol. keep poking us.' robertson said rocky mount is firing the officers, the roanoke times reported sunday. the officers had been suspended without pay as of friday. attempts to contact the officers were unsuccessful and court records do not list lawyers. leaders in rocky mount declined to be interviewed. in a statement, they said the events at the capitol were tragic. 'we stand with and add our support to those who have denounced the violence and illegal activity that took place that day,' said police chief ken criner, capt. mark lovern and town manager james ervin. 'our town and our police department absolutely does not condone illegal or unethical behavior by anyone, including our officers and staff.' on the other side of the country, five seattle officers are under investigation by the city’s office of police accountability. two officers posted photos of themselves on social media while in the district and officials are investigating to determine where they were and what they were doing. three others told supervisors that they went to washington for the events and are being investigated for what they did while there. seattle police chief adrian diaz said his department supports officers’ freedom of speech and that those who were in the nation’s capital will be fired if they 'were directly involved in the insurrection at the u.s. capitol.' but police leaders need to evaluate more than just clear criminal behavior, according to chuck wexler, executive director of the police executive research forum, a policing research and policy group. they must also consider how their actions affect a department’s credibility, he said. andrew myerberg, director of the seattle office of police accountability, said none of the officers now under investigation were involved in those cases. but sakara remmu, cofounder of black lives matter seattle/king county, said the officers should be fired regardless. their public declarations of solidarity with trump fosters not just community distrust, but terror of the entire department, she said.

It was not an armed invasion by a brigade of dangerous White supremacists. Those are lies. Why are they demanding that you believe those lies?","January 14, 2021 11:24pm EST","'tucker carlson tonight' host asks why democrats are calling the capitol hill riot a racist insurrection what happened last weekwas not new or unusual.the riotwas the perfect illustration of why we should oppose all mob action. left uncontrolled, mobs boil over, violence erupts, and people get killed. that has happened many times through human history. that's the way mobs are. wise leaders know that, and it's why they don't encourage mobs. we had hoped that everyone in washington hadlearned that lesson, but of course, they haven't. instead, they're trying to use this moment to increase their own power,so they're lying about what you saw. they're calling it a precisely orchestrated coup attempt. they're telling youthe chewbacca guy you saw onvideo, the guy with the painted face and the viking hat,was actually the leader of some super secretcommando unit here to overthrow our government. it's absurd and insulting, yet it's working. what happened last week is being used to justify the most sweeping crackdown on civil liberties and free speech in the history of this country. you shouldn't be surprised, however. we lived through something similar that showed the template for what they'll do and what they plan to do. over memorial day weekend, george floyd died in minneapolis police custody.the usual frauds and demagogues leveraged that moment to change this country forever. they used hysteria to subdue the population andcrush anyone who dared to ask questions about what they were doing. they tried hard to pull 'tucker carlson tonight' off the air, for example. to this day, theymaintain strict ideological orthodoxy through threats and fearrather than argument and reason. here's what sam coonrod actually said about black lives matter: 'i just can't get on board with a couple things i've read about black lives matter, how they lean towards marxism, and ... they said some negative things about the nuclear family.' sam coonrod isn't for marxism and likes the nuclear family, so we'd better crush him. meanwhile, and this was the point all along, a small number of genuinely radical haters and nihilists have stepped into the void where our national conversation used to be and taken total control of the floor. they say things that virtually no one in this country actually agrees with, but since no one else is allowed to talk, they have a monopoly on what we do next. 'i'd like to see pressure on advertisers to withdraw from fox news so long as it functions as an extremist madrasa, and cable providers should be asked why they distribute channels that peddle lies.' you won't be surprised to learn that the rest of the media, ourcompetitors, strongly agree with that sentiment: the government needs to shut down fox news. people who watch fox news, meanwhile --that would be you -- need to be 'deprogrammed', presumably in some kind of residential facility.reeducation camps, if you will. we can't say specifically what the plan is. honestly, we haven't thought a lot about it. msnbc, though, has thought a lot about it. it turns out that many democrats do, in fact, have some ideas on how to start the process. sandycortez, by the way,has been thinking about this since sociology class at bu and she has concluded that we need a government commission to shut down media outlets that might criticize her. 'you can't just spew disinformation like criticizing sandy cortez!it's not like this isa free country with the first amendment!'well, not anymore. this is all moving pretty fast, but thenit always does move pretty fast. but don't you worry, it's for your safety.you see how that works, right?you're protected when you can't speak. twitter ceo jack dorsey knows that. he looks like a pothead, buthe's pretty clever and he takes the long view on these things. thanks to james o'keefe at project veritas, we know that jack dorsey has plans for the rest of us that will extend far beyond the trump era. silencing donald trump was just the beginning. guess who's next? you are. so this is'much bigger' than silencing just one man, and it's going to go on 'much longer' than just this week. maybe jack dorsey isn't so bright. he just admitted out loud with the rest of them are still denying: this isn't really about donald trump, and it never was. it's definitely not about what happened last week at the capitol. it is about controlling you, and the country you thought was yours, forever. sorry, there's a national crisis going on and we have no choice.",2021-01-14,-0.2828,Slightly Negative,"['carlson', 'tonight', 'host', 'asks', 'democrats', 'calling', 'capitol', 'hill', 'riot', 'racist', 'insurrection', 'happened', 'last', 'weekwas', 'new', 'riotwas', 'perfect', 'illustration', 'oppose', 'mob', 'action', 'left', 'uncontrolled', 'mobs', 'boil', 'violence', 'erupts', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'happened', 'many', 'times', 'human', 'history', 'way', 'mobs', 'wise', 'leaders', 'encourage', 'mobs', 'hoped', 'everyone', 'washington', 'hadlearned', 'lesson', 'course', 'instead', 'trying', 'use', 'moment', 'increase', 'power', 'lying', 'saw', 'calling', 'precisely', 'orchestrated', 'coup', 'attempt', 'telling', 'youthe', 'chewbacca', 'guy', 'saw', 'onvideo', 'guy', 'painted', 'face', 'viking', 'hat', 'actually', 'leader', 'super', 'secretcommando', 'unit', 'overthrow', 'government', 'absurd', 'insulting', 'yet', 'working', 'happened', 'last', 'week', 'used', 'justify', 'sweeping', 'crackdown', 'civil', 'liberties', 'free', 'speech', 'history', 'country', 'surprised', 'however', 'lived', 'something', 'similar', 'showed', 'template', 'plan', 'memorial', 'day', 'weekend', 'george', 'floyd', 'died', 'minneapolis', 'police', 'usual', 'frauds', 'demagogues', 'leveraged', 'moment', 'change', 'country', 'forever', 'used', 'hysteria', 'subdue', 'population', 'andcrush', 'anyone', 'dared', 'ask', 'questions', 'tried', 'hard', 'pull', 'carlson', 'tonight', 'air', 'example', 'day', 'theymaintain', 'strict', 'ideological', 'orthodoxy', 'threats', 'fearrather', 'argument', 'reason', 'sam', 'coonrod', 'actually', 'black', 'lives', 'matter', 'ca', 'get', 'board', 'couple', 'things', 'read', 'black', 'lives', 'matter', 'lean', 'towards', 'marxism', 'negative', 'things', 'nuclear', 'family', 'sam', 'coonrod', 'marxism', 'likes', 'nuclear', 'family', 'better', 'crush', 'meanwhile', 'point', 'along', 'small', 'number', 'genuinely', 'radical', 'haters', 'nihilists', 'stepped', 'void', 'national', 'conversation', 'used', 'taken', 'total', 'control', 'floor', 'say', 'things', 'virtually', 'country', 'actually', 'agrees', 'since', 'else', 'allowed', 'talk', 'monopoly', 'next', 'like', 'see', 'pressure', 'advertisers', 'withdraw', 'news', 'long', 'functions', 'extremist', 'madrasa', 'cable', 'providers', 'asked', 'distribute', 'channels', 'peddle', 'lies', 'wo', 'surprised', 'learn', 'rest', 'media', 'ourcompetitors', 'strongly', 'agree', 'sentiment', 'government', 'needs', 'shut', 'news', 'people', 'watch', 'news', 'meanwhile', 'need', 'presumably', 'kind', 'residential', 'camps', 'ca', 'say', 'specifically', 'plan', 'honestly', 'thought', 'lot', 'msnbc', 'though', 'thought', 'lot', 'turns', 'many', 'democrats', 'fact', 'ideas', 'start', 'process', 'sandycortez', 'way', 'thinking', 'since', 'sociology', 'class', 'bu', 'concluded', 'need', 'government', 'commission', 'shut', 'media', 'outlets', 'might', 'criticize', 'ca', 'spew', 'disinformation', 'like', 'criticizing', 'sandy', 'cortez', 'like', 'isa', 'free', 'country', 'amendment', 'anymore', 'moving', 'pretty', 'fast', 'thenit', 'always', 'move', 'pretty', 'fast', 'worry', 'see', 'works', 'right', 'protected', 'ca', 'speak', 'twitter', 'ceo', 'jack', 'dorsey', 'knows', 'looks', 'like', 'pothead', 'buthe', 'pretty', 'clever', 'takes', 'long', 'view', 'things', 'thanks', 'james', 'project', 'veritas', 'jack', 'dorsey', 'plans', 'rest', 'us', 'extend', 'far', 'beyond', 'trump', 'era', 'silencing', 'donald', 'trump', 'beginning', 'guess', 'next', 'bigger', 'silencing', 'man', 'go', 'longer', 'week', 'maybe', 'jack', 'dorsey', 'bright', 'admitted', 'loud', 'rest', 'still', 'denying', 'really', 'donald', 'trump', 'never', 'definitely', 'happened', 'last', 'week', 'capitol', 'controlling', 'country', 'thought', 'forever', 'sorry', 'national', 'crisis', 'choice']"

'we went 2-1. i would say that’s what we accomplished in the three games, and we played pretty good basketball in stretches,' caris levert said.

'i’m ashamed that it became a savage display of violence that day. and i would have never been there if i had a clue it was going to turn out that way,' lloyd told the judge. 'it was never my intent to be a part of anything that’s so disgraceful to our american people.' in seeking probation for lloyd, prosecutors noted that she was not involved in any violence and destruction or preplanning and coordination of the capitol breach. lloyd was invited by her hairdresser to drive to washington to hear trump speak, her attorney wrote in court documents. u.s. district court judge royce lamberth said he was giving her a 'break,' but didn’t want others to think that probation — and not a stiffer sentence — would be the norm. 'legally, i could give you the six months, but is that really what we want our judiciary to do?' the judge asked. lamberth said he struggled with what would be an appropriate sentence for lloyd because he views the riot as a serious crime. 'this wasn’t a peaceful demonstration the way it turned out. it was not an accident,' he said. 'it was intended to and brought a halt to the very functioning of our government.' he said he was 'especially troubled' by some lawmakers who are seeking to rewrite the history of the capitol riot. 'i don’t know what planet they were on, but there were millions of people in this country that saw what happened on jan. 6 and that saw what you saw and what you just described: a disgrace to our country,' the judge said. in a letter to the judge asking for leniency, lloyd wrote that she was a registered democrat but that she and her husband began supporting trump in 2016 because 'he was standing up for what we believe in.' after her arrest, lloyd’s lawyer gave her a list of books and movies to help her 'see what life is like for others in our country,' lloyd wrote. lloyd said she has sought to educate herself by watching movies such as 'schindler’s list' and the history channel’s 'burning tulsa' and reading bryan stevenson’s 'just mercy.' 'i’ve lived a sheltered life and truly haven’t experienced life the way many have,' lloyd wrote. 'i’ve learned that even though we live in a wonderful country things still need to improve. people of all colors should feel as safe as i do to walk down the street.' four other people — a tennessee man, a maryland man and a virginia couple — have pleaded guilty to the same misdemeanor charge in the last two weeks. earlier wednesday, another man, robert maurice reeder of maryland, admitted to entering the capitol, but his lawyer said he didn’t force his way inside and didn’t damage any property or hurt anyone. 'you need to retreat!' reeder apparently told the officer, an fbi agent wrote in a court filing.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/capitol-riot-9-11-families,FOX,9/11 victims' families outraged over media claims Capitol riot was worse 'to score points politically',"Since the January 6 Capitol riot, when a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the building to disrupt certification of Joe Biden's election victory, some commentators and reporters have claimed it's not just on par with the 9/11 attacks, but actually even worse.","July 17, 2021 7:55am EDT","a journalist ripping how the steele dossier was covered, the white house saying it would work with facebook to flag 'misinformation' on covid-19, and rep. jim clyburn getting four pinocchios for his voter id claim round out today's media headlines. riches and other family members of victims told fox news they're disgusted when they hear of the two events even being compared, let alone suggesting the riot, while stunning and disgraceful, was the darker day. 'it's a shame,' he said. 'are they kidding me? 3,000 peopledied, plus we have more peopledying from the air that was down there … they're comparing it to score points politically. the families are really [angry]. when i talk to them, when they compare it to that, they find that outrageous.' it's become a trend in some liberal circles since the riot to liken it to 9/11, citing that it was a direct attack on the democratic process. the widely condemned assault came on the heels of weeks of unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud by trump and his supporters. rioters smashed windows, beat law enforcement officers, and were heard voicing threats at vice president mike pence, speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and other politicians. on the scale of death and destruction, the two aren't even remotely comparable. thousands died on 9/11 as jihadists crashed three planes into symbols of american might, while a fourth crashed in pennsylvania after heroic passengers interceded. one rioter on jan. 6 was killed and four other deaths were tied to the assault, including capitol police officer brian sicknick, who died of a stroke after being pepper-sprayed in the melee. trump was impeached by the house on a charge of inciting an insurrection before being acquitted in the senate after leaving office. 'it’s unfortunate because we’re coming up in the 20th anniversary,' said debra burlingame, whose brother charles burlingame was murdered while piloting american airlines flight 77, the plane that crashed into the pentagon. 'there are a lot of young people who have no living memory of 9/11 … when you have all these comparisons and analogies, which are inflated and ridiculous, it minimizes what actually happened, and that’s what’s happening here. it’s a deliberate ploy.' 'it is deeply offensive and sad that the brutal and harrowing memories of the worst terrorist attack in american history are being deployed by political partisans,' she wrote. joe connor, whose cousin steven schlag was among the thousands who perished at the world trade center, told fox news there's no comparison. 'they just dehumanize our families for political gain,' he said. 'i guess they call it gaslighting. they can say these things that will make people believe that these riots were worse than the worst thing that happened on american soil. either they're ignorant or they're just really devious and clever, and you can put nothing past them, because if you're willing to lie to that degree … it's a disturbing trend to me.' connor watched the towers fall from his nearby manhattan office. he tried to contact schlag, a bond trader, and never heard from him. 'i saw people jumping out. i saw the sides of the buildings explode. i saw papers floating in the wind, and i tried to call my cousin,' he said. 'no one picked up … the terror, the carnage, the horror of 9/11, 20 years ago. they've forgotten or they think the rest of us have forgotten.' the rhetoric about the riot hasn't been confined to political actors. in may, huffington post white house correspondent s.v. dáte said the riot was worse because usama bin laden and his gang of terrorists 'never threatened the heart of the american experiment.' 'the 1/6 terrorists and donald trump absolutely did exactly that. trump continues that effort today,' he tweeted. he later added the riot was '1000 percent worse.' the rant by dáte was in response to columnist george will's call for the day to be as burned into the american memory as 9/11. don arias, whose brother adam died on 9/11 while working on the 84th floor of the south tower, told fox news it makes his 'blood boil' that anyone of any political stripe would make that comparison. 'clear thinking people see these inflammatory statements as the bulls--t they are,' arias said. 'there’s no comparison.' depauw university professor jeffrey mccall told fox news such rhetoric was irresponsible. 'both were shocking, serious and painful, but they were different in so many ways that trying to compare them with a rating of which is worse is a fool's errand,' he said. 'there is plenty to discuss and criticize with regard to the capitol riot without rhetoric that lessens the harm and destruction of the 9/11 attacks.' 'grizzly joe,' a conservative radio host and former new york policeman, told fox news in an email that the capitol riot was bad enough on its own without invoking 9/11. four of his friends who were killed that day are tattooed on his arm. 'numerous criminals masquerading as self-styled ‘patriots’ (i call them ‘extremists’) fought with police officers and sullied the capitol by virtue of the incursion,' he said. 'it strikes me that if folks need to compare january 6 to 9/11, they have no faith in their ability to portray january 6 as the unfortunate criminal act that it was.' cornell law school professor william a. jacobson, a new york native, feels comparisons of the capitol hill riot and the attacks of sept. 11 are 'obviously over the top' but can’t fathom that pundits truly feel anything could be worse than 9/11. 'the people making the assertion likely don't believe what they are saying,' jacobson told fox news. 'the riot, while it obviously never should have happened, is being exploited by democrats and liberal media.' the riot continues to get fervent coverage as those responsible are protested and congress investigates its root causes. trump, who is blamed by critics for inciting the riot by insisting the election was stolen from him, has continued to insist he truly won it in the months since. the family members of those who died on 9/11 don't want to discount the significance of the capitol riot, but they won't want the memory of their loved ones to be cheapened either. riches' son died on 9/11, but it wasn't until march 25, 2002 that he and his three other sons carried pieces of jimmy's body out of the rubble at ground zero. more than 1,000 other families never got remains to bury. in contrast, after the riot was quelled in january, the senate finished its business that night and certified biden as the president-elect.",2021-07-17,-0.9994,Very Negative,"['journalist', 'ripping',

'during the rioting, she was stuck in place outside the capitol building next to multiple police officers for hours after the rioting began due to the fact that so many people were around her and the area had been locked down,' the lawsuit states. 'later, a neighbor who was unhappy that roice attended the demonstration turned her into the authorities.' roice was interviewed by the fbi and cleared of any wrongdoing. despite never being charged with any crime, the documents show direct messages between roice and baldwin in which he labels her a 'rioter.' 'when i sent the $ for your late brother, out of real respect for his service to this country, i didn’t know you were a january 6th rioter,' baldwin wrote. roice responded: 'protesting is perfectly legal in the country and i’ve already had my sit down with the fbi. thanks, have a nice day!' 'i don’t think so. your activities resulted in the unlawful destruction of government property, the death of a law enforcement officer, an assault on the certification of the presidential election,' baldwin replied. 'i reposted your photo. good luck.' baldwin went on to repost the photo and call roice an 'insurrectionist' to his 2.4 million instagram followers in a since-deleted post. roice, her sister cheyenne and jiennah are suing baldwin over his direct message and the decision to share his belief that roice took part in the rioting. roice and her family say they were inundated with hateful comments shortly after the post went public. the court documents offer examples of some of those comments, the most disturbing from someone who said, 'get raped and die, worthless c--- [kiss emoji]. your brother got what he deserved.' the court documents allege that, rather than walk back his statements, baldwin continued to label roice an 'insurrectionist' and 'rioter' in subsequent comments engaging with critics. representatives for baldwin did not immediately respond to fox news’ request for comment. 'baldwin's conduct was negligent and reckless as he should have known that making the allegations he did against plaintiffs to his millions of followers would cause plaintiffs harm,' the court documents state.

'crowd was dispersed with tear gas.' rogers added, noting the protests were still continuing and the situation remained 'very dangerous.' another lawmaker confirmed the use of tear gas outside the building. 'while working inside we were interrupted by the sound of bangs and smell of tear gas,' rep. sarah liguori tweeted friday evening. 'protestors cleared from the capitol.' heavily-armed officers were seen in and around the legislative building. the crowd of protesters dispersed and lawmakers resumed their legislative schedule in a secure room. 'we are headed to a secure room to go vote,' rogers said. 'everyone is okay and we are finishing our work,' townsend added. 'feeling safe at the capitol as i sit by 3 of my fellow senators who are armed,' added arizona state legislator warren petersen. in the hours following the situation, several members thanked the law enforcement officials who protected the capitol. 'god bless you guys,' exclaimed townsend. 'we are safe inside… god bless law enforcement,' rogers said. the republican caucus of the state senate also commended law enforcement for preventing an 'insurrection.' 'violent pro-abortion protestors' attempts of an insurrection at the arizona state senate were thwarted friday night, thanks to the swift actions from local and state law enforcement,' said kim quintero, the republican caucus' communications director. the gop group said the 'extremist demonstrations' were carried out by people 'forcibly trying to make entry [to the building] by breaking windows and pushing down doors.' 'we are incredibly thankful for our local law enforcement who quickly intervened during what could have been a destructive and dangerous situation for our members, staff, and public inside the senate,' said senate president karen fann. friday was the last day of the session for state senators, who wrapped up a series of votes after the disruption. as of june 24, planned parenthood of arizona paused all abortions, both medical and surgical. seven of nine licensed providers in the state immediately halted abortions, according to az central. arizona has competing laws that either completely ban the procedure or limit it to 15 weeks after a woman becomes pregnant. arizona gov. doug ducey signed the law limiting abortions to 15 weeks in march. the old law, created in arizona's territorial days, strictly prohibits abortion. it also calls for a mandatory prison sentence oftwo to five years for violators. the only exception to the ban is for abortions that are necessary to save a woman's life. the state senate's republican majority said friday that the old law totally banning abortion is enforceable. for now, it remains unclear which law will take precedence. the state court system, likely the arizona supreme court, will have to settle the issue. at least 13 states previously passed so-called 'trigger laws' which ban most abortions, following the high court's decision. these will take effect immediately or within weeks of roe v. wade being overturned. these states include arkansas, idaho, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, missouri, north dakota, oklahoma, south dakota, tennessee, texas, utah and wyoming, according to the guttmacher institute, a pro-abortion rights research group.",2022-06-25,-0.0428,Neutral,"['protesters', 'demonstrated', 'banged',

https://www.foxnews.com/us/capitol-police-chief-intelligence-militias-building-biden-congress,FOX,Capitol Police chief: Intelligence suggests militias aim to 'blow up' building when Biden addresses Congress,"There is new intelligence suggesting militia groups have expressed a desire to ""blow up"" the Capitol building and ""kill as many members as possible"" on the day President Biden addresses Congress, U.S. Capitol Police Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman revealed Thursday during a House hearing regarding the Jan. 6 insurrection.","February 25, 2021 2:43pm EST","'we know that the insurrectionists that attacked the capitol weren’t only interested in attacking members of congress and officers: they wanted to send a symbolic message to the nation as to who was in charge of that legislative process,' she added. the u.s. capitol police did not return an email and voicemail left by fox news thursday. pittman brought up the matter after questions fromseveral lawmakers about fencingand restrictions to pedestrian traffic, as well as the ongoing national guard presence, at the capitol complex over a month after the insurrection on jan. 6.rep. jamie herrera beutler, r-wash., said such measures make'the seat of democracy look like a military base.' 'we have no intention of keeping the national guard soldiers or that fencing any longer than what is actually needed,' pittman responded.'we are actively working on a scaled-down approach so that we can make sure we address three primary variables: one is the known threat to the environment, two is the infrastructure vulnerabilities and then that third variable is the limitations that u.s. capitol police knows that it has as it relates to human capital and technology resources.' 'but based on that information,' pittman continued,'we think that it is prudent that capitol police maintain its enhanced and robust security posture until we address those vulnerabilities going forward.' the white house has not yet scheduled a date for biden to deliver his first address to a joint session of congress, althoughthe president had suggested it would take place this month.  traditionally,presidents havegiven a speech to congress during their first year in office, often in february. theaddress to a joint session of congress is like a state of the union, though it technically is not called that until the president’s second year in office. in responding to aseparate line of questioning by rep. katherine clark, d-mass., pittman on thursdaysaid no evidence suggested that the race of those attending the jan. 6 pro-trump rally in washington, d.c., affected how the u.s. capitol police interpreted intelligence beforehand or adjusted its security posture that day leading up to the insurrection at the capitol. 'do you believe that institutional racism, that a culture of white supremacy, and i’m not saying any specific person or one action, do you think there was a discrepancy between the intelligence received and the assessment of likely violence and preparation that left officers at mercy of the mob?' clark asked. 'as the first black and female chief of this department, i take any allegation of any inequitable policing extremely seriously,'pittman.'i can assure you that there is no evidence that suggest any discrepancy based on security posture or making enhancements or not based upon race.' pittman said she did take steps during the black lives matter movement to hold town hallsto address police morale and increased training on unconscious and implicit bias, and explain that she understands –as the mother of two black sons –that differences in policing do exist based on institutional racism. the u.s. secret service screened at least 15,000 people at the ellipse on jan. 6, and another 15,000 outside the ellipse, pittman said. security camera footage showed that those crowds later made their way to the capitol. the house appropriations subcommittee hearing thursdayon the jan. 6 attack on the u.s. capitol also included testimony fromacting house sergeant-at-arms timothy blodgett. danielle wallace is a reporter for fox news digital covering politics, crime, police and more. story tips can be sent to danielle.wallace@fox.com and on twitter: @danimwallace.",2021-02-25,-0.4861,Slightly Negative,"['insurrectionists', 'attacked', 'capitol', 'interested', 'attacking', 'members', 'congress', 'officers', 'wanted', 'send', 'symbolic', 'message', 'nation', 'charge', 'legislative', 'process', 'added', 'capitol', 'police', 'return', 'email', 'voicemail', 'left', 'news', 'thursday', 'pittman', 'brought', 'matter', 'questions', 'fromseveral', 'lawmakers', 'fencingand', 'restrictions', 'pedestrian', 'traffic', 'well', 'ongoing', 'national', 'guard', 'presence', 'capitol', 'complex', 'month', 'insurrection', 'jamie', 'herrera', 'beutler', 'measures', 'seat', 'democracy', 'look', 'like', 'military', 'base', 'intention', 'keeping', 'national', 'guard', 'soldiers', 'fencing', 'longer', 'actually', 'needed', 'pittman', 'responded', 'actively', 'working', 'approach', 'make', 'sure', 'address', 'three', 'primary', 'variables', 'known', 'threat', 'environment', 'infrastructure', 'vulnerabilities', 'third', 'variable', 'limitations', 'capitol', 'police', 'knows', 'relates', 'human', 'capital', 'technology', 'resources', 'based', 'information', 'pittman', 'continued', 'think', 'prudent', 'capitol', 'police', 'maintain', 'enhanced', 'robust', 'security', 'posture', 'address', 'vulnerabilities', 'forward', 'white', 'house', 'yet', 'scheduled', 'date', 'biden', 'deliver', 'address', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'althoughthe', 'president', 'suggested', 'place', 'month', 'traditionally', 'presidents', 'havegiven', 'speech', 'congress', 'year', 'office', 'often', 'february', 'theaddress', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'like', 'state', 'union', 'though', 'technically', 'called', 'president', 'second', 'year', 'office', 'responding', 'aseparate', 'line', 'questioning', 'katherine', 'clark', 'pittman', 'thursdaysaid', 'evidence', 'suggested', 'race', 'attending', 'rally', 'washington', 'affected', 'capitol', 'police', 'interpreted', 'intelligence', 'beforehand', 'adjusted', 'security', 'posture', 'day', 'leading', 'insurrection', 'capitol', 'believe', 'institutional', 'racism', 'culture', 'white', 'supremacy', 'saying', 'specific', 'person', 'action', 'think', 'discrepancy', 'intelligence', 'received', 'assessment', 'likely', 'violence', 'preparation', 'left', 'officers', 'mercy', 'mob', 'clark', 'asked', 'black', 'female', 'chief', 'department', 'allegation', 'inequitable', 'policing', 'extremely', 'seriously', 'assure', 'evidence', 'suggest', 'discrepancy', 'based', 'security', 'posture', 'making', 'enhancements', 'based', 'upon', 'race', 'pittman', 'steps', 'black', 'lives', 'matter', 'movement', 'hold', 'town', 'hallsto', 'address', 'police', 'morale', 'increased', 'training', 'unconscious', 'implicit', 'bias', 'explain', 'understands', 'mother', 'black', 'sons', 'differences', 'policing', 'exist', 'based', 'institutional', 'racism', 'secret', 'service', 'screened', 'least', 'people', 'ellipse', 'another', 'outside', 'ellipse', 'pittman', 'security', 'camera', 'footage', 'showed', 'crowds', 'later', 'made', 'way', 'capitol', 'house', 'appropriations', 'subcommittee', 'hearing', 'thursdayon', 'attack', 'capitol', 'included', 'testimony', 'fromacting', 'house', 'timothy', 'blodgett', 'danielle', 'wallace', 'reporter', 'news', 'digital', 'covering', 'politics', 'crime', 'police', 'story', 'tips', 'sent', 'twitter', 'danimwallace']"
