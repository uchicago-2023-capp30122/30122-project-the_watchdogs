  "text": "GOP Leader Mitch McConnell made clear this week that the deadly events on January 6, 2021, were a \u201cviolent insurrection\u201d meant to stop the peaceful transfer of power \u2013 a comment prompting backlash from a number of House and Senate Republicans. \u201cIt was mostly a peaceful protest,\u201d Rep. Michael Cloud, a Texas Republican, said Wednesday in response to McConnell. \u201cThe word \u2018insurrection\u2019 is politically charged propaganda,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.McConnell isn\u2019t moved. \u201cThis is pretty simple,\u201d McConnell told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe are in the middle of a national crime wave. The Republican Party is a pro-police, tough-on-crime party. And I am a pro-police, tough-on-crime Republican across the board.\u201d McConnell\u2019s comments are a sign that GOP leaders are wary that continuing to downplay the events of January 6 could undermine the Republican effort to take back Congress \u2013 especially as they try to position themselves as the party best suited to handle crime waves in the United States. Moreover, the GOP leader has drawn a firm line against efforts to whitewash the attack \u2013 which he has pointedly blamed on former President Donald Trump \u2013 even though he voted to acquit Trump in his impeachment trial following the US Capitol attack and opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6.McConnell, who first used the term \u201cinsurrection\u201d on January 6, 2021, has tried to shift the focus and instead unite his party squarely against President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. But the back-and-forth this week over how to treat the insurrection illustrates the continued complication of moving past it, as Trump continues to push the lie that the election was stolen while withholding critical endorsements until Republicans side with him.The divide broke back open last Friday when the Republican National Convention used the words \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d in a resolution censuring GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for their roles on the House select committee investigating the insurrection, prompting McConnell to push back against the move. Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, speaks during a business meeting of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 19, 2021. Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThree words that sparked GOP firestorm were not part of early draft of Cheney-Kinzinger resolutionSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, McConnell rebuked the party committee for \u201cpicking and choosing Republicans who ought to be supported\u201d as he also condemned the attack as a \u201cviolent insurrection.\u201d Many Republicans weren\u2019t having it. \u201cMitch McConnell should be ashamed of himself,\u201d said freshman Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican who was supposed to serve on the January 6 select committee before House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled his picks in protest over Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s handling of the matter.Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, the former head of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, echoed a similar sentiment about McConnell: \u201cHe was wrong. It was a riot.\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who led the charge to challenge the 2020 election results in Congress, also called McConnell\u2019s assessment \u201cincorrect.\u201d \u201cIt was a political demonstration, that, by the way, is totally lawful,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cBut when you cross over into violence by attacking cops, breaking laws, that\u2019s not First Amendment speech.\u201d Since last week, RNC officials have sought to clean up the controversy, arguing that the committee condemns the violence from the attack and said it censured Kinzinger and Cheney for joining a probe they say is squarely designed to hurt Republicans. Sen. John Cornyn, the Texas Republican and member of McConnell\u2019s leadership team, said that the Kentucky Republican was telling the truth \u2013 even if some disagree. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally on September 25, 2021 in Perry, Georgia. Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker, Georgia Secretary of State candidate Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), and Georgia Lieutenant Gubernatorial candidate State Sen. Burt Jones (R-GA) also appeared as guests at the rally. Sean Rayford/Getty ImagesTrump sets off yet another GOP civil war, risking party's midterm strategy\u201cThat\u2019s the responsibility that goes along with being the leader,\u201d Cornyn said.But there\u2019s a division within the Texas delegation on that issue. Cruz, who had been referring to the events of January 6 as a \u201cviolent terrorist attack\u201d until getting blowback from the right, rejected the GOP leader\u2019s comments on Wednesday, saying: \u201cI think it is a mistake for Republicans to repeat the political propaganda and the corporate media.\u201d Even though a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 election results, a number of Republicans won\u2019t say it was an \u201cinsurrection,\u201d which is defined as a violent attempt to take control of a government. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would go that far. But it was something that we\u2019re not proud of,\u201d said Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. \u201cIt was violent. I just wouldn\u2019t call it an insurrection.\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Trump ally who will face a competitive reelection race this fall, also acknowledged there was violence on January 6 and said he condemned it. But Johnson added: \u201cWhat I will say is, there were not thousands of armed insurrectionists.\u201d There were, in fact, rioters who showed up to the Capitol with weapons and military style gear \u2013 while the Justice Department has said that more than 75 people have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. Meanwhile, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said the \u201csmall portion\u201d of people who broke the law on January 6 deserved to be prosecuted and punished, but \u201cit was not an attempt to overthrow the government. It was not.\u201d Joshua Roberts/Getty ImagesMitch McConnell just smacked down the RNCEven the Republicans who defended McConnell\u2019s right to speak out have steered clear of using the \u201cI\u201d word when referring to the Capitol attack. Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Senate GOP campaign committee, would not say if he agreed with McConnell\u2019s use of the term \u201cviolent insurrection.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always said is it violated the law, and people ought to be prosecuted,\u201d he said Wednesday when asked if he backed the leader\u2019s characterization. \u201cIt could have probably had some less ugliness to it, but it was a demonstration,\u201d added Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stand in [McConnell\u2019s] shoes, he\u2019s a good man. But it\u2019s all how people see it. I was here, and I didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d Despite the intra-party divisions over January 6,McConnell \u2013 who hasn\u2019t spoken to Trump since the attack \u2013 has managed to maintain a good standing inside his conference, even amid a near weekly barrage of criticism from Trump. The former President blasted out yet another statement Wednesday tearing into the GOP leader for breaking with the RNC. \u201cMitch McConnell does not speak for the Republican Party, and does not represent the views of the vast majority of its voters,\u201d Trump said in the statement. McConnell\u2019s rebuke of the RNC was a stark split from House Minority Leader McCarthy, who has sought to keep his conference closely aligned with Trump. \u201cThe RNC put out their resolution, I think they have a right to do their resolution and what they wanted,\u201d McCarthy said Wednesday. Asked if he agrees with McConnell that January 6 was a violent insurrection, McCarthy told CNN: \u201cYeah. I agree. Anyone who broke into this building, I mean, no one would disagree with that.\u201dYet plenty of Republicans, particularly inside the House GOP, have said they do not concur with McConnell\u2019s language.\u201cI\u2019m not going to defend anybody that committed violence or destruction of property. But that\u2019s not an insurrection,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky. When asked what he considers to be an insurrection, Massie responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but this wasn\u2019t anywhere close.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer and Annie Grayer contributed to this report."

  "text": "\u00a0\u2014\u00a0On the day a House select committee held its first public hearing to glean facts about the January 6 attack at the US Capitol, some Republican lawmakers continued to deceive the public about both the attack and its aftermath. Republican members of Congress made false or misleading claims at press conferences and in TV appearances on Wednesday, all part of their counterprogramming for the nationally televised House hearing that featured searing, emotional testimony from four police officers who responded to the attack. One GOP press conference was held by the party\u2019s House leadership and a second was held by a group of right-wing members of the House caucus. The deceptive claims were nothing new. Multiple Republicans have tried for months to rewrite the history of January 6 \u2013 downplaying what happened, floating baseless conspiracy theories, and inaccurately blaming Democrats. But their Tuesday remarks were particularly notable coming so soon before and after the captivating testimony of the four officers who faced the Capitol mob.Here is a fact check of some of claims the lawmakers made on Tuesday. Republicans minimizing January 6In an interview with Fox News, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana \u2013 who was blocked by Speaker Nancy Pelosi from serving on the committee investigating the Capitol riot \u2013 was asked about those who promoted the narrative that January 6 was a non-violent protest. \u201cI have yet to meet a Republican in Congress who has minimized and doesn\u2019t believe that what happened on January 6 was serious,\u201d Banks said.Facts First: Several Republican members of Congress have worked to downplay the events of January 6 and rewrite the facts of what happened. Senator Ron Johnson has called the Capitol riot \u201cby and large\u2026a peaceful protest\u201d and has said January 6 was \u201cnot an armed insurrection and it was, by-and-large, peaceful.\u201d\u00a0 Republican Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia compared parts of the riot to a \u201cnormal tourist visit\u201d saying that TV footage of the insurrection \u201cshowed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes taking videos and pictures.\u201d Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) questions Intelligence Committee Minority Counsel Stephen Castor and Intelligence Committee Majority Counsel Daniel Goldman during the House impeachment inquiry hearings, Monday Dec. 9, 2019 in Washington, DC. DOUG MILLS/AFP/POOL/Getty ImagesExplosive select committee hearing does little to change the minds of Trump-loyal Republicans about January 6Former President Donald Trump, arguably the leader of the Republican party, has significantly downplayed the events of January 6, telling Fox News in March that there was \u201czero threat\u201d from the rioters and that the rioters were \u201chugging and kissing the police guards.\u201dInstead of downplaying the violence at the hands of Trump supporters that day, other Republicans have falsely claimed Antifa spurred the riot, that the FBI was secretly involved, that the rioters were not Trump supporters and that a police officer executed one of the rioters.\u2018Nonviolent\u2019 rioters locked up as \u2018political prisoners\u2019Right-wing figures \u2013 including many who tried to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 have pushed the false narrative that tons of Trump supporters are being detained as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, and they claim the Biden Justice Department is responsible.A group of House Republicans pushed this misleading narrative at a press conference Tuesday outside the Justice Department, held shortly after the House committee hearing wrapped up.\u201cThere are disturbing reports that some of these prisoners are being abused and held in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day,\u201d claimed Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, an outspoken defender of the January 6 rioters. \u201cThese are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals. These are political prisoners who are now being persecuted and bearing the pain of unjust suffering.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s true that some rioters have complained about their jail conditions. But court records easily debunk Gosar\u2019s lie that these defendants are \u201cnonviolent.\u201d Of the 550 rioters facing charges, only a few dozen are in jail, and most of them are charged with violent crimes.Regarding the several dozen rioters who are behind bars \u2013 they ended up there after a federal judge reviewed the evidence, heard arguments from the Justice Department and the rioters\u2019 attorneys, and ultimately decided that they were too dangerous to release into the community .Pretrial detention is rare, and defendants are innocent until proven guilty. It wasn\u2019t entirely clear if Gosar was talking about all the incarcerated rioters, or just those in solitary confinement. But almost all of the January 6 defendants who are still in jail were charged with assaulting police, bringing weapons to the Capitol, posting death threats, or conspiring with extremist groups.There are also rioters who the Justice Department wanted to lock up but who were released after a detention hearing. This includes some rioters charged with violent crimes or conspiracy, who were released and put on house arrest. These cases debunk the GOP-backed false narrative that the Biden-era Justice Department is unilaterally incarcerating Trump supporters en masse. A few of the Capitol rioters have argued in court that federal prosecutors are targeting them solely because of their pro-Trump views. One judge already rejected this theory. Similar arguments in other Jan. 6 cases are still pending, though they appear unlikely to succeed. Downplaying the number of violent rioters During his speech, Gosar claimed \u201cnearly 200\u201d of \u201cnonviolent\u201d Capitol rioters are behind bars. At the press conference, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs also cited recent testimony from FBI Director Chris Wray to describe the pro-Trump crowds and minimize the presence of violent rioters. Citing Wray\u2019s comments, Biggs said there was a massive throng of people outside the Capitol, a \u201cmuch smaller group that entered the Capitol,\u201d and then claimed the smallest and most violent subset was \u201ca very small group that attacked the Capitol police and vandalized the Capitol.\u201d Facts First: These Republicans are misleadingly playing loose with the numbers. They exaggerated the number of rioters who are still in jail, and undercounted the number of rioters who got violent. While Biggs didn\u2019t specify how many people he considers to be a \u201cvery small group,\u201d roughly one-third of all Capitol rioters facing federal charges have been charged with assaulting police. Every Republican should be required to read Liz Cheney's opening statementThe vast majority of insurrectionists facing criminal charges have been released from jail shortly after getting arrested. More than 550 people have been charged, according to CNN\u2019s latest tally. Only a few dozen have been detained before trial [ibid to internal database]\u2013 and definitely not 200, like Gosar claimed.Biggs\u2019 rhetorical breakdown underplayed the subset of rioters who got violent that day. It\u2019s true that thousands of Trump supporters flocked to Washington, DC, for Trump\u2019s speech at the Ellipse, and many of them remained peaceful and never got anywhere near the Capitol. Only about 800 people breached the complex, according to estimates from law enforcement officials. But his claim that only \u201ca very small group\u201d of rioters in the Capitol were violent is misleading.About 515 rioters were charged within six months of the attack, and roughly 33% were charged with assaulting or resisting police, or assaulting reporters, according to the Justice Department .In addition, about 13% of the 515 rioters were charged with destruction or theft of government property. But some of these defendants overlap with the group of rioters charged with assault. Pelosi and committee assignment In a GOP news conference Tuesday morning designed to push back against the House Select Committee hearing on the Jan. 6 riot, Republicans criticized Pelosi for rejecting two of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s five picks to serve on the committee. Banks, one of the members Pelosi rejected, claimed that the Speaker \u201ccherry picked the members to serve on this committee.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s prewritten a narrative. Only members who will stick to her talking points are allowed to serve on this committee,\u201d Banks said. Facts First: This is misleading. McCarthy chose five Republicans to serve on the committee and Pelosi rejected two of those choices, Reps. Banks and Jim Jordan of Ohio. McCarthy then withdrew his three other choices, Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Troy Nehls of Texas. Nehls, along with Jordan and Banks, objected to the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The House created this committee after Senate Republicans blocked the independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 riot in late May, 54 to 35.In a statement on her decision, Pelosi wrote that \u201cWith respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee.\u201d Pelosi did not elaborate on why, specifically, those two members were rejected.Both Banks and Jordan have spread the false narrative that Pelosi was responsible for security failures on Jan. 6. Last Wednesday Jordan said \u201cthe Speaker was the \u201conly one\u201d who could explain the lack of \u201cproper security presence at the Capitol that day.\u201d Banks tweeted the same day, \u201c@SpeakerPelosi, why did you block the National Guard from protecting the Capitol?\u201d McCarthy has criticized this decision, calling it an \u201cabuse of power\u201d and saying that \u201cPelosi has broken this institution.\u201d The minority leader withdrew his other three choices and Pelosi has appointed two Republicans to the committee, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, both of whom voted to impeach then-President Trump following the Jan. 6 riot. January 6 securityAn hour and a half before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol was set to convene for its first hearing, House Republicans held a news conference Tuesday morning fighting against the hearing, focusing specifically on criticizing Pelosi.During the news conference several prominent Republicans promoted the false narrative that Pelosi was solely responsible for the security on Jan. 6. \u201cThere\u2019s questions into the leadership within the structure of the speaker\u2019s office, where they denied the ability to bring the National Guard here,\u201d McCarthy said.House Republican Whip Steve Scalise said there were questions \u201cabout why Speaker Pelosi didn\u2019t make sure that Capitol Police had all the tools they needed to be prepared for that day.\u201dRep. Elise Stefanik, the number three Republican in the House, said \u201cNancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as Speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on Jan. 6.\u201dFacts First: The Speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. That\u2019s the responsibility of the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the US Capitol Police and approves requests for National Guard assistance. U.S. Capitol Police officer Sgt. Aquilino Gonell becomes emotional as he testifies before the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol on July 27, 2021 at the Canon House Office Building in Washington, DC. Members of law enforcement testified about the attack by supporters of former President Donald Trump on the U.S. Capitol. According to authorities, about 140 police officers were injured when they were trampled, had objects thrown at them, and sprayed with chemical irritants during the insurrection. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images 'January 6 still isn't over for me': Officers testify about mental health and lingering wounds from US Capitol attackJane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the US Capitol Historical Society, told CNN that \u201cthe Speaker of the House does not oversee security of the US Capitol, nor does this official oversee the Capitol Police Board.\u201d Pelosi also cannot unduly influence who is appointed to the Board, which consists of the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms, the Architect of the Capitol and the Chief of the Capitol Police. The Sergeants at Arms are elected and must be confirmed by their respective chambers and the Architect must be confirmed by both chambers of Congress. And according to testimony from the former Capitol Police chief Steven Sund, Pelosi was not involved in the decisions made ahead of Jan. 6 regarding the National Guard. In his testimony before the Senate in February, former US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said that he approached both Sergeants at Arms on the House and Senate side on Jan. 4 to request the National Guard through an Emergency Declaration from the Capitol Police Board. His request, according to Sund, was not approved. Instead, the Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael C. Stenger \u201csuggested I ask (the National Guard) how quickly we could get support if needed and to \u2018lean forward\u2019 in case we had to request assistance on January 6,\u201d according to Sund\u2019s testimony. Following the events of Jan. 6, the US Capitol Police announced it was working \u201cwith Congressional oversight and the Capitol Police Board to obtain the authority to immediately request National Guard assistance if needed without having to wait for board approval.\u201d"

  "text": "se select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection released more than 30 witness interview transcripts Wednesday from key figures who aided former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the likes of conservative attorney John Eastman and one-time national security adviser Michael Flynn.While the transcripts largely confirm that most of these individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination during their interviews with the committee, a review of their complete testimony sheds some new light on the panel\u2019s closed-door depositions. Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows during the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump, testifies during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2022. REUTERS/Evelyn HocksteinEvelyn Hockstein/ReutersExclusive: Trump's former White House ethics lawyer told Cassidy Hutchinson to give misleading testimony to January 6 committee, sources saySeveral of the witnesses whose transcripts were released in full Wednesday appeared in the committee\u2019s report summary that was produced this week, which noted they largely refused to provide substantive answers to the panel\u2019s questions. But at the same time, the transcripts show how witnesses like Eastman and Flynn \u2013 both of whom pushed baseless claims about widespread election fraud \u2013 failed to provide the committee with any proof to validate their assertions. The transcripts obscure the names of House investigators conducting the interviews but do note when members of the panel ask a question.Here is what we learned from the newly released transcripts:Michael Flynn thanked Trump for giving him a pardonFlynn asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question. Flynn did answer a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called \u201cThe America Project,\u201d which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne. He also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him.\u201cBecause I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,\u201d Flynn said, according to the transcript. But when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee\u2019s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition.John Eastman wouldn\u2019t confirm he wrote documents with his name on themConservative lawyer Eastman \u2013 whose role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election has come under scrutiny by the January 6 committee, Department of Justice and state prosecutors in Georgia \u2013 invoked the Fifth Amendment to every question asked by the panel, the transcript of his testimony confirms.Eastman was asked about his role in efforts to overturn the election, including a series of legal memos he authored, meetings with former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff, and communications with lawmakers at every level, the transcript shows.He was also asked about his communications with Trump himself, but in every instance declined to answer. Roger Stone pleaded the Fifth when asked about his ageRoger Stone\u2019s interview with the select committee lasted 51 minutes and he took the Fifth Amendment with every question the panel asked him.Stone did not comment on anything the panel put in front of him including photographs, public statements, video clips of interviews and text messages.The select committee reveals text exchanges between Stone and \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from January 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day. Despite these messages, Stone would not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before January 6 or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set up what has been considered a war room on January 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on January 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all. Jeffrey Clark\u2019s two appearancesFormer Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, whom Trump wanted to install as attorney general, stonewalled the committee over the course of two interviews. When Clark appeared for testimony the first time in November 2021, his lawyer presented to the committee a 12 page letter of objections, which, according to the transcript, included concerns about presidential communications privilege, law enforcement investigation privilege, deliberative process privilege and attorney-client privilege. Included with the letter was a vague letter from a Trump lawyer raising vague concerns about executive privilege. Members of the committee and its staff sparred at length with Clark\u2019s lawyer Harry MacDougald about not just the scope of the objections letter and whether the privilege concerns were legitimate, but also how to even handle the next steps. Clark occasionally chimed in on the legal debate, but answered only a single question of fact on a technical question about a Justice Department email address. When a committee staffer said the panel was going to take a recess to go over the objections letter more closely, Clark and his attorney said they were going to leave the deposition instead. They did so, despite being instructed by the committee tostay while the recess was taken. During the second deposition, held in February 2022, Clark invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 120 times \u2013 including when asked if he had worked at the Justice Department on January 6, 2021. At the outset, his lawyer criticized committee members for suggesting an invocation of the Fifth was an admission of guilt. Proud Boys leader refused to say who paid for group\u2019s travel to DCIn a deposition with former Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio, committee investigators used public-sourced images and videos as well as private phone records and criminal court filings against other members of the Proud Boys, to ask about Tarrio\u2019s connections to other extremist groups, the former president and his allies. Investigators pushed Tarrio to explain who invited him to the White House in December (he said Latinos for Trump president Bianca Gracia) and how well he knew Stone (they were friendly).The committee investigators also used tweets and other quotes from Trump that referenced the January 6 rally and the Proud Boys, including his infamous \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d comment. \u201cI took it to be, like \u2018Hey, the election\u2019s coming up. Stand by,\u2019\u201d Tarrio said of the comment. \u201cI also believe that he meant it, like, \u2018Stand by me as the President,\u2019 like, I\u2019ve never failed \u2013 I think he was more telling that to, like, the American people too. Like I haven\u2019t failed you yet, so just stand behind me.\u201dInvestigators also seemed particularly focused on who paid for Proud Boys to travel to and stay Washington, DC. Tarrio did not provide the committee any information about Proud Boys donors or finances.New details about role of little-known Trump campaign figureThe committee\u2019s interview with Mike Roman \u2013 a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and tasked with Election Day operations \u2013 helps shed light on a little-known campaign figure who has since come under scrutiny by the Justice Department.Roman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination for the committee\u2019s questions about his efforts after the 2020 election. However, he did answer some of the committee\u2019s questions about his activities ahead of Election Day.Roman told investigators that when it came to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I had any interaction with him before the election.\u201d But when asked about his interactions with Giuliani after Election Day, Roman said, \u201cOn the advice of counsel, I assert my constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment and respectfully decline to answer the question.\u201dWhen investigators asked Roman what his understanding was \u2013 before Election Day \u2013 of the role state legislatures play in choosing electoral college electors, Roman said, \u201cI was not focused on that.\u201d Evidence congressional investigators used to question Roman suggests that he later became involved in efforts to push fake slates of electors to help Trump win. Investigators asked Roman about one particular email in which Josh Findlay \u2013 who worked with the Trump campaign and went on to become the Republican National Committee\u2019s national director for election integrity \u2013 told a group of people that Roman had been designated to make sure the fake elector voting took place December 14. When investigators asked Roman about his role, Roman again pleaded the Fifth. He also invoked the Fifth Amendment when it came to questions about how the Trump campaign investigated allegations of voter fraud, efforts to seize voting machines, imposing martial law, and a number of other matters, according to his transcript.Pro-Trump strategist wouldn\u2019t discuss text with GOP Rep. GosarDuring Alexander Bruesewitz\u2019s deposition with the committee earlier this year, the political strategist declined to respond to questions from an investigator about a text GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona sent to a \u201cStop the Steal DM chat\u201d the day of the insurrection.\u201cSo we\u2019re still on January 6, and it looks like at 5:15 p.m. ET. Again, Representative Gosar sends the group a direct message that says, \u2018We\u2019re still on lockdown in the congressional office,\u2019\u201d the investigator said, according to a transcript from the deposition. \u201cAnd he sends it to the entire Stop the Steal group. So were you in communications with Rep. Gosar throughout January 6?\u201d\u201cI respectfully plead the Fifth,\u201d Bruesewitz replied. He went on to invoke the Fifth again in response to a follow up question about why Gosar was \u201csharing that his office was on lockdown with this Stop the Steal group.\u201dCNN previously reported that \u201cStop the Steal\u201d leader Alexander had handed over to the committee thousands of text messages and communication records that include his interactions with members of Congress and Trump\u2019s inner circle leading up to the riot, including ones with Gosar.Nevada GOP chair was asked about Trump and others wanting \u2018full attack mode\u2019 after electionNevada Republican Party chairman Michael McDonald, who served as a false elector for Trump, pleaded the 5th when asked about his plan to go in \u201cfull attack mode\u201d with the former president and his orbit.In a text message, McDonald wrote on November 4 that he \u201cwas on the phone to President, Mark Meadows, Giuliani and they want full attack mode. We\u2019re gonna have a war room meeting in about an hour in the bosses suite.\u201dIn a separate thread that day, McDonald, when asked about a number of claims about irregularities related to the election results, texted, \u201cwe are on it. I have been on the phone this morning with the President, Eric Trump, Mark Meadows and Mayor Giuliani. There is a major plan. We are meeting at the hotel with attorneys and national staff in about 20 minutes.\u201dBut when asked for specific details about these messages, McDonald repeatedly pleaded the 5th.The deposition reveals how the plan for false slates of electors unfolded in Nevada and the integral role that McDonald played in coordinating with Trump\u2019s campaign.New York lawyer Kenneth Chesebro initiated an email chain with a number of individuals, including McDonald, on December 10 saying, \u201cMayor Giyliani and others with the Trump-Pence campaign, including Justin Clark and Nick Trainer, asked me to reach out to you and the other Nevada electors to run point on the plan to have all Trump-Pence electors in all six contested States meet and transmit their votes to Congress on Monday, December 14th.\u201dEven before this email thread, McDonald on November 17 acknowledged in a text conversation that Giuliani \u201ctook over the investigation and legal fight for the President. There\u2019s more to come.\u201dThat same day, McDonald was asked by an individual named Michael Bertrand if the Nevada Republican Party could join onto the Texas lawsuit after the Supreme Court brushed off their challenge, to which McDonald replied, \u201cwe are still pushing it, brother. I\u2019m waiting to hear back from Mayor Giuliani.\u201dWhen it came time to planning the meeting of the fake electors in Nevada on December 14, however, McDonald acknowledged that the Republican National Committee did not want the Nevada GOP to advertise their plans. Two individuals said of McDonald the day before the meeting that the Nevada GOP chairman \u201cwants a smaller group of us,\u201d was \u201cstressing the optics\u201d and was \u201cvery concerned RNC will cut cord if looks bad and steal credit if we do well.\u201dAn individual in a separate thread that same day said of McDonald, \u201che\u2019s concerned that we look like foolish crybabies.\u201dMcDonald would not elaborate on any of the text messages or emails the panel presented him with, nor would he share whether his conversations with members of the Trump campaign or whether he spoke with sitting members of Congress.CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Hannah Rabinowitz, Devan Cole, Holmes Lybrand and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report."
